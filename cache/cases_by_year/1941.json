States Supreme Court\nA.C. FROST & CO. v. COEUR D'ALENE MINES CORPORATION(1941)\nNo. 78\nArgued: Decided: January 20, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ernest L. Wilkinson, John W. Cragun, and Charles J. Kappler, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. W. H. Langroise, of Boise, Idaho, and James A. Wayne, of Wallace, Idaho, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n September 10, 1934, respondent, by a written contract, gave to one Boland 'the sole and exclusive right and option to purchase the whole or any part' of 1,300,000 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n shares of its treasury stock at 10 cents per share, payments to be made in installments. He immediately assigned the contract to petitioner, Frost & Company. April 26, 1935, this was modified as to time and amount of payments. May 15, 1935, another modification authorized respondent to sell optioned stock and credit petitioner with the proceeds above 10 cents per share.\n Petitioner obtained 165,000 shares and paid therefor $16,500. Respondent sold many at prices above 10 cents and gave petitioner credits amounting to $16,306. None of the corporation's shares were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, c. 38, 48 Stat. 74, c. 404, 48 Stat. 881, 905, 15 U.S.C.A.  77a et seq. And upon that alleged ground, in June, 1935, respondent refused delivery of the remaining optioned ones- 855,150.\n By complaint filed in an Idaho state court, March 26, 1937, petitioner charged that respondent had repudiated the option and asked judgment for $16,306, also damages consequent upon breach of the agreement.\n The answer denied liability upon the ground, among others, that the contract 'was entered into in violation of law, and particularly in violation of ... the Security Act of 1933, approved May 27, 1933, and Acts of Congress amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, and particularly in this that the 1,300,000 shares of stock attempted to be sold by the defendant to the said W. J. Boland under said instrument was the treasury stock of the defendant corporation, and had never been registered for sale under said National Securities Act, or Acts amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that the said W. J. Boland knew these facts and knew that the defendant could not legally sell to him the said stock or any part thereof; and defendant alleges that said contract was void ab initio.'\n The cause was tried without a jury. Some evidence tended to show that both parties purposed that petitioner \n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n would sell acquired shares to sundry parties through use of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce.\n The trial court held the option unenforceable so far as not executed because contrary to law; that petitioner could recover the $16,306 credit; also that there could be no recovery for respondent's failure to deliver.\n Upon appeal, the supreme court ruled that, as intended, petitioner sold acquired shares to sundry purchasers, directed deliveries to brokers for resale and 'that all stock offered for sale amounted to public offerings and that interstate means of communication and transportation were used in connection therewith'. 98 P.2d 965, 967. Consequently it declared the agreement void ab initio. Further that the parties must be left in the situation where found. It ordered final judgment for respondent. This action was based wholly on interpretation and application of the Securities Act. Thus a federal question arose which demands determination. Awotin v. Atlas Exchange Bank, \n295 \nU.S. 209, 213\n, 55 S.Ct. 674, 676\n\n\n The essential purpose of the statute is to protect investors by requiring publication of certain information concerning securities before offered for sale.\n Some of its relevant provisions are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner maintains that the record shows there was no public offering of optioned stock within the meaning of the statute and Section 4( 1) is controlling. Considering the interpretation which we adopt it is unnecessary now \n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n to pass upon the point. The Supreme Court of Idaho thought the evidence sufficient to show a public offering and, for present purposes only we may accept that view.\n No provision of the Act declares that in the absence of registration, contracts in contemplation of or having relation to a public offering shall be void. If there has \n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n been no registration, it penalizes the doing of certain designated things- use of the mails, instrumentalities of interstate commerce, etc. It also declares that those who participate in proscribed action shall become liable to purchasers of the securities 'who may sue either at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.' These are the sanctions which Congress has definitely provided in order to insure obedience to the statute. When invoked they must be given effect.\n Although the challenged contract bears no evidence of criminality and is fair upon its face, we are asked to apply a sanction beyond that specified by declaring it \n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n null and void because of relationship to a public offering. The basis for this demand is a supposed federal public policy which requires such annulment in order to secure observance, effectuate the legislative purpose and prevent noxious consequences.\n Courts have often added a sanction to those prescribed for an offense created by statute where the circumstances fairly indicated this would further the essential purpose of the enactment; but we think where the contrary definitely appears-actual hindrance indeed of that purpose-no such addition is permissible. The latter situation is beyond the reason which supports the doctrine now relied upon.\n Here the clear legislative purpose was protection of innocent purchasers of securities. They are given definite remedies inconsistent with the idea that every contract having relation to sales of unregistered shares is absolutely void; and to accept the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court below would probably seriously hinder rather than aid the real purpose of the statute.\n The Securities & Exchange Commission, by permission, has filed a memorandum pointing out how this purpose may be thwarted and the investing public injured if the ruling below is approved. An excerpt from this is copied below. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n The rule that contracts in contravention of public policy are not enforceable came under discussion in Steele v. Drummond, \n275 \nU.S. 199\n, 48 S.Ct. 53, and Twin City Pipe Line Co. v. Harding Glass Co., \n283 \nU.S. 353, 356\n, 357 S., 51 S.Ct. 476, 477, 83 A.L.R. 1168. In the latter the opinion declares, the principle 'should be applied with caution and only in cases plainly within the reasons on which that doctrine rests. It is only because of the dominant public interest that one who, like respondent, has had the benefit of performance by the other party will be permitted to avoid his own promise.'\n The protean basis underlying this doctrine has often been stated thus- No one can lawfully do that which tends to injure the public or is detrimental to the public good. If it definitely appears that enforcement of a contract will not be followed by injurious results, generally, at least, what the parties have agreed to ought not to be struck down.\n Kimen v. Atlas Exchange Bank, \n295 \nU.S. 215\n, 55 S.Ct. 677, and Dietrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190\n, 60 S.Ct. 480, pointed out that whether a contract shall be enforced required consideration of the broad purposes of relevant statutes and the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n probable effect upon this. In both causes the end which Congress intended to accomplish was treated as the controlling factor.\n The Supreme Court of Idaho, we think, misinterpreted and improperly applied the Securities Act.

The Act furnishes one form of protection by insisting that 'every issue of new securities to be sold in interstate commerce shall be accompanied by full publicity and information' to the end that 'no essentially important element attending the issue shall be concealed from the buying public.' Message of the President to the Congress, March 29, 1933. It is obvious that the purposes of the Act would be defeated by any judicial doctrine which prevented the issuing corporation from recovering from the underwriter, and putting to the intended use in its business, the money invested by the public in the issuer. And it would be anomalous to rest such an injury to the investors upon the fact that the transaction in which the securities were distributed violated the Act, which was designed to protect those investors. Compare Sections 11 and 12 which, by implication, permit a purchaser to affirm a sale in violation of the Act. It can scarcely be assumed that any court would render such an unfortunate decision. Yet this would be the logical consequence of applying literally the broad language used by the Supreme Court of Idaho in stating the proposition that the courts will not lend their aid to the parties to a contract that is prohibited by law or is against public policy.\n'It appears to us to be entirely immaterial whether in such a case, the agreement is labelled 'void' or the parties are held to be 'in pari delicto.' There, labels, as often is the case, merely state the conclusion reached, but do not aid in solution of the problem. The ultimate issue is whether the result in the particular case would effectuate or frustrate the purposes of the Act.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR v.

Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., \n312 \nU.S. 287\n, 61 S.Ct. 552, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day, we held that acts of picketing when blended with violence may have a significance which neutralizes the constitutional immunity which such acts would have in isolation. When we took this case, \n310 \nU.S. 620\n, 60 S.Ct. 1081, it seemed to present a similar problem. More thorough study of the record and full argument have reduced the issue to this: is the constitutional guarantee of freedom of discussion infringed by the common law policy of a state forbidding resort to peaceful persuasion through picketing merely because there is no immediate employer-employee dispute?\n A union of those engaged in what the record describes as beauty work unsuccessfully tried to unionize Swing's beauty parlor. Picketing of the shop followed. To enjoin this interference with his business and with the freedom of his workers not to join a union, Swing and his employees began the present suit. In addition, they charged the use of false placards in picketing and forcible behavior towards Swing's customers. A preliminary injunction was granted. Answers were the filed denying violence as well as falsity of the placards. The union also moved to strike the complaint and the trial court, finding the complaint wanting in equity, granted the motion and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The appellate court, one of Illinois' intermediate courts of review, held that the trial court was in error. 298 Ill.App. 63, 18 N.E.2d 258. This action of the appellate court was affirmed by the state supreme court. 372 Ill. 91, 22 N.E.2d 857. It found that the complaint properly invoked equity for three reasons: (1) there was no dis- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n pute between the employer and his immediate employees; (2) the placards were libelous; (3) there were acts of violence. Inasmuch as the supreme court affirmed the issuance merely of a preliminary injunction, we denied certiorari for want of a final judgment. \n309 \nU.S. 659\n, 60 S.Ct. 514. Thereupon, although as we have seen issue had been formally joined on the claims of libel and violence, the appellate court, by a procedure unrevealed by the record and without opinion, entered a permanent injunction ranging from peaceful persuasion to acts of violence. The decree recited 'that this Court and the Supreme Court of this State have held in this case, that, under the law of this State, peaceful picketing or peaceful persuasion are unlawful when conducted by strangers to the employer (i.e., where there is not a proximate relation of employees and employer), and that appellants are entitled in this case to relief by injunction against the threat of such peaceful picketing or persuasion by appellees'. The union sought review of this decree in the supreme court by writ of error. Swing and his employees moved to dismiss the writ because in seeking to obtain it the union had conceded that 'all issues of the case have been settled on prior appeal and that the decree entered by the appellate court is in conformity with the mandate issued' to the appellate court. The writ was dismissed.\n Such is the case as we extract it from a none too clear record. It thus appears that in passing upon the temporary injunction the supreme court of Illinois sustained it in part because of allegations of violence and libel. But our concern is with the final decree of the appellate court. On its face the permanent injunction in that decree rested on the explicit avowal that 'peaceful persuasion' was forbidden in this case because those who were enjoined were not in Swing's employ. Moreover, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n as we have seen, the supreme court of Illinois dismissed proceedings before it to review that decree on representations that the decree was in accordance with its mandate on the temporary injunction.\n Since the case clearly presents a substantial claim of the right to free discussion and since, as we have frequently indicated, that right is to be guarded with a jealous eye, Herndon v. Lowry, \n301 \nU.S. 242, 258\n, 57 S.Ct. 732, 739; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n, 60 S. Ct. 146, 150; United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144\n, 152 note, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783 note, it would be improper to dispose of the case otherwise than on the face of the decree, which is the judgment now under review. We are therefore not called upon to consider the applicability of Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., supra, the circumstances of which obviously present quite a different situation from the controlling allegations of violence and libel made in the present bill.\n All that we have before us, then, is an instance of 'peaceful persuasion' disentangled from violence and free from 'picketing en masse or otherwise conducted' so as to occasion 'imminent and aggravated danger'. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 105\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, 746. We are asked to sustain a decree which for purposes of this case asserts as the common law of a state that there can be no 'peaceful picketing or peaceful persuasion' in relation to any dispute between an employer and a trade union unless the employer's own employees are in controversy with him.\n Such a ban of free communication is inconsistent with the guarantee of freedom of speech. That a state has ample power to regulate the local problems thrown up by modern industry and to preserve the peace is axiomatic. But not even these essential powers are unfettered by the requirements of the Bill of Rights. The \n\n[312 \nU.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n scope of the Fourteenth Amendment is not confined by the notion of a particular state regarding the wise limits of an injunction in an industrial dispute, whether those limits be defined by statute or by the judicial organ of the state. A state cannot exclude workingmen from peacefully exercising the right of free communication by drawing the circle of economic competition between employers and workers so small as to contain only an employer and those directly employed by him. The interdependence of economic interest of all engaged in the same industry has become a commonplace. American Foundries v. Tri-City Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360. The right of free communication cannot therefore be mutilated by denying it to workers, in a dispute with an employer, even though they are not in his employ. Communication by such employees of the facts of a dispute, deemed by them to be relevant to their interests, can no more be barred because of concern for the economic interests against which they are seeking to enlist public opinion than could the utterance protected in Thornhill's case. 'Members of a union might, without special statutory authorization by a state, make known the facts of a labor dispute, for freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.' Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468, 478\n, 57 S.Ct. 857, 862.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n I am unable to agree to the court's disposition of this case. I think the writ should be dismissed or the judgment affirmed. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n The record presents difficult questions concerning Illinois procedure, as to which the parties are in disagreement, and we ought not to attempt to resolve them.\n The respondents filed a complaint in the Circuit Court, on which a temporary injunction issued. The petitioners answered. They also made a motion to dismiss the complaint and that motion was granted, with the result that the temporary injunction was dissolved. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the order dismissing the complaint. From that action an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State, which affirmed the decree of the appellate court. On analysis of the complaint, the Supreme Court found that it charged that no dispute existed between the employer and his employees; that the petitioners had been indulging, and were continuing to indulge, in a series of libels against the respondents; were indulging and were continuing to indulge, in threats and acts of violence. The grounds on which the court sustained the complaint as stating a cause of action in equity are summed up in the conclusion of its opinion thus (372 Ill. 91, 22 N.E.2d 859): 'A State or nation ceases to be sovereign if it tolerates within it any force other than its own, and that force must be such as is established by law, directed by the courts, observing the principles of due process and equal protection of the law. To whatever extent these rules are violated we have lawlessness and under such circumstances a court of equity will not pick and choose among the unlawful acts and threats but will enjoin the whole scheme.'\n Thereafter the record discloses merely that the cause came on for further hearing in the appellate court. We do not know where that hearing was upon the bill and answers or upon the complaint and the motion to dismiss, and the parties are in grave dispute on the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n subject. We do know from the record that the appellate court, after reciting the previous history of the case, including the affirmance of its judgment by the Supreme Court, and a statement that, under the law of Illinois, peaceful picketing is unlawful when conducted by strangers to the employer, coupled with the further statement that the respondents were entitled 'in this case' to relief by injunction against the threat of such peaceful picketing, and that the respondents had maintained their complaint and the equities of the case were with them, the appellate court proceeded to decree 'in accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court of Illinois', that the petitioners should be enjoined from picketing or patrolling respondents' shop, exhibiting signs and placards to persuade persons to refrain from entering the place of business and from acts of violence menacing or coercing persons seeking employment from entering respondents' place of business.\n From this final decree the petitioners sued out a writ of error in the Supreme Court of Illinois and the respondents moved to dismiss it for the reason that the order and opinion on the previous appeal 'finally settles all the rights of the parties'. In the brief filed by the petitioners they stated: 'The writ of error is here presented with knowledge that this court has fully settled all issues of the case in a prior review thewreof and that the decree entered by the Appellate Court is in compliance with the mandate of this court. ... If this court adheres to the position in People v. Militzer, 301 Ill. 284, page 287 (133 N.E. 761), that issues once decided on review will not be again considered on a second review, a final order in this case may properly dismiss the writ of error on the ground that all issues of the case have been settled on prior appeal and that the decree entered by the Appel- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n late Court is in conformity with the mandate issued to the Appellate Court by this Court.'\n The Supreme Court of Illinois, without opinion, sustained the motion and dismissed the writ of error. I am unable to say that this action was an affirmance of any recital in the decree of the appellate court respecting the legality of peaceful picketing disconnected with a continued course of publishing libels, making threats, and using force. If the final decree was right on the ground stated by the Supreme Court in sustaining the temporary injunction; and if, under the Illinois practice, the affirmance of such a correct decree based on a previous opinion of the Supreme Court does not amount to the adoption of a preamble or recital of the decree, then we ought not to reverse the final decree of the Supreme Court, which, on the facts stated in the complaint, is correct when tested by the principles enunciated in Ethyl Gasoline Corporation v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 627, and in Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., October Term, 1940, \n312 \nU.S. 287\n, 61 S.Ct. 552, 85 L.Ed. --, just decided, because of a recital in the decree of the appellate court.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN SURETY CO. v. BETHLEHEM NAT. BANK(1941)\nNo. 29\nArgued: November 12, 1941Decided: December 8, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Rutledge Slattery and Geo. P. Williams, Jr., both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondents. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 315]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts of this case are simple. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had $135,000 on deposit in the Bethlehem National Bank. This deposit was secured by a $125,000 bond, upon which the plaintiff was surety, and by a pledge \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n of government bonds having a par value of $12,000. The bank became insolvent, and a receiver was appointed. Thereafter the Commonwealth obtained, in round figures, $12,500 from the sale of the collateral and $ 54,000 as a 40% dividend on its claim, a total of $66,500. The remaining $ 68,500 was paid by the surety, thereby fully satisfying the Commonwealth's claim. The present suit arose out of three further dividends, of 20%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, declared by the receiver. The surety sought dividend payments on the basis of the original indebtedness, that is, $135,000. The receiver insisted that the extent of the surety's participation must be measured by the sum actually expended to discharge its principal's obligation, to wit, $68,500. Reversing the decision of the District Court, 33 F.Supp. 722, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the receiver's contention. 116 F.2d 75. In view of conflicting expressions by the lower courts upon a question so important in the liquidation of national banks, cf. Maryland Casualty Co. v. Cox, 6 Cir., 104 F.2d 354; Ward v. First National Bank, 8 Cir., 76 F.2d 256; Fouts v. Maryland Casualty Co., 4 Cir., 30 F.2d 357, we brought the case here. \n312 \nU.S. 677\n, 61 S.Ct. 828\n\n\n The National Bank Act provides for the 'ratable' distribution of assets of insolvent national banks. R.S.  5236, 12 U.S.C.  194, 12 U.S.C. A.  194. The question for decision is therefore one of federal law. Deitrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190, 200\n, 201 S., 60 S.Ct. 480, 484, 485; Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131\n, 19 S.Ct. 360; Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275\n, 16 S.Ct. 502; Cook County Nat. Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 2 S.Ct. 561, 564. Congress has seen fit not to anticipate by specific rules solution of problems that inevitably arise in national bank liquidations. Instead, it chose achievement of a 'just and equal distribution' of an insolvent bank's assets through the operation of familiar equitable doctrines evolved by the courts. Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 284\n, 16 S.Ct. 502, 504; Jenkins v. National Surety Co., \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n \n277 \nU.S. 258, 267\n, 48 S.Ct. 445, 446. Among the oldest of these doctrines is the rule of subrogation whereby 'one who has been compelled to pay a debt which ought to have been paid by another is entitled to exercise all the remedies which the creditor possessed against that other'. Sheldon, Subrogation, 2d Ed.,  11; see Hampton v. Phipps, \n108 \nU.S. 260, 263\n, 2 S.Ct. 622, 623; Hodgson v. Shaw, 3 Myl . & K. 183, 191; Hays v. Ward, 4 Johns.Ch. 123, 130, 8 Am.Dec. 554.\n Here the surety was compelled to pay to the Commonwealth $68,500 which ought to have been paid by the bank. Of course it succeeds to the Commonwealth's right to receive payment of $68,500 from the bank-and in no event can the surety receive more. But as a means of enforcing this right the Commonwealth was entitled to share in all future dividends on the basis of its original claim of $135,000. Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131\n, 19 S.Ct. 360. Succeeding to the creditor's right, the surety also succeeds to the creditor's means for enforcing it. The surety is a special kind of secured creditor. For its claim against the principal is secured by its right of subrogation to the remedies of the creditor which it has been compelled to pay. Of course, this right can be availed of only by a surety alert in discharging its duty, Jenkins v. National Surety Co., \n277 \nU.S. 258, 267\n, 48 S.Ct. 445, 446, and one not guilty of inequitable conduct, United States v. Ryder, \n110 \nU.S. 729, 737\n, 4 S.Ct. 196, 199. In other respects a right of subrogation is as much in the nature of a security as is a mortgage.\n A 'ratable' distribution requires that dividends be declared proportionately upon the amount of all claims as they stand on the date of the insolvency. This is settled law. United States ex rel. White v. Knox, \n111 \nU.S. 784, 787\n, 4 S.Ct. 686, 687; Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, supra, 173 U.S. at page 143, 19 S.Ct. at page 365; Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, \n303 \nU.S. 406, 411\n, 58 S.Ct. 612, 614. 'The distribution is to be 'ratable' on the claims as proved or adjudicated; that is, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 318]\n\u00a0\n on one rule of proportion applicable to all alike. In order to be 'ratable,' the claims must manifestly be estimated as of the same point of time, and that date has been adjudged to be the date of the declaration of insolvency'. Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, supra, 173 U.S. at page 143, 19 S.Ct. at page 365. The basis of participation in the bank's assets by the Commonwealth was $135,000, the amount of the claim on the date of insolvency. The amount of the claim having been thus fixed on the date of insolvency, it did not shrink because of the extraneous circumstance of the creditor's forethought in securing partial satisfaction of its loss by going against the collateral and the surety.\n To permit the surety to stand in the shoes of the secured creditor whose claim it has paid does not prejudice the rights of the general creditors. The extent of their participation in the distribution of the Bank's assets was fixed on the day it became insolvent. The surety will receive no greater share than would have been received by the Commonwealth had it not been for the circumstance that its claim was secured by a surety's bond. If, for one reason or another, the surety had withheld payment to the Commonwealth, the latter would have continued to receive dividends on the full amount of its claim, or if, on a nice calculation, the surety had at the outset satisfied its principal's obligation, it would have been entitled to share on the basis of the full amount. On the other hand, if the surety's participation should be limited to the extent now urged by the receiver, the other creditors would profit solely because of fortuitous circumstances and without any relation to reasons of intrinsic fairness. The extent of the participation of the surety, and therefore that of the other creditors, would depend on how, when, and against whom the secured creditor presses its claim. Cf. In re Thompson, D. C., 300 F. 215, 217, 218; Pace v. Pace's Adm'r, 95 Va. 792, 799, 30 S.E. 361, 44 L.R.A. 459. Such a result leaves too much to \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 319]\n\u00a0\n caprice or accident and is wholly at variance with the guiding criterion of 'ratable' distribution. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n A final consideration needs mention. The receiver cites several instances in which the Comptroller of the Currency has stated that the basis of a surety's claim is to be measured by the amounts it has expended. But there is wanting here any long-continued practice which establishes its own law within the permissible area of administrative action. Cf. Inland Waterways Corp. v. Young, \n309 \nU.S. 517, 524\n, 525 S., 60 S.Ct. 646, 650, 651.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n The only virtue possessed by Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131\n, 19 S.Ct. 360, is the fact that it has been on the books for over forty years. It held that a secured creditor could receive dividends on the face amount of his claim even though that claim had been reduced by the value of the collateral between the date of insolvency and the date of distribution. That rule of distribution is inequitable and unfair to the run of depositors. It gives an advantage to the secured creditor unwarranted \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 320]\n\u00a0\n by any provision of his contract. For it treats the claim as wholly unpaid even though it has been partially discharged by liquidation of the collateral. The impact on other creditors is oppressive. Under the rule of the Merrill case a depositor with a $10,000 claim, secured by $5,000 worth of collateral, will be wholly paid if the insolvent bank pays a 50% dividend. On the other hand, an unsecured depositor with a $10,000 claim salvages under those circumstances only $5,000. A rule of distribution which sanctions such a discriminatory result violates the requirement for 'ratable' dividends prescribed by the National Banking Act. R.S.  5236, 12 U.S.C.  194, 12 U.S.C.A.  194. This is no occasion, however, to elaborate on the point. It was fully covered in its historical and legal aspects by the dissenting opinions of Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Gray in the Merrill case.\n The majority of the Court was of the view that whatever might be the power of Congress under the bankruptcy clause of the Constitution, the adoption of the bankruptcy rule,2 in equity would be an invasion of 'prior' contract rights (173 U.S. at page 146, 19 S.Ct. at page 366)-an impairment of obligation \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 321]\n\u00a0\n of contract. And the reason for that conclusion was based on the theory that since 'the creditor's rights in the trust fund are established when the fund is created, collections subsequently made from, or payments subsequently made on, collateral, cannot operate to change the relations between the creditor and his co-creditors in respect of their rights in the fund.' 173 U.S. page 140, 19 S.Ct. page 364. For that reason it was held 'that the claims of creditors are to be determined as of the date of the declaration of insolvency'. 173 U.S. page 147, 19 S.Ct. page 367. There is serious question whether that foundation has not been swept away by William Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, \n245 \nU.S. 597\n, 38 S.Ct. 211.\n Mr. Justice Holmes stated in the Weed case, 245 U.S. page 602, 38 S. Ct. page 213: 'But when the Courts without statute take possession of all the assets of a corporation under a bill like the present and so make it impossible to collect debts except from the Court's hands, they have no warrant for excluding creditors, or for introducing supposed equities other than those determined by the contracts that the debtor was content to make and the creditors to accept. In order to make a distribution possible they must of necessity limit the time for the proof of claims. But they have no authority to give to the filing of the bill the effect of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy so as to exclude any previously made and lawful claim that matures within a reasonable time before distribution can be made.'\n That theory runs counter to the assumption in the Merrill case, 173 U. S. at page 136, 19 S.Ct. at page 363, that a creditor acquires a 'vested interest in the trust fund' antedating distribution. For if that assumption were valid, the claim in the Weed case, which had matured after the proceedings had been instituted, would have been disallowed. Such an assumption would likewise fail to take heed of the admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes that 'supposed equities other than those determined by the contracts that the debtor was content to make and the creditors to accept' are not to be recognized. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 322]\n\u00a0\n Yet, assuming arguendo that the premise of the Merrill case has survived, the answer to the proposition that application of the bankruptcy rule would result in impairment of obligation of contract was completely answered by Mr. Justice White (173 U.S. at page 152, 19 S.Ct. at page 368): '... the preferential right arising from the contract of pledge is no no wise impaired by compelling the creditor to first exercise his preference against the security received from the debtor, and thus confine him to the specific advantage derived from his contract. Further, however, as the contract, construed in connection with the law governing it, restricts the secured as well as the unsecured creditor to a ratable dividend from the general assets, the secured creditor is prevented from enhancing the advantage obtained as a result of the contract for security by proving his claim as if no security existed, since to allow him to so do would destroy the rule of ratable division, subject and subordinate to which the contract was made.' And see Glenn, Liquidation (1935)  530.\n This analysis of the Merrill case is germane to the present problem not merely to focus the historical setting of the rule which we are asked to enforce. It is especially important because we are now asked to extend that rule to a special type of unsecured creditor.\n The surety who seeks its protection has an unsecured claim for $68, 500. It seeks to gain the advantages which a secured creditor with a claim of $135,000 would have, i.e. the right to receive dividends on that basis. To deny the surety that preference would be no invasion of 'prior contract rights', no impairment of obligation of contract, under the theory of the majority in the Merrill case. This surety neither has nor had any claim which was secured. Nor did it have any fixed and liquidated claim at the date of the declaration of insolvency. Its claim was always unsecured and it matured, as in the Weed case, after the appointment of the receiver. Nevertheless, this \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 323]\n\u00a0\n surety, though it would fail to gain the preferred position of a secured creditor under the test of the Merrill case, is allowed to reach that position through the back door of subrogation.\n It is ordinarily true that a surety succeeds to all of the rights and remedies of the creditor including the latter's priority. Lidderdale's Executors v. Executor of Robinson, 12 Wheat. 594. But that is no inexorable rule. As this Court stated in Memphis & Little Rock R.R. Co. v. Dow, \n120 \nU.S. 287, 301\n, 302 S., 7 S.Ct. 482, 488, 489, 'The right of subrogation is not founded on contract. It is a creature of equity; is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of substantial justice.' In determining whether it would be fair or equitable to allow the subrogation to the full extent of the creditor's rights and remedies, consideration will, of course, be given to the prejudice, if any, suffered by other creditors. But the mere fact that the other creditors will not be worse off than if the surety's principal had pressed the claim is not the sole solvent of the problem. We are not dealing with a mechanical rule. The question remains whether justice requires or policy permits the surety to succeed to his principal's privileged position.\n Such considerations frequently are a barrier to any subrogation; at other times they may cut down the rights of the surety and give him less than his principal could exact. Illustrations of the former are German Bank v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 573\n, 13 S.Ct. 702, where subrogation was denied becuase it arose from conduct which was tortious; and United States v. Ryder, \n110 \nU.S. 729\n, 4 S.Ct. 196, where a surety on recognizance bail was denied subrogation to the rights of the United States. In the Ryder case subrogation was denied because, inter alia, its allowance 'would be to aid the bail to get rid of their obligation, and to relieve them from the motives to exert themselves in securing the appearance of the principal. Subrogation to the latter \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 324]\n\u00a0\n remedies would clearly be against public policy by subverting, as far as it might prove effectual, the very object and purpose of the recognizance.' Id., 110 U.S. page 737, 4 S.Ct. page 199.\n Closer in point, however, are those cases which award the surety less rights than his principal had. Thus In re South Philadelphia State Bank's Insolvency, 295 Pa. 433, 145 A. 520, 83 A.L.R. 1123, held that while a surety was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of a State against an insolvent bank, the surety did not in absence of statute3 acquire the State's priority. See Arnold, An Inequitable Preference in Favor of Surety Companies, 36 W.Va.L.Q. 278; (note) 81 U.Pa.L.Rev. 441. The theory of that case is that 'the state's right to a preference over other creditors, being a sovereign right enjoyed for the benefit of all the people, cannot be transferred to individuals except by express legislative sanction.' 295 Pa. page 440, 145 A. page 521, 83 A.L.R. 1123. Though that case represents the minority view in the state courts,4 it is recognition of the healthy principle that application of the rule of subrogation should not be reduced to a conceptualistic formula.\n The sweep of that principle is illustrated by Memphis & Little Rock R. R. Co. v. Dow, supra. In that case the prior lien creditor had a claim with interest at 8%. To allow the surety the same rate of interest would not have put the junior lienor in a worse plight. But this Court disallowed that rate, pointing out (120 U.S. at page 302, 7 S.Ct. at page 489) that the surety was entitled only to reimbursement. A similar approach in this case would be to ascertain the equities of the sure- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 325]\n\u00a0\n ty's claim not by looking for the principal's rights under its contract but for reasons why this surety should be accorded priority over other unsecured creditors. Equity has regard not only for the rights of other creditors (Jenkins v. National Surety Co., \n277 \nU.S. 258\n, 48 S.Ct. 445) but also for the stake which the surety has and which it is asking a court of equity to protect. A court of equity should neither 'come to the aid of one' whose equity is 'subordinate until claims superior in equity' have been satisfied (American Surety Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Mfg. Co., \n296 \nU.S. 133, 136\n, 56 S.Ct. 9, 10), nor create superior equities on behalf of one who can show no more compelling reasons for preferred treatment than can those with whom he competes. Under such an approach this surety would be denied a superior equity.\n Here the surety has only an unsecured claim of $68,500. Any reason for continuation of the discrimination against the general depositors of this bank disappeared when the surety's creditor was paid. No equity has been suggested for allowing this surety preferred treatment. It was paid to assume the risk of insolvency of the bank. It was paid by the bank itself. And it has not been shown that it charged a lower rate because of the rule of the Merrill case. In view of those circumstances it should not be allowed the lion's share. It is entitled to reimbursement but certainly in no greater an amount than the run of depositors. It is no answer to say that such a result would give the general depositors a windfall. Unless subrogation is to be a mechanical formula, this surety should be required to establish its special equity to preferred treatment-reasons why it unlike any other unsecured creditor should enjoy the benefits of the discriminatory rule of the Merrill case.\n Finally, it is suggested that if the surety is not allowed this preference, much will be left to 'caprice or accident', \n\n[314 \nU.S. 314, 326]\n\u00a0\n since the surety would have been entitled to share on the basis of the full amount if it had satisfied the creditor's obligation at the very outset. The answer to that is that we would then have to determine whether the Merrill case has survived the Weed case (see Clark, Proof by Secured Creditors in Insolvency and Receivership Proceedings, 15 Ill.L.Rev. 171) and if so, whether it should be overruled. It is sufficient at this time to say that in view of the flimsy basis on which the Merrill case rests and the oppressive nature of the rule it fashioned, it should not be extended.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in this dissent \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reflecting the special policy of bankruptcy legislation favoring the general creditor against the secured creditor, the rule prevails in bankruptcy that dividends upon the claims of secured creditors 'shall be paid only on the unpaid balance.'  57 sub. h, 30 Stat. 544, 560, 11 U.S.C .  93, sub. h, 11 U.S.C.A.  93, sub. h; 14 Stat. 517, 526. It is settled, however, that the 'bankruptcy' rule is inapplicable to the distribution of assets of insolvent national banks. Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131\n, 19 S.Ct. 360. There is no occasion to reexamine the correctness of that decision, the authority of which has never been questioned here and was again recognized very recently. Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, \n303 \nU.S. 406, 412\n, 58 S.Ct. 612, 614. Although the National Bank Act has been amended many times since its original enactment in 1864, 13 Stat. 114, the provision governing distribution of dividends has remained substantially intact. The construction given the provision in the Merrill case has been left unchanged by Congress. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It should be noticed that the bankruptcy rule, now codified ( Bankruptcy Act  57, sub. h, 11 U.S.C.  93, sub. h, 11 U.S.C.A.  93, sub. h, which allows the secured creditor to receive dividends only on the balance remaining after the value of the security has been deducted from the claim, did not derive from a special statutory provision. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Gray in his dissent in the Merrill case, 173 U.S. at pages 174, 175, 19 S.Ct. at page 377, the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 (5 Stat. 440) had no such provision. Yet its requirement for 'pro rata' distribution ( 5) was recognized by Mr. Justice Story, its draftsman, as permitting a secured creditor to prove only for the balance of his claim as remained after crediting the value of the security. Ex parte City Bank of New Orleans, 3 How. 292, 315. That rule of construction followed the long established English bankruptcy rule. See Mr. Justice White, dissenting, 173 U.S. at pages 153-155, 19 S.Ct. at pages 369, 370. As stated by Lord Eldon in Ex parte Smith, 2 Rose Bank.Rep. 63, 64, until the secured creditor's claim has been reduced by deducting the value of the security 'it is impossible correctly to say what the actual Amount of it is.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] By statute a surety of the United States succeeds to the latter's priority. R.S.  3468, 31 U.S.C.  193, 31 U.S.C.A.  193. It should be noted, however, that though the United States has priority against an insolvent, R.S.  3466, 31 U.S.C.  191, 31 U.S.C.A.  191, that priority has been held not to extend to an insolvent national bank.

COM'N v. THOMPSON(1941)\nNo. 715\nArgued: April 4, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 133]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leffel Gentry, of Little Rock, Ark., and Joseph M. Hill, of Fort Smith, Ark., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James M. Chaney, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case raises questions concerning the right and power of a federal bankruptcy court to revise and re- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n determine for state tax purposes the property value of a railroad ( Missouri Pacific) in reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  205, the state (Arkansas) having already determined such value through its own taxing officials and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by valid state legislation.\n Over the objections of Arkansas officials, the District Court sitting in bankruptcy held that it did have such power. In re Missouri Pac. R. Co., 33 F.Supp. 728. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 8 Cir., 116 F.2d 179. In so holding, both courts relied on section 64, sub. a of the general bankruptcy act, 11 U.S.C.  104(a) (Supp.1939), 11 U.S.C.A.  104, sub. a, as the source of this power. That section, so far as pertinent here, provides 'The debts to have priority, in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates ... shall be ... (4) taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States or any State ...: Provided, ... That, in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of any taxes, such question shall be heard and determined by the (bankruptcy) court ....'\n Petitioners contend that section 64, sub. a is in its entirety inconsistent1 with the aims and purposes of section 77, 11 U.S.C.  205 ( Supp.1939), 11 U.S.C.A.  205, and that it therefore has no application here. That question we need not decide. For we are of opinion that the Congressional language giving \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n to the bankruptcy court power to determine the 'amount or legality' of taxes does not mean that the court is given power to redetermine and revise the property value finally fixed by a state under the circumstances revealed by the trustee's petition, even though that value is the basis used in computing the amount of taxes 'legally due and owing.'\n An explanation of the power, functions, and action of the Arkansas Corporation Commission is essential to a clear understanding of this case. That Commission is a state agency created pursuant to state constitutional requirements. \n2\n It is vested with broad authority in the regulation of railroads, canals, turnpikes, public utilities, motor vehicles, sleeping cars, telephone and telegraph companies, and companies transmitting and distributing gas, oil and electricity. \n3\n Also, in the administration of the state tax laws the Corporation Commission has general and complete supervision and control over the valuation, assessment and equalization of all property. Before entering upon his duties in the assessment of property, each member of the Commission must subscribe to an oath that he will well and truly value and assess all property required to be assessed. 4 The Commission has full power to summon witnesses and hear evidence, but further, before assessments are finally determined, all persons interested have the right, on written application, to appear and be heard. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 140]\n\u00a0\n The Missouri Pacific has been in reorganization under section 77, with respondent as trustee, since 1933. In 1939, as in the preceding years, the railroad's properties were being operated by the trustee. The Commission, after a hearing in which the trustee participated, fixed the value of the railroad's Arkansas property, and levied an assessment for 1939. The trustee's motion for rehearing was heard, considered, and overruled by the Commission. The trustee concedes here that the hearing granted by the Commission was in 'full compliance with all the administrative steps required by the Arkansas statute.' Under controlling Arkansas law, it is provided that 'Within thirty days after the entry on the record of the said Arkansas Corporation Commission of any order made by it, any party aggrieved may file a written motion with any member of such commission or with the secretary thereof praying for appeal from such order to the circuit court of Pulaski County; and thereupon said appeal shall be automatically deemed as granted as a matter of right without any further order.' \n5\n Any party aggrieved by the Circuit Court's decision may then obtain as a matter of right an appeal to the Supreme Court of the state. \n6\n It is provided by statute that preferential standing on the docket be given to appeals from the Commission to the Circuit Court, and from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court.\n The Commission's final order fixing the value of the railroad's property for tax assessment was entered on December 4, 1939. The trustee did not appeal to the Circuit Court of Pulaski County within thirty days as authorized by Arkansas law, and the assessment of the Corporation Commission thereupon became final. Thus tested by Arkansas taxation legislation, the assessed taxes were, in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 141]\n\u00a0\n the language of section 64, sub. a, 'legally due and owing' to the state in the 'amount' fixed by the Commission, and were not subject to further judicial review, unless the special cir umstance that a taxpayer is in bankruptcy or reorganization places it in a separate tax classification different from that of all other Arkansas taxpayers.\n But three months after the expiration of the time allowed by the state for the trustee to appeal from the Commission's order-specifically, on April 11, 1940-the trustee petitioned the bankruptcy court, sitting in Missouri, to determine the 'amount or legality' of the Arkansas tax by revising the property value found by the Corporation Commission and upon which the amount was based. The basis of the trustee's petition was that the Commission had made an overassessment, in that after a hearing it had determined the property to be worth far more than its actual value. This argument rested upon a contention that the Commission had overvalued the property by giving 'predominant weight ... to original cost and to cost of reproduction, and wholly inadequate consideration ... to the market value of the railroad's stocks and bonds and to an enormous reduction in earnings occasioned by general business consideration and to rapid increase of competition from buses, trucks, water and air.' The bankruptcy court was asked to find the Commission's tax assessment illegal upon three grounds: (1) The value determined by the Board was greatly in excess of the fair market value of the railroad's property and therefore there was a violation of that section of Arkansas law which provides that the assessment shall be 'upon the consideration of what a clear fee simple title thereto would sell for under conditions under which that character of property is usually sold.' \n7\n (2) The assessment was in violation of Section 5 of Article 16 of the Constitution of Arkansas which \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 142]\n\u00a0\n provides that all property shall be taxed according to its value and that no one species of property from which a tax may be collected shall be taxed higher than another species of property of equal value, and that all values shall be ascertained so as to make the same equal and uniform throughout the state. (3) The alleged excessive valuation fixed by the Commission was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is thus obvious that the trustee's petition, which the bankruptcy court refused to dismiss, rested entirely upon the assumption that section 64, sub. a(4) gave the bankruptcy court power to hold a completely new hearing in order to set its own value on the property, regardless of the value fixed by the state through its expert and specially constituted quasi-judicial agency. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n But we do not so interpret section 64, sub. a(4). What section 64, sub. a(4) relates to is 'taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt.' And what that section further provides is that 'in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of any taxes, such question shall be heard and determined by the court; ....' Nothing in this language indicates that taxpayers in bankruptcy or reorganization are intended to have the extraordinary privilege of two separate trials, one state and one federal, on an identical issue of controverted fact-the value of the property taxed. Manifestly, whether or not taxes are 'legally due and owing' to a state depends upon the valid laws of that state. Ad valorem taxes depend upon a determination of value. The governmental function of fixing the value for tax purposes has rarely, if ever, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 143]\n\u00a0\n been a judicial function. The 'legality' of the action of Arkansas in entrusting the determination of value to its Corporation Commission is not challenged here, as of course it could not be. If the Commiss on properly found the value of the property, the 'amount' of the taxes is not in question. For it is not asserted that the Commission made an improper arithmetical computation in applying the legal tax rate to the determined property value. It is in this respect, as well as with regard to the dissimilar duties and functions of the state administrative agencies involved, that this case differs from that of New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 \nU.S. 483\n, 27 S.Ct. 137, 141, upon which the trustee here strongly relies. In that case, as here, the relevant provision of section 64, sub. a was relied on as authorizing the bankruptcy court to determine the 'amount or legality' of taxes. New Jersey had imposed a franchise tax upon the outstanding-not the authorized-capital stock of corporations, varying in proportion to the number of shares. A state agency, without a hearing, imposed a tax on the $40,000,000 authorized stock of the company involved, when in fact the company had only $10,000,000 of such stock outstanding. This Court said: 'It may well be doubted whether the board had power to tax any other stock (except that outstanding). But be that as it may,  64 (sub.) a specifically provides that in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of taxes, the same shall be heard and determined by the court, with a view to ascertaining the amount really due. We do not think it was the intention of Congress to conclude the bankruptcy courts by the findings of boards of this character, and that the claim should have been upon the basis of the capital stock actually outstanding.' But in that case the trustee argued in his brief before this Court that under controlling New Jersey law 'the assessors acted ministerially, not judicially', their 'determination was merely \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 144]\n\u00a0\n computation', and their actions exceeded their statutory authority. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The Arkansas Corporation Commission, however, does not act ministerially. On the contrary, it is a quasi-judicial agency entrusted with wide responsibilities in connection with the general tax system of the state. Upon it the state relies for the hearing and determination of matters essential to the maintenance and fair functioning of a uniform tax system. For reasons deemed suitable to it, the state has elected to confide this duty to the same agency which has power to exercise statewide regulatory supervision over public utilities, including railroads. The difficulties in fixing railroad valuations are well known, and have been many times adverted to by this Court. \n10\n The Corporation Commission has been chosen by Arkansas as the ultimate guardian of the rights of the state and its taxpayers, subject only to that judicial review provided for by the state. 'The state has confided those rights to its protection and has trusted to its honor and capacity as it confides the protection of other social relations to the courts of law.' Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 598\n, 27 S.Ct. 326, 329.\n If the trustee had availed himself of his right of appeal to the courts of Arkansas, with an ultimate right of appeal to this Court for final determination of federal questions, it is difficult to believe that it would now be seriously argued that Congress, by section 64, sub. a(4), in- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 132, 145]\n\u00a0\n tended to impose upon the bankruptcy court the unusual power and delicate duty of trying out afresh the facts found by the state with relati n to the value of property. And there is no more reason to assume that Congress intended that the bankruptcy court should fail to give respect to an unappealed determination of value made by the Arkansas Corporation Commission. Bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings today cover a wide area in the business field. But there is nothing in the history of bankruptcy or reorganization legislation to support the theory that Congress intended to set the federal courts up as super-assessment tribunals over state taxing agencies. The express legislative purpose of Arkansas to move towards a more nearly uniform and fairly distributed tax burden through relying on supervision by a single agency could be in large part frustrated by the construction of the Bankruptcy Act for which the trustee here contends. Section 64, sub. a, thus construed, would tend to obstruct, and not to facilitate, the enforcement of state tax laws. \n11\n Nothing in the language of the Act requires such a construction. And the policy of revising and redetermining state tax valuations contended for by the trustee would be a complete reversal of our historic national policy of federal non-interference with the taxing power of states.\n For the reasons given, it is our opinion that the District Court should have dismissed the trustee's petition.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 77(l) provides: 'In proceedings under this section and consistent with the provisions thereof, the jurisdiction and powers of the court, ... and the rights and liabilities of creditors, ... shall be the same as if a voluntary petiti n for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the debtor's petition was filed.'

ALTON R. CO.(1941)\nNo. 293\nArgued: January 14, 1941Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Paul E. Blanchard and Charles J. Faulkner, Jr., both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Douglas F. Smith, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This litigation is the latest episode of a long struggle involving the meat packers. the railroads, and the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company of Chicago.1 Basically, on the merits the issue here presented is whether \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n Armour and Company, one of the packers, is correct in its contention that under the facts of this case the railroads must deliver its shipments of livestock at such a location and in such a manner that it need pay no 'yardage charge' to the Stock Yards Company. The case is here on certiorari (\n311 \nU.S. 627\n, 61 S.Ct. 40, 85 L.Ed. --) from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,2 which affirmed a District Court order dismissing Armour's complaint against the railroads. \n3\n The ground on which the Circuit Court affirmed was that the issues involved presented administrative problems, necessitating primary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n4\n The sole question we find it necessary to decide is whether the Circuit Court was correct in this conclusion.\n It is petitioner's contention that its complaint showed a wilful failure and refusal on the part of the railroads to deliver livestock to petitioner in accordance with the railroads' contractual and common law duties; that instead of delivering to petitioner, the railroads delivered to the Stock Yards Company-contrary to petitioner's express direction-with full knowledge that the Stock Yards Company would not effect a delivery to petitioner without first exacting a yardage charge in addition to the agreed transportation charges set out in the railroads' regular published tariffs; and that petitioner's right to proceed in the courts for such a breach of duty exists under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. Sections 9 and 22, 49 U.S.C.A.  9, 22.5 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n But respondents contend, and both courts below held, that the issues tendered by the complaint are not so simple as petitioner would have them seem. Their view is that adjudication of the issues presented relates to such complex transportation problems that determination of the legal questions must necessarily be preceded by the consideration of extensive evidence in a specialized filed, and that decision of such questions is by statute vested exclusively in the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n6\n Since the cause was dismissed without answer or evidence, it is on the basis of the allegations of the complaint that we must apply the controlling law.\n The factual situation, according to the complaint is as follows: For many years prior to 1933 the railroads held themselves out as ready to transport goods to 'Union Stock Yards, Illinois', and petitioner shipped to itself at that station much livestock from various points of origin in the United States. None of the railroads own or operate a depot or terminal facilities for the unloading and delivery of livestock, but all of them jointly have long had arrangements with the 'Union Stock Yard and Transit Company', a public stock yard, for the use of its terminal facilities. This public stock yard is a common carrier, subject in some respects to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in others to that of the Secretary of Agriculture. Its unloading charges, fixed according to a tariff published and on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, are collected by the railroads from petitioner and other shippers and are in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n turn paid to the Stock Yards Company. \n7\n This charge, however, does not include payment for use of the facilities after unloading and before delivery to consignees, or for any services then performed. To cover these items, the Stock Yards Company collects an additional charge, since 1921 contained in a tariff filed with the Secretary of Agriculture,8 and it is this charge which is at the root of the present controversy.\n In 1933 petitioner, without resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission, demanded that the railroads alter this long-standing practice so as to relieve it from payment of this additional charge. Pursuant to its purpose, petitioner notified the railroads that it would not thereafter utilize any services after unloading; asked that tender of delivery be made to it immediately after unloading so that it could remove its stock to its own plant; avowed its readiness thereafter to accept delivery at such 'reasonable and proper delivery pens of the carrier' at 'Union Stock Yards, Illinois,' as might be provided by the railroads; demanded that the railroads either directly or through their agent, the Stock Yards Company, deliver the consigned stock to petitioner without any charges except those paid for transportation; and declared that delivery to the Stock Yards Company contrary to petitioner's demand would be treated as a conversion of property for which the railroads would be held responsible. Notwithstanding this demand the railroads continued to deliver petitioner's consignments to the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n Stock Yards Company and that Company, over petitioner's protest, continued to exact the controverted charge. The railroad companies knew that delivery to petitioner would only be made by the Stock Yards Company on Company property and with no means of egress save by crossing other property of the Company, for which privilege a charge would be exacted.\n The complaint adds that in spite of this demand the railroads have 'continuously refused to provide or establish by lease or otherwise at their said common station, Union Stock Yards, Illinois, any depot or platforms, pens or facilities' where petitioner might accept delivery of its stock without payment of the controverted charge, and have also 'failed to make any arrangement with its said agent under ... which the plaintiff might have free ingress ... and egress ... to a public street.' Specifically, two breaches are alleged: (1) a breach of duty in failing 'to provide reasonably convenient, accessible and safe unloading pens, at the said common depot or station, at which such livestock could be tendered to plaintiff'; and (2) a breach of contract in 'failing to afford to plaintiff an opportunity of receiving its livestock and of removing the same with reasonable promptness from the unloading pens used by defendants at Union Stock Yards, Chicago, Illinois, or from any point at which delivery thereof is tendered. ...' The contract relied on provides 'That the carrier has received from the shipper ... the livestock ... consigned and destined as indicated below, which the carrier agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination . ...' The usual place of delivery for livestock shipped to Union Stock Yards, Chicago, Illinois, and indeed the only place of delivery ever utilized at that station so far as the complaint shows is the public stock yards.\n The complaint concludes with a prayer for affirmative relief: an adjudication that petitioner is entitled to de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n livery free of any charges other than those filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission; a mandatory injunction to require such delivery; and an accounting for those charges paid under protest.\n This statement of the facts alleged in the complaint reveals that there are many questions relating to complex transportation problems that must be solved as a prerequisite to a determination of whether the railroads, in violation of contracts or governing laws, have failed properly to deliver petitioner's livestock. \n9\n For illustration:\n First. At what point did the common carriers' duty to transport come to an end? Neither the statute nor any applicable principle of governing law can be said to mark this boundary, under all circumstances and conditions and in all cases.\n Second. Under the allegations of the complaint, the practice of delivering livestock to the public stock yards in Chicago, and the practice of the Stock Yards Company of exacting a charge from consignees, are long-standing customs. Shippers, railroads, the Stock Yard Company, and the Interstate Commerce Commission alike have left these practices in effect over a long period of years. If use of the terminal facilities for egress to the street after unloading of livestock is a part of transportation, as petitioner alleges, and if this use is a service for which reasonable compensation is justified, it cannot be doubted that this charge, like the unloading charge, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n is a part of that reasonable transportation rate determination of which is committed to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. And before such long-standing transportation customs can be held illegal, it is of course necessary that evidence be heard.\n Third. If the railroad delivers through the public stock yards, and petitioner's position is sustained, the railroad must necessarily absorb the additional charge. Under the complaint, this would be upon the basis that the railroad had not fully performed its transportation service. Yet the tariff charges for shipping petitioner's livestock were based upon the long-standing custom in which petitioner and the other packers had acquiesced. The railroad is entitled to receive and the shipper is required under the statute to pay a just and reasonable rate. A court judgment in favor of petitioner would reduce the compensation of the railroads for the performance of their services, and would in effect consitute a readjustment of their rate schedules.\n Fourth. If, as petitioner insists, it is the duty of the railroads to provide terminal facilities which they do not now own, possess or control, a drastic change might have to be accomplished by them. Property might have to be acquired, expensive facilities might have to be secured, and correspondingly, rates might have to be adjusted. The need for such steps raises a transportation problem of the greatest magnitude, involving many intricate considerations such as must always play a part in evaluating a claim that new depots and facilities are necessary.\n Fifth. The complaint shows that there is no provision in the tariff which would authorize the railroads to make refunds to petitioner of those charges paid by petitioner to the Stock Yards Company. Such refunds, if made, would be in the nature of special allowances not authorized by the tariff. A court's adjudication of this question in this case would not uniformly benefit all shippers \n\n[312 \nU.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n for whom respondents have transported livestock. Whether or not such a refund would amount to a discrimination should be determined by studies such as those the Interstate Commerce Commission is especially empowered to make.\n Sixth. The complaint alleges that petitioner is willing to accept delivery at any point in the station area. What the station area embraces is not defined. Whether there is property in the area on which the railroads could erect pens is not shown. To decide this issue would require a court to define the boundaries of a station named in a tariff approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n The complexities of the situation here presented are graphically illustrated in the companion case of Swift & Co. v. Alton R. Co., 238 I.C. C. 179. Swift, one of Armour's competitors, took its petition for alteration of the same long-standing practice directly to the Commission. That expert body found it a necessary prerequisite to decision to have a trial examiner conduct extensive hearings, compiling in the process a record of 5 volumes, 1,147 pages, and numerous exhibits. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The principles making up the so-called primary jurisdiction doctrine are well settled. This is obviously a case for their application. The decision below is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Adams v.

The accident, according to the petition, occurred in Butler County, Ohio, a county adjacent to that of respondent's residence, through both of which counties petitioner's railroad ran. The petition further showed that suitable courts, state and federal, were constantly open and that petitioner and the witnesses were available for process therein. It was stated the federal court chosen was seven hundred miles from the residence of the respondent and numerous witnesses; that to present the case properly required the personal attendance of approximately twenty-five locally available witnesses-the crew, inspectors and the medical attendants-at a cost estimated to exceed the cost of the presentation of the case at a convenient point by $4,000, with no resulting benefit to the injured employee. Petitioner asserted these facts established that the continued prosecution of the federal court action would be an undue burden on interstate commerce and an unreasonable, improper and inequitable burden upon petitioner itself.\n The defendant railroad was doing business in the New York district where the damage suit was filed as appears from a copy of the complaint in the federal case made a part of the petition.\n Respondent demurred for failure to state a cause of action and lack of jurisdiction of the subject of the action. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action by an order which was sustained by the Court of Appeals and, on rehearing, by the Supreme \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 49]\n\u00a0\n Court of Ohio.3 The basis for the decision below was that the respondent employee was privileged to enjoy, without interference from a state court, the venue allowed by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The statutory provision in regard to venue is in Section 6 which so far as pertinent reads as follows: 'Under this chapter an action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.' Apr. 5, 1910, c. 143, Sec. 1, 36 Stat. 291, as amended March 3, 1911, c. 231, Sec. 291, 36 Stat. 1167, 45 U.S.C.  56, 45 U.S.C.A.  56.\n When the second Employers' Liability Act was enacted, venue of actions under it was left to the general venue statute, 35 Stat. 65, which fixed the venue of suits in the United States courts based in whole or in part upon the Act in districts of which the defendant was an inhabitant. \n5\n Litigation promptly disclosed what Congress considered deficiencies in such a limitation of the right of railroad employees to bring personal injury actions,6 with the result that the present language was added. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The reason for the addition was said to be the injustice to an injured employee of compelling him to go to the possibly far distant place of habitation of the defendant \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 50]\n\u00a0\n carrier with consequent increased expense for the transportation and maintenance of witnesses, lawyers and parties away from their homes. \n8\n The legislative history throws little light on the reason for the choice of the three standards for determining venue: the residence of the carrier, the place where it is doing business, or the place where the cause of action arose. At one time the amendatory bill fixed venue as 'the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be found at the time of commencing such action.' \n9\n Fears were expressed that so wide a choice might result in injustice to the carrier, p. 2257. No doubt this language was actually considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee as well as the language of the general venue statute for which the Committee was providing an exception. Specific attention was called in the Senate report to the Macon Grocery case, interpreting the general venue statute. That statute placed venue in the residence of either party where the jurisdiction was founded on diversity of citizenship alone. The language finally adopted must have been deliberately chosen to enable the plaintiff, in the words of Senator Borah, who submitted the report on the bill, 'to find the corporation at any point or place or State where it is actually carrying on business, and there lodge his action, if he chooses to do so.' 10\n When petitioner sought an injunction in the Ohio court against the further prosecution of the federal court action in New York, the petition alleged that prosecution of the New York action would entail 'an undue burden' on interstate commerce. No objection to the decree below upon that explicit ground appears in the petition for \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 51]\n\u00a0\n certiorari either in the specification of errors or reasons for granting the writ. In petitioner's brief on the merits, it is pointed out that this Court held in Denver & Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte, \n284 \nU.S. 284\n, 52 S.Ct. 152, that the disadvantages of litigation far from the scene of the accident are not substantial enough to justify a state court in forbidding the continuation of the litigation in a district where the lines of the carrier run. This accords with Hoffman v. State of Missouri ex rel. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S.Ct. 485, 486, where it was said the carrier must 'submit, if there is jurisdiction, to the requirements of orderly, effective administration of justice, although thereby interstate commerce is incidentally burdened.' \n11\n Since the carrier's exhibit of respondent's New York petition shows an allegation that it is doing business in New York, we assume that business to be such as is contemplated by the venue provisions of Section 6. There is therefore no occasion to consider further the suggestion that the suit in New York creates an inadmissible burden upon interstate commerce.\n The real contention of petitioner is that despite the admitted venue respondent is acting in a vexatious and inequitable manner in maintaining the federal court suit in a distant jurisdiction when a convenient and suitable forum is at respondent's doorstep. Under such circumstances petitioner asserts power, abstractly speaking, in the Ohio court to prevent a resident under its jurisdiction \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 52]\n\u00a0\n from doing inequity. Such power does exist. \n12\n In the Matzinger case the Supreme Court of Ohio exercised this power to prevent the continuation of a personal injury suit in Illinois by a resident under its jurisdiction on an Ohio cause of action. Such power has occasionally been exercised by one state over its citizens seeking to enforce in other states remedies under the Employers' Liability Act against defendants, locally available for the litigation. \n13\n At times the injunction has been refused. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n We read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio to express the view that if it were not for Section 6 of the Employers' Liability Act the requested injunction would be granted on the undisputed facts of the petition. Section 6 establishes venue for an action in the federal courts. As such venue is a privilege created by federal statute15 and claimed by respondent the Supreme Court of Ohio felt constrained by the Supremacy Clause to treat Section 6 as decisive of the issue. It is clear that the allowance or denial of this federal privilege is a matter of federal law, not a matter of state law under Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64, 72\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 819, 114 A.L.R. 1487.16 Its correct decision depends upon a construction of a federal act. \n17\n Consequently the action of a state court must be in accord with the federal statute \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 53]\n\u00a0\n and the federal rule as to its application rather than state statute, rule or policy. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner presses upon us the argument that the action of Congress gave an injured railway employee the privilege of extended venue, subject to the usual powers of the state to enjoin what in the judgment of the state courts would be considered an improper use of that privilege. This results, says petitioner, because the Act does not in terms exclude this state power. \n19\n As courts of equity admittedly possessed this power before the enactment of Section 6, the argument continues, it is not to be lightly inferred that the venue privilege was in disregard of this policy. But the federal courts have felt they could not interfere with suits in far federal districts where the inequity alleged was based only on inconvenience. \n20\n There is no occasion to distinguish between the power and the propriety of its exercise in this instance since the limits of the two are here co-extensive. The privilege was granted because the general venue provisions worked injustices to employees. It is obvious that no state statute could vary the venue21 and we think equally true that no state court may inter- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 54]\n\u00a0\n fere with the privilege, for the benefit of the carrier or the national transportation system, on the ground of inequity based on cost, inconvenience or harassment. When the section was enacted it filled the entire field of venue in federal courts. \n22\n A privilege of venue granted by the legislative body which created this right of action cannot be frustrated for reasons of convenience or expense. If it is deemed unjust, the remedy is legislative, a course followed in securing the amendment of April 5, 1910, for the benefit of employees. This Court held in Hoffman v. State of Missouri ex rel. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S.Ct. 485, that the burden on interstate commerce would be disregarded where the carrier had lines in the distant state. The importance of unhampered commerce is at least as great as that of a carrier's freedom from harassing incidents of litigation. Whatever burden there is here upon the railroad because of inconvenience or cost does not outweigh the plain grant of privilege for suit in New York. \n23\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n Disagreement with the views of the majority on the construction of a venue provision does not ordinarily call for expression. But inasmuch as the decision in this case unjustifiably limits long-settled powers of the state courts and thereby brings into disequilibrium the relationship of federal and state courts, I think it proper to express my views. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 55]\n\u00a0\n The decision of the Court seems to be epitomized in this sentence: 'A privilege of venue granted by the legislative body which created this right of action cannot be frustrated for reasons of convenience or expense.' As a general proposition, the suggestion that a privilege of venue granted by the legislative body which creates the right of action 'cannot be frustrated for reasons of convenience or expense' would be as novel as it is untenable. To give unique scope to this venue provision different from the significance accorded all other provisions of venue 'granted by the legislative body which created' the right is no less novel doctrine. For this departure from the effect customarily given to venue provisions, no warrant is avouched in the specific provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the general provisions of legislation defining the relationship between federal and state courts, the principles applied in the decisions of this Court, or settled doctrines of equity jurisdiction. None is avouched because none is available.\n The opinion does not deny the historic power of courts of equity to prevent a misuse of litigation by enjoining resort to vexatious and oppressive foreign suits. See e.g., Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 118- 120, 10 S.Ct. 269, 272, 273; Pere Marquette R. Co. v. Slutz, 268 Mich. 388, 256 N.W. 458; Mason v. Harlow, 84 Kan. 277, 114 P. 218, 33 L.R.A.,N.S., 234; Wilser v. Wilser, 132 Minn. 167, 156 N.W. 271; Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Richey & Gilbert Co., 132 Wash. 526, 232 P. 355; O'Haire v. Burns, 45 Colo. 432, 101 P. 755, 25 L.R.A.,N.S., 267, 132 Am.St.Rep. 191; Miller v. Gittings, 85 Md. 601, 37 A. 372, 37 L.R.A. 654, 60 Am.St.Rep. 352. Nor does it question the familiar doctrine of forum non conveniens under which a court having statutory jurisdiction may decline its facilities to a suit that in justice should be tried elsewhere. See Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Steamships, \n285 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 52 S.Ct. 413, 415; Massachusetts v. Missouri, \n308 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 60 S.Ct. 39, 43; Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n288 \nU.S. 123, 130\n, 131 S., 53 S. Ct. 295, 297, 298, 89 A.L.R. 720. These manifestations of a civilized judicial system are firmly imbedded \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 56]\n\u00a0\n in our law. See Foster, Place of Trial in Civil Actions, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 1217; Blair, The Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens in Anglo-American Law, 29 Col.L.Rev. 1. Nor does the decision give new currency to the discredited notion that there is a general lack of power in the state courts to enjoin proceedings in federal courts. Cf. Princess Lida v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 456, 466\n, 59 S.Ct. 275, 280; Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345. Nothing in Article III of the Constitution or in the legislation by which Congress has vested judicial power in the federal courts justifies such a doctrine.\n And so the basis of the decision of the Court must be found, if anywhere, in the terms of the venue provision of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The section provides, simply, that an action under the Act 'may be brought in a District Court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action', that the jurisdiction of the federal courts shall be 'concurrent' with that of the state courts, and that no action brought in a state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to a federal court. 36 Stat. 291, 45 U.S.C.  56, 45 U.S.C.A.  56. The phrasing of the section is not unique: it follows the familiar pattern generally employed by Congress in framing venue provisions. E.g., 28 U.S.C.  112, 28 U.S.C.A .  112 (suits based upon diversity of citizenship); 28 U.S.C.  53, 28 U. S.C.A.  53 (suits by or against China Trade Act corporations); 28 U.S.C.  104, 28 U.S.C.A.  104 (suits for penalties and forfeitures); 28 U.S.C.  105, 28 U.S.C.A.  105 (suits for recovery of taxes); 28 U.S.C.  41(26)(b ), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(26)(b) (interpleader). The decision cannot rest, therefore, upon any peculiarities of the language of the provision.\n Nor can justification for the Court's conclusion be found in the legislative history of the section or the clearly expressed reasons of policy underlying its enactment. As the House and Senate committee reports show, H.Rept. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 57]\n\u00a0\n No. 513, pp. 6-7, S.Rept. No. 432, pp. 3-4, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., Congress was aware of the hardship by which under the original Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. 65, the plaintiff could bring his action only at the railroad's 'residence'. Cound v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., C.C., 173 F. 527. The amendment of 1910 greatly enlarged the range of a plaintiff's convenience in bringing suit. It is not disputed that the amendment was intended to open to a plaintiff courts from which he previously was barred. But that is not the question before us. The problem is whether the Act was intended to give a plaintiff an absolute and unqualified right to compel trial of his action in any of the specified places he chooses, thereby not only depriving state courts of their old power to protect against unjustly oppressive foreign suits, but also forbidding federal courts to decline jurisdiction 'in the interest of justice' on familiar grounds of forum non conveniens. See Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Steamships, \n285 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 52 S.Ct. 413, 415. Nothing in the history of the 1910 amendment indicates that its framers contemplated any such vast transformation in the established relationship between federal and state courts and in the duty of the federal courts to decline jurisdiction 'in the interest of justice'. On the contrary, the expressed considerations of policy underlying the amendment were fundamentally the same as those underlying the equitable power to restrain oppressive suits and the reciprocal doctrine of forum non conveniens: It does not comport with equity and justice to allow a suit to be litigated in a forum where, on the balance, unnecessary hardship and inconvenience would be cast upon one party without any compensatingly fair convenience to the other party, but where, on the contrary, the suit might more conveniently be litigated in another forum available equally to both parties.\n This doctrine of justice applies with especially compelling force where the conveniences to be balanced are not \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 58]\n\u00a0\n merely conveniences of conflicting private interests but where there is added the controlling factor of public interest. The so-called 'convenience' of a railroad concerns the important national function of which the railroads are the agency. As in other phases of federal railroad regulation, the interests of carriers, employees, and the public must be balanced. Because of the 'direct concern of the public' in maintaining an economic and efficient railroad system, a unanimous Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis, held that a carrier may not be sued by a plaintiff where, under the circumstances of the particular facts, such suit would impose an unfair burden upon railroads and thereby upon the nation. Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S.Ct. 556. The declaration by Congress that a court has jurisdiction and venue is not a command that it must exercise its authority in such a case to the unnecessary injury of a defendant and the public. This doctrine has been consistently followed in a series of unanimous decisions. Atchison, T . & S.F. Ry. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S.Ct. 469; Michigan Central v. Mix, \n278 \nU.S. 492\n, 49 S.Ct. 207; Hoffman v. State of Missouri ex rel. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S.Ct. 485; Denver & R.G.W.R. Co. v. Terte, \n284 \nU.S. 284\n, 52 S.Ct. 152.1 Of course, Congress if it chose, could subject interstate carriers to the jurisdiction of the state courts even in the situations in which this Court found that assumption of jurisdiction would be an injustice to the public. But Congress has not expressed a different view of the governing public interest-and these cases stand as unchallenged \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 59]\n\u00a0\n authorities that notwithstanding the provision of the Federal Employers' Liability Act conferring unqualified 'concurrent jurisdiction' upon the state courts, a plaintiff may in some circumstances be barred from bringing his suit in one of the places specified by the Act. In this respect, at least, a plaintiff's 'privilege of venue granted by the legislative body which created this right of action' can 'be frustrated for reasons of convenience or expense'.\n The opinion of the Court attaches importance to a phrase taken from Senator Borah's remarks on the floor of the Senate in submitting the bill to amend the Act: 'The bill enables the plaintiff to find the corporation at any point or place or State where it is actually carrying on business, and there lodge his action, if he chooses to do so.' 45 Cong.Rec. 4034. The context of this statement is set out in the footnote. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The intrinsic difficulties of language and the emergence, after enactment, of situations not anticipated by even the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 60]\n\u00a0\n most gifted legislative imagination reveal the doubts and ambiguities in statutes that so often compel judicial construction. To illumine these dark places in legislative composition all the sources of light must be drawn upon. But the various aids to construction are guides of experience, not technical rules of law. See Boston Sand Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n, 49 S.Ct. 52, 53. One of the sources which may be used for extracting meaning from legislation is the deliberative commentary of the legislators immediately in charge of a measure. Contemporary answers by those authorized to give answers to questions raised about the meaning of pending legislation obviously go a long way to elucidating doubtful legislative purpose. But this rule of good sense does not mean that every loose phrase even of the proponent of a measure is to be given the authority of an encyclical. The language of a chairman of a committee, like the language of all people, is merely a symbol of thought. A speaker's casual, isolated general observation should not be tortured into an expression of disregard for an established, far-reaching policy of the law. Especially in the case of Senator Borah such imputation should not be made. As is well known, he eyed most jealously the absorption of state authority by extension of federal power. It would have been easy to vest the enforcement of the Federal Employers' Liability Act entirely in the federal courts. Instead, not only was concurrent jurisdiction given to the state courts in the enforcement of this federal right but removal of a state action to the federal courts was prohibited. Instead of being deemed hostile to the purposes of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and not to be entrusted with its administration, the state courts were accepted as the most active agencies for its enforcement. And yet, although nowhere in the course of the whole legislative history of the Act in question-the hearings, the reports in both houses, the debates on the floor-is there the slightest intimation that the problem before us entered the mind of any legis- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 61]\n\u00a0\n lator, we are asked to attribute to Senator Borah the uprooting of a doctrine which is an old and fruitful part of the fabric of the law of the states as well as the law of the land, by a general observation which has no relation to this doctrine and to which respectful meaning can be given without such distortion.\n To read the venue provision of the Act as do the majority of the Court is to translate the permission given a plaintiff to enter courts previously closed to him into a withdrawal from the state courts of power historically exercised by them, and into an absolute direction to the specified federal and state courts to take jurisdiction. The implications of such a construction extend far beyond the situation we now have here of an attempt by a state court to enjoin an action brought in a federal court sitting in another state. It seems to be generally held that the grant to the state courts of jurisdiction concurrent with the federal courts does not deprive one state court of the power to enjoin an oppressive suit under the Act in a foreign state court. \n3\n Moreover, this Court has expressly held that the venue provision of the Employers' Liability Act does not prevent a state court from declining jurisdiction as a forum non conveniens. Douglas v. New York, New Haven & H.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S. Ct. 355. To be sure, under the guise of applying local doctrines of equity jurisdiction, a state court cannot defeat the proper assertion of a federal right. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 62]\n\u00a0\n Resort to this Court may always be had to lay bare such an unwarranted frustration. American Ry. Exp. Co. v. Levee, \n263 \nU.S. 19\n, 44 S.Ct. 11; Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22\n, 44 S.Ct. 13. But such supervisory power by this Court over the determination of federal rights by state courts does not imply the denial of power in the state courts to make such determinations in the first instance Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 57 S., 32 S.Ct. 169, 177, 178, 38 L.R.A., N.S., 44; Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S.; Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 637\n, 4 S.Ct. 544, 551; cf. Warren, Federal Criminal Laws and State Courts, 38 Harv.L.Rev. 545, 596, 597. The long history of leaving the effective enforcement of federal rights to state courts has proceeded on recognition of the power of the state courts to exercise in the first instance their settled doctrines of law and equity. The opinion of the Court ignores these settled principles. In an area demanding the utmost judicial circumspection, dislocating uncertainty is thereby introduced.\n If the privilege afforded a plaintiff to bring suit under the Employers' Liability Act in one place rather than in another is to be regarded as an absolute command to the federal courts to take jurisdiction regardless of any considerations of justice and fairness, why is not the same effect to be given the comparable general venue provisions of  51 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  112, 28 U.S.C.A.  112? Nothing in the language or the history of the venue provision of the Act differentiates it from the numerous other venue provisions of the Judicial Code. Is the settled doctrine of forum non conveniens to be deemed impliedly repealed by every such venue provision? Surely it is much more consonant with reason and right to read venue provisions in the familiar context of established law rather than to impute to Congress an unconsidered, profound alteration in the relationship between the federal and the state \n\n[314 \nU.S. 44, 63]\n\u00a0\n courts and in the relations of the federal courts inter se. Cf. Gay v. Ruff, \n292 \nU.S. 25\n, 54 S.Ct. 608, 92 A.L.R. 970.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Jud.Code,  237(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] McConnell v.

Columbia Co., \n292 \nU.S. 511\n, 54 S.Ct. 797, did not restrict but expressly recognized the doctrine of the Davis case. In finding the scope of the Davis doctrine in the circumstances which gave rise to it, the opinion in the Milling Co. case only followed traditional technique in the use of precedents. It made precisely the same differentiation that Mr. Justice Brandeis, who articulated the doctrine in the Davis case, made in applying the principle of the case to subsequent situations. See State of Missouri ex rel. St. Louis, B. & M. Ry. v. Taylor, \n266 \nU.S. 200\n, 45 S.Ct. 47, and Hoffman v. State of Missouri ex rel. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S.Ct. 485. The doctrine itself stands unchallenged. The present decision does not challenge it. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Mr. President, I wish to discuss very briefly the bill. The bill as it is now pending provides for three amendments to the employers' liability law which is now upon the statute books. The first has reference to the venue. ... The objection which has been made to the existing law, and this objection arises by reason of the decision of some of the courts, is that the plaintiff may sometimes be compelled to go a great distance in order to have his cause of action against the defendant by reason of the fact that now the action must be brought in certain instances in the district in which the defendant is an inhabitant. In other words, the corporation being an inhabitant of the State which creates it, it might follow that the plaintiff would have to travel a long distance in order, under certain conditions, to bring his action against the defendant and come within the terms of the law. So, if this bill should be passed the law will be remedied in that respect, in enabling the plaintiff to bring his action where the cause of action arose or where the defendant may be doing business. The bill enables the plaintiff to find the corporation at any point or place or State where it is actually carrying on business, and there lodge his action, if he chooses to do so.' 45 Cong.Rec. 4034. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Reed's Adm'x v.

DeLacy, of Omaha, Neb., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether respondent, plaintiff in the district court below, has established a cause of action in equity entitling it to a decree enjoining petitioners, the Attorney General of Nebraska and other state officers from prosecuting respondent's agents and officers in the state courts for criminal violations of the Nebraska Full Train Crew Law,  74-519, Comp.Stat. of Nebraska, 1929\n\n\n The statute makes it unlawful for any railroad in Nebraska to operate any passenger train of more than five cars 'with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman'. Passenger trains of five cars or less are required to be operated with a like crew, except that only 'one brakeman or flagman' is required instead of the one brakeman and one flagman required in the case of trains of more than five cars. By  74-522, officers or agents of railroads dispatching trains in violation of the statute are guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for each offense and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n the railroad is made liable for any damage caused by violations.\n Respondent's bill of complaint invoked the jurisdiction of the district court on grounds of diversity of citizenship. The facts alleged, so far as now material, are as follows. Respondent operates two trains in Nebraska, on which it assigns for the performance of the duties of a brakeman or flagman required by the statute, colored employees who are fully qualified to perform and to perform those duties, but who are designated as 'brakemen-porters' and paid lower wages than are respondent's white 'brakemen'.\n On complaint lodged with the State Railway Commission by an officer of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, it was alleged that respondent violated the statute, by employing brakemen-porters to perform the services of brakemen or flagmen. The Commission twice dismissed the complaint, but upon rehearing it ruled that although respondent's brakemen- porters, in addition to the duties of brakemen, when performance of such duties permit, render some services as porters, they competently perform the duties to which they are assigned, namely those of brakemen or flagmen, and that respondent's trains, so far as the public safety is concerned, are adequately manned. The Commission declined to pass upon the question whether their employment in the manner alleged complied with the Full Train Crew Law of the state and ordered that the records in the case be made available to the state attorney general for his use, if so advised, in prosecuting respondent for violation of any criminal statute of the state.\n The bill of complaint also alleges that employment of white brakemen for the services now performed by respondent's brakemen-porters will compel it to pay an increase of wages in excess of the jurisdictional amount, and that as each train movement involves an alleged vio- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n lation of the statute, numerous prosecutions for violations, which petitioners threaten, will result in imposing on respondent the burden of many litigations in the state criminal courts. Such prosecutions, if successful, it is alleged, will result in the imposition of aggregate fines in excess of $1,000,000 a year. The relief prayed is that the threatened prosecutions be declared to be unauthorized by the statute, and that petitioners be enjoined from interfering with the operation of respondent's trains through criminal prosecution or otherwise.\n After denial by the district court of petitioners' motion to dismiss the bill of complaint for want of equity, petitioners answered denying among others the allegations that respondent is threatened with multiplicity of criminal suits or that petitioners intended to proceed with prosecutions for violation of the statute, except as specifically stated in the answer. The answer sets up affirmatively that the attorney general has under consideration the question of respondent's compliance with the statute, and in the event that he should determine that it is 'necessary and proper to do so' in order to obtain a judicial determination of the question, he would cause a single test suit to be instituted in the state courts for some one alleged violation of the act by respondent, so conducted as to cause a minimum of financial expense to respondent and without seeking to inflict financial penalties or loss on respondent prior to a final determination of the suit in the state courts.\n The district court, without trial of any issue of fact, gave its decree for respondent, on the pleadings, for an injunction as prayed. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 108 F.2d 897. We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 623\n, 61 S.Ct. 8, 85 L.Ed. --, October 14, 1940, on a petition which challenged the equity jurisdiction of the district court to enjoin, in the circumstances, a criminal proceeding in the state courts, the question being of public importance since it \n\n[312 \nU.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n involves the appropriate relationship of the federal to the state courts.\n The court of appeals, construing the statute, held that the crews on respondent's trains conform to the statutory requirements; that criminal prosecution of respondent's officers is unauthorized by the Act and unlawful. It supported the exercise of the equity powers of the court to restrain the prosecutions on the ground that the attempted enforcement of the statute as construed by petitioners would subject respondent to a multiplicity of such prosecutions and to the risk, if petitioners' construction of the statute should be sustained, that fines or penalties aggregating a large amount would be imposed.\n It is a familiar rule that courts of equity do not ordinarily restrain criminal prosecutions. In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 211\n, 8 S.Ct. 482, 488; Davis & Farnum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 \nU.S. 207\n, 23 S.Ct. 498; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 500\n, 45 S.Ct. 141. No citizen or member of the community is immune from prosecution, in good faith, for his alleged criminal acts. The imminence of such a prosecution even though alleged to be unauthorized and hence unlawful is not alone ground for relief in equity which exerts its extraordinary powers only to prevent irreparable injury to the plaintiff who seeks its aid. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S.Ct. 15, 17; Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 143\n, 44 S.Ct. 257, 258; Tyson & Bro. v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 428\n, 47 S.Ct. 426, 427, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., \n274 \nU.S. 445, 452\n, 47 S.Ct. 681, 682.\n This is especially the case where the only threatened action is the prosecution in the state courts by state officers of an alleged violation of state law, with the resulting final and authoritative determination of the disputed question whether the act complained of is lawful or unlawful. Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 \nU.S. 148\n, 19 S.Ct. 119; Spielman Motor Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 55 S.Ct. 678, 680. The federal courts are without jurisdiction to try alleged \n\n[312 \nU.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n criminal violations of state statutes. The state courts are the final arbiters of their meaning and appropriate application, subject only to review by this Court if such construction or application is appropriately challenged on constitutional grounds. Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, supra; Fenner v. Boykin, \n271 \nU.S. 240\n, 46 S.Ct. 492.\n Hence interference with the processes of the criminal law in state courts, in whose control they are lodged by the Constitution, and the determination of questions of criminal liability under state law by federal courts of equity can be justified only in most exceptional circumstances, and upon clear showing that an injunction is necessary in order to prevent irreparable injury. Cf. Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, supra; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., supra; Spielman Motor Co. v. Dodge, supra. And in the exercise of the sound discretion, which guides the determination of courts of equity, scrupulous regard must be had for the rightful independence of state governments and a remedy infringing that independence which might otherwise be given should be withheld if sought on slight or inconsequential grounds. Di Giovanni v. Camden Insurance Association, \n296 \nU.S. 64, 73\n, 56 S.Ct. 1, 5, and cases cited.\n Here the court below found danger of irreparable injury in the threatened multiplicity of prosecutions and risk that the aggregate fines which might be imposed would be very large. But whether more than one criminal prosecution is threatened was by the pleadings made an issue of fact which the district court did not resolve. If it had found after a hearing, as the answer alleges, that only a single suit is contemplated, we could not say that any such irreparable injury is threatened as would justify staying the prosecution and withdrawing the determination of the legal question from the state courts, whose appointed function is to decide it. Boise Artesian \n\n[312 \nU.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n Water Co. v. Boise City, \n213 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 29 S.ct. 426, 430; Spielman Motor Co. v. Dodge, supra, \n295 \nU.S. 96\n, 55 S.Ct. 681.\n If its decision should be favorable to respondent no reason is shown for anticipating further prosecutions. If it were adverse, penalties in large amount, it is true, might be incurred, but they may well be the consequence of violations of state law. No question is here presented of the constitutional validity of the statute because the penalties which it inflicts are so great as to prevent recourse to the courts for the adjudication of respondent's rights under it. See Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 144\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 447, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Tucker, \n230 \nU.S. 340, 349\n, 33 S.Ct. 961, 963.\n It does not appear that any motion was made by the parties for judgment on the pleadings. But the record shows that the trial court entered the decree in respondent's favor on its own motion. Upon such a motion denials and allegations of the answer which are well pleaded must be taken as true. So taken the decree for respondent cannot be sustained and must be reversed. The majority of the Court are of opinion1 that in view of the state of the record and certain concessions made by counsel on the argument here any further hearing of the issue of irreparable injury to respondent from a threatened multiplicity of suits has been waived. The reversal will accordingly be with instructions to the district court to dismiss the bill of complaint. It is so ordered.\n Reversed with instructions. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice STONE are of opinion that the case should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBENITEZ SAMPAYO v. BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA(1941)\nNo. 90\nArgued: Decided: May 12, 1941\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Oct. 13, 1941\n\n\n Messrs. F. B. Fornaris, of Ponce, P.R., and Elmer McClain, of Lima, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Henri Brown and Walter L. Newsom, Jr., both of San Juan, P.R., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n To arrange a composition or an extension as a farmer-debtor, petitioner filed a petition in October, 1938, under  75 of the Bankruptcy Act, 47 Stat. 1467, 1470, as amended 48 Stat. 925; Id., 1289, 49 Stat. 246, Id., 942, 11 U.S.C.A.  203. Failing to secure the assents required by  75, sub. g, petitioner amended her petition in November, 1938, to proceed under  75, sub. s. Respondent then moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioner was not a 'farmer' and therefore was not entitled to the relief \n\n[313 \nU.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n afforded by  75, sub. s. After a hearing, the District Court sustained the motion.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that the formula for determining whether petitioner was a farmer was to be found in  1(17) of the Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840, 841, and that petitioner could not be regarded as a farmer within its terms. 1 Cir., 109 F.2d 743, on rehearing, 109 F.2d 750. Because the decision was substantially inconsistent with Order 50(9) of the General Orders in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S. C.A. following section 53, \n305 \nU.S. 677, 710\n, 59 S.Ct. clxxvii, we granted certiorari. \n1\n\u00a0\n311 \nU.S. 623\n, 61 S.Ct. 10, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The ultimate question, of course, is whether petitioner may proceed under  75, sub.  as a farmer-debtor, but for present purposes the problem is to select the definition of 'farmer' which is applicable to persons petitioning for relief under  75.\n The Bankruptcy Act contains two definitions of the term 'farmer'. Section 1(17) of the Chandler revision provides: \"Farmer' shall mean an individual personally engaged in farming or tillage of the soil, and shall include an individual personally engaged in dairy farming or in the productions of poultry, livestock, or poultry or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, if the principal part of his income is derived from any one or more of uch operations.'\n Section 75, sub. r, as amended in 1935, 49 Stat. 246, provides: 'For the purposes of this section, section 4(b), and section 74, the term 'farmer' includes not only an individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in producing products of the soil, but also any individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in dairy farming, the production of poultry or livestock, or the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n production of poultry products or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, or the principal part of whose income is derived from any one or more of the foregoing operations, and includes the personal representative of a deceased farmer ....'\n Starting with the premise that only one of the definitions can stand, respondent contends that  1(17) is an implicit repeal of  75, sub. r. To support the contention, respondent points to the obsolete reference in  75, sub. r to  74, 11 U.S.C.A.  202, and to a statement in a committee report which is said to indicate that Congress intended the definition in  1(17) to measure the applicability of  4, sub. b, 11 U.S.C.A.  22, sub. b, to persons who claim to be farmers. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The argument ignores the plain import of  75, sub. r. The meaning of the phrase 'for the purposes of this section' is hardly open to question. Obviously, it is neither impossible nor necessarily inconsistent to prescribe one definition for a particular section or sections and another for the balance of the Act. Nor is the applicability of  75, sub. r to proceedings under  75 seriously placed in doubt because the former section refers to a section which no longer exists under that number and to a section which now may be governed by  1(17). The only question here is whether  75, sub. r or  1(17) is applicable to  75.\n Section 75, with immaterial differences, first appeared in the distressed-debtor legislation of 1933. 47 Stat. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n 1467, 1470-1473. Designed for a particular purpose, the relief of hard- pressed farmers, it was regarded as a special and temporary enactment. See  75, sub. c; compare S.Rep. No. 1215, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3; H.Rep. No. 1898, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2. In 1938 its time limit was extended to 1940. 52 Stat. 84, 85, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, sub. (c). At that time a special committee held extensive hearings on a proposal to make  75 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Act, and finally concluded that the section should be continued only as temporary legislation. Hearings before Special Subcommittee on Bankruptcy of the Committee on the Judiciary, 75th Congress, 2d and 3d Sessions; see also H.Rep. No. 1833, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2; S.Rep. No. 899, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; H.Rep. No. 1658, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2. Naturally enough, legislation drafted for such a purpose carried its own test for determining the persons to whom it should apply.\n When the proposed revision of 1938 was before a Senate Committee, Representative Chandler, the proponent of the bill stated: 'We did not touch ( 75) and it is not affected by this Act.' Discussing the alterations in existing statutes worked by the new act, the House Report laconically observed that there was 'no change' in  75. H.Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 144. Somewhat less briefly, the Senate Report stated: 'Section 75 relates to agricultural compositions and extensions. These expire by limitation and are, therefore, not covered by the bill.' S. Rep. No. 1916, 75 Cong., 3d Sess., p. 18.\n The Chandler Act, a careful and comprehensive revision of bankruptcy legislation, was the product of several years of thoughtful study. See 81 Cong.Rec. 8646-8649. One of its avowed purposes was to clarify or remove inconsistent and overlapping provisions. See H.Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-3. As a part of this comprehensive revision, numerous definitions were \n\n[313 \nU.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n overhauled or inserted for the first time. Among the latter was  1(17). See H.Rep. No. 1409, supra, p. 6. But  75, sub. r also was left in the Act, and, as already indicated, its existence was not unknown to the revisors. Its very presence in the statute after the revision is persuasive evidence that  1(17) was not intended to govern proceedings under  75.\n We conclude that petitioner's activities must be tested by the definition in  75, sub. r rather than by the one in  1(17). The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of other questions in light of our decision.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Insofar as material here, Order 50(9) reads: '... The petition shall show to the satisfaction of the district court that the decedent at the time of his death was a farmer within the meaning of subdivision (r) of section 75 ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The latter argument, upon which we express no opinion, is grounded on the statement in H.Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6, which runs: 'The amendment of May 5 (sic), 1935 ... extends the meaning of the term 'farmer'. ... Correspondingly, section 4 of the act is amended by substituting the phrase 'a farmer' for the language 'a person engaged chiefly in farming or the tillage of the soil'. Pursuant to this purpose of Congress to expand the meaning of the term, it would seem advisable to formulate a new definition and to include it in section 1 as clause (17).' \n\n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERNARDS v. JOHNSON(1941)\n\nArgued: October 14, 1941Decided: November 10, 1941\n\n\n\n Motion to Recall Mandate Denied Mar. 2, 1942\n\n\n See -- U.S. --, 62 S.Ct. 792, 86 L.Ed. --. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 20]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Lemke, of Fargo, N.D., and Martin J. Bernards, pro se, for petitioners.\n Messrs. William L. Brewster and H. G. Platt, both of Portland, Or., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We took this case because it presents important questions of appellate practice under  751 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n The petitioners, who are adjudicated bankrupts, attack an order and a decree of the District Court, which were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 The respondents are mortgagees who purchased property of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n bankrupts at foreclosure sales, and the trustee in bankruptcy.\n The petitioners were owners of land in Oregon. April 12, 1933, the respondent, Collins brought foreclosure proceedings on a mortgage which was a first lien on a portion of the land. April 6, 1934, two of the respondents, Johnson and United States National Bank (herein, for the sake of brevity, referred to as Johnson) instituted a foreclosure suit under a mortgage which was secured by a pledge of personalty and was also a first lien on all the land not covered by the Collins mortgage, and a second lien on the tract mortgaged to Collins. July 11, 1934, a state court entered a decree of foreclosure in the latter suit.\n August 10, 1934, the petitioners jointly applied to the District Court, as farmers, for composition or extension of their indebtedness. On the same day the court restrained, until further order, any sale under the Johnson mortgage, and referred the cause to a conciliation commissioner. That officer having reported, on the reference and on a re-reference, failure to agree on a composition or extension, the petitioners, December 19, 1934, reciting the failure and their desire to have the benefits of the bankruptcy act, and particularly of subsection  of  75 as it then stood,3 prayed that 'they and each of them be adjudged by this court to be bankrupts, within the purview of said Acts of Congress.' An adjudication as to each petitioner was entered, and, December 20, 1934, the case was referred to a referee.\n February 8, 1935, the bankrupts petitioned for the appointment of appraisers and to be allowed to retain possession of their property, as provided in subsection s.\n February 18, 1935, the restraining order of August 10, 1934, was vacated as superfluous, inasmuch as subdivi- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n sions a to r of  75 are self-executing. \n4\n May 21, 1935, appraisers were appointed. May 27, 1935, this court held subsection  unconstitutional. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n June 28, 1935, the petitioners applied for a re-reference of their original petition for composition or extension to a conciliation commissioner. The application was denied by the court on the ground that they had been adjudged bankrupts and that their bankruptcy proceeding was then pending before a referee. No appeal was taken.\n June 29, 1935, Johnson purchased the mortgaged realty and the pledged personalty at a sale in the Johnson foreclosure suit, held pursuant to order of the state court, and the sale was confirmed July 20, 1935. The petitioners appeared and opposed confirmation, but did not appeal from the decree.\n August 26, 1935, a sale was made to Collins pursuant to a foreclosure decree entered by the state court, July 9, 1935, under the Collins mortgage, and the sale was confirmed September 16, 1935.\n A new subsection s, to replace that held unconstitutional, having been adopted August 28, 1935,6 the petitioners, September 30, 1935, reciting their adjudication as bankrupts and the reference of the case to a referee, and, relying on the newly adopted subsection s, which authorizes conciliation commissioners to act as referees in  75 cases subsequent to adjudication, moved the court to recall the proceedings from the referee. By order of even date the prior reference was recalled, and the referee was directed to remit the record to the court. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n Although under the Oregon law a purchaser at foreclosure sale is entitled to possession of the land from the day of sale,7 the debtors remained in possession. To oust them Johnson applied to the state court for a writ of assistance. October 3, 1935, the bankruptcy court, at petitioners' instance, temporarily restrained the sheriff from executing any such writ.\n By order of October 15, 1935, the court, reciting the adjudication of December 19, 1934, referred the bankruptcy case to a conciliation commissioner.\n December 18, 1935, the court dissolved the temporary restraining order against the sheriff, for the reasons that the property had been sold pursuant to an execution in the Johnson foreclosure and the sale duly confirmed; that, when these steps were taken, the state court had jurisdiction acquired prior to the commencement of the proceedings under  75; and that the execution of the writ of assistance would not, therefore, interfere with any property of the bankrupt. No appeal was taken from the order, the writ of assistance issued, and the petitioners were dispossessed January 25, 1936.\n The period of redemption from the sale in the Johnson foreclosure expired June 29, 1936, and, on July 1, a sheriff's deed was delivered.\n July 15, 1936, the bankrupts filed with the conciliation commissioner a petition reciting the institution of the extension proceeding, its futility, the consequent adjudication of bankruptcy, the sheriff's sale under the Johnson mortgage, and its confirmation. They alleged that they were farmers within  75 as amended August 28, 1935, and were, under the terms of the statute, entitled to the possession of the mortgaged property and its proceeds; that Johnson was endeavoring to exercise control of and ex- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n clude them from the property. They prayed an order granting them immediate possession, control, and management of the real estate, and restraining the sheriff, Johnson, and Collins, 'from transferring without purchase of said property in accordance with the Frazer-Lemke Act as amended' (sic); and for a further order 'specifically extending the period of redemption as provided' in the Act.\n Johnson filed an answer and cross-petition which is not included in the transcript of record certified to this court. The debtors replied asking that the answer be dismissed; that they be accorded the full benefits of the Act, that the sheriff's deed be cancelled, and that Johnson be required to account for all crops harvested and property removed from the land.\n August 8, 1936, the commissioner found that the bankrupts had never petitioned under the new subsection  for appraisal, the setting aside of their exempt property, and for possession of their property under the control of the court; that appraisers had never been appointed or the property appraised; that no order in respect of exemptions or for possession by the bankrupts had ever been made; that no stay order had been entered; that no rental had ever been fixed; that no order of any sort had been made under the amended subsection except the orders recalling the proceedings from the referee and referring them to the commissioner; that the bankrupts are not farmers within the definition of the Act; that on August 28, 1935, when the new subsection  took effect, they had only an equity of redemption in the lands, except for the tract covered by the Collins mortgage; and that the new subsection  was unconstitutional. He entered a decree to the effect that since June 29, 1935, the date of the foreclosure sale, the bankruptcy court had had no jurisdiction of the land then sold; that the new subsection  had no application to any of the land sold in fore- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n closure; that the bankrupts were not farmers within the meaning of the Act, and were not entitled to the benefits of the Act; that their petition should be denied; and that a trustee should be appointed to liquidate the estate.\n The time fixed by standing rule of the District Court for petitioning for a review of a referee's order in bankruptcy is twenty days. No application was made within that time to have the order reviewed.\n August 29, 1936, the creditors elected, and the commissioner thereupon appointed, the respondent, Loomis, trustee and, September 3, the commissioner entered an order approving his bond.\n September 10, 1936, the year for redemption from the sale in the Collins foreclosure having expired, the sheriff delivered his deed to Collins as purchaser.\n September 19, 1936, the bankrupts filed with the commissioner a 'notice of appeal' from the orders of August 29 and September 3. Treating the notice as a petition for review, the commissioner filed his certificate with the District Court.\n Meantime administration of the estate proceeded as in ordinary bankruptcy and appraisers were appointed September 25, 1936. October 23 they filed an appraisement of the property of the bankrupts, not including that which had been sold in foreclosure.\n December 15, 1936, the District Court entered a decree confirming the commissioner's orders of August 29 and September 3. No appeal was taken.\n January 4, 1937, the bankrupts filed with the commissioner a petition reciting their adjudication as bankrupts, and praying that the commissioner proceed with the appraisal of their property; that he rescind the order of August 8, 1936; that he remove the trustee because the latter was not elected by the requisite majority in amount of unsecured creditors, and was an improper person; that the trustee be ordered to account for all property coming \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n into his possession; and that the bankrupt's exemptions be set aside to them. They asked for other specific relief not necessary to detail, and for general relief. January 11, 1937, the commissioner ordered the petition dismissed, 'for the reason that all matters and things in said petition alleged have heretofore been considered upon petition filed by said bankrupts and decided adversely to said bankrupts, and said orders have all become final and conclusive.'\n January 13, 1937, the bankrupts filed in the District Court a petition for an order restraining the trustee from selling the personal property of the estate. The petition was denied two days later. No appeal was taken.\n January 15, 1937, they filed in the District Court a petition wherein, after praying that all the files in the case be incorporated by reference, they set out in summary a history of the proceeding from the filing of the original petition for extension or composition, attacked many of the orders theretofore made, prayed that their failure to seek a review of the order of the commissioner of August 8, 1936, within the time limited for that purpose be excused; that the court review the entire proceeding, reverse all previous orders of the commissioner, and hold the petitioners farmers entitled to the benefits of the Act; that the court treat the petition 'as exceptions to said decisions of the commissioner', and grant the petitioners appropriate relief, and, meantime, restrain the trustee from selling any personal property of the estate.\n January 29, 1937, they filed with the court a petition for review of the commissioner's order of January 11, 1937, dismissing their petition of January 4, 1937.\n To the petition of January 15, 1937, Johnson and Collins filed answers reciting the various steps in the proceeding and the orders made by the commissioner and the court as to which there had been no review or appeal, and alleging that all the issues raised in the petition had \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 27]\n\u00a0\n consequently been finally adjudicated against the petitioners.\n In addition each answer recited the proceedings in the state court as they are above outlined, and asserted that as a result of those proceedings each respondent had acquired title and possession, and that the bankrupt, Bernards, was interfering with that possession, and prayed that their title might be quieted. The trustee in bankruptcy also filed an answer setting up the finality of the unappealed and unreviewed orders in the cause and praying certain relief.\n April 13, 1938, the bankrupts filed in the court a motion to vacate and set aside 'all orders of this Court, and of all the Referees and Conciliation Commissioners where it was sought to set aside or delay the carrying out of any of the provisions of the Bankrupt Act' and to reinstate the cause. The grounds assigned were to the effect that the court, the referee and conciliation commissioner had failed to comply with the Act.\n The District Court held a single hearing upon the petition of January 15, 1937, the petition for review of January 29, 1937, and the motion of April 13, 1938. The bankrupts admitted the truth of the facts set up by the respondents in their cross-petitions, but not their legal effect. As all the facts were of record or admitted no testimony was taken.\n May 10, 1938, the court affirmed the commissioner's order of January 11, 1937. Upon the petition of January 15, 1937, and the motion of April 13, 1938, the court made findings of fact and stated conclusions of law which were embodied in the order and decree entered. This dismissed the petition and denied the motion, quieted the title of the mortgage-creditor respondents as against the bankrupts to the lands purchased by them at foreclosure sale, ratified and approved the orders of the commissioner, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 28]\n\u00a0\n and in effect directed that the cause proceed as an ordinary bankruptcy and not under  75, sub. s.\n In its findings the court details the history of the proceeding and recites the order of the court of December 18, 1935, the order of the commissioner of August 8, 1936, the order of the court of December 15, 1936, affirming the commissioner's orders of August 29 and September 3, 1936, and finds with respect to each that no review was prayed or appeal taken within the time limited by rule or by law and that each of them had become final.\n The bankrupts took one appeal from the order affirming on review the commissioner's order of January 11, 1937, and the order and decree dismissing their petition of January 13, 1937, and their motion of April 13, 1938, and granting the relief asked by the respondents.\n May 2, 1939, the Circuit Court of Appeals, 9 Cir., 103 F.2d 567, affirmed both orders. May 25, 1939, that court stayed its mandate until July 15, and, directed that if a petition to this court for certiorari should be docketed by that date, the mandate should be stayed until after we had passed upon the petition.\n A petition for certiorari was docketed July 10, 1939, and was denied October 23, \n308 \nU.S. 595\n, 60 S.Ct. 127. The mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals issued October 28. A motion made November 4, to recall the mandate and hold it pending our decision in John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Bartels, \n308 \nU.S. 180\n, 60 S.Ct. 221, was denied November 6. The Bartels case was decided December 4, 1939. January 2, 1940, the petitioners presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals a motion 'for recall and correction, amendment, revision or opening and vacating mandate and judgment entered thereon', upon the ground that the court's decision was contrary to ours in the Bartels case.\n January 2, 1940, this court decided Kalb v. Feuerstein, \n308 \nU.S. 433\n, 60 S.Ct. 343, and, January 18, the bankrupts supplemented their pending motion, alleging that our decision \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 29]\n\u00a0\n was in conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the instant case.\n March 22, 1940, the Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motion and, April 12, the bankrupts again petitioned for certiorari asserting that the court had disregarded our two decisions in holding that the bankrupts' inability to rehabilitate themselves was a relevant factor in appraising their right to resort to  75, sub.  and in holding further that the automatic stay created by subsection o did not survive adjudication under subsection s, and had refused, although it had the power, to recall its mandate so as to correct its erroneous construction of the Act. We granted certiorari April 29, 1940, \n310 \nU.S. 616\n, 60 S.Ct. 899.\n Three questions emerge from this long and complicated record. They are:\n\n 1. \nAssuming the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was erroneous, had it power to recall its mandate and reconsider the appeal? We hold that it had.\n\n 2. \nAssuming the challenged orders of the commissioner and the court were erroneous, were they final, binding, and impregnable to subsequent attack, since review or appeal was not sought or taken within the time limited by court rule or by law? We hold that they were.\n\n 3. \nHad the state court jurisdiction to proceed with foreclosure and to invest the mortgage creditors, as purchasers at the execution sales, with valid title to the mortgaged lands? We hold that it had.\n First. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was rendered in its October 1938 Term. The stay of the mandate did not end, and the mandate was not issued, until that term had expired. The application for recall of the mandate was presented within the following term, during which the mandate had gone down. The respondents assert that the court lacked authority, after the term in which its judgment was rendered, to recall its mandate and to amend its judgment in matter of substance. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 30]\n\u00a0\n In granting the stay the Circuit Court of Appeals might have extended the term so that it could further consider the case after this court had acted on the petition for certiorari. We think that, by staying the issue of the mandate and retaining the cause until after the subsequent term had opened, the court, in effect, did extend the term as respects the instant case and that, upon disposition of the petition for certiorari, it had power to take further steps in the cause during the term in which the stay expired and the mandate issued.\n Second. The District Court disposed of three distinct matters in the orders under review: The petition for review of the commissioner's orders of January 11, 1937, the petition of January 15, 1937, and the motion of April 13, 1938.\n The court dismissed the petition for review. The commissioner had denied the petition of January 4, 1937, on the sole ground 'that all the matters and things set out in said petition have been previously adjudicated and no review thereof has been had, or if review was taken, such actions of the Referee have been approved on review', and that 'all matters and things in said petition alleged have heretofore been considered upon petition filed by said bankrupts and decided adversely to said bankrupts, and said orders have all become final and conclusive.' The order affirming the action of the commissioner did not deal with the merits. The court clearly affirmed the commissioner's refusal to consider the petition for the reason stated by him.\n In dismissing the petition of January 15, 1937, and the motion of April 13, 1938, the court made findings of fact and stated conclusions of law covering both. It entered what it denominated an 'order and decree' with respect to both, and, as above noted, dismissed both the petition and the motion, on the stated ground that all issues therein \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 31]\n\u00a0\n raised had been finally adjudicated and no review or appeal had been timely sought or taken.\n If the respondents had not cross-petitioned for affirmative relief, the District Court need have taken no further action than it did in dismissing the bankrupts' petition and motion. An order denying a petition for rehearing or review which is dismissed because the petition was filed out of time, without reconsideration of the merits, does not extend the time for appeal from the original order. \n8\n But there remained for disposition the prayers of the respondents for affirmative relief. The additional provisions of the decree were in answer to these prayers. As those provisions were assigned as error, the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review them.\n Upon the admission of counsel for the bankrupts, the District Court found the facts as to the foreclosure proceedings and found that they were before a court having jurisdiction; that the titles acquired through the execution sales were good as against the bankrupts, and quieted the titles of the mortgagees as purchasers. With respect to the relief and the instructions prayed by the trustee, the court made certain findings as to what had been done in the administration of the estate, confirmed that action, and instructed the trustee as to his further proceedings. These findings and these provisions of the decree obviously were made in response to the cross-petitions of the respondents. They cannot be considered as a review of the merits requested by the petitioners.\n The court also found that the bankrupts had made no attempt to comply with the new subsection  of  75; that they had, ever since the filing of their petition for adjudication on December 19, 1934, been beyond all hope of financial rehabilitation; that there was no possibility of such rehabilitation. Such findings constitute no basis \n\n[314 \nU.S. 19, 32]\n\u00a0\n either for a refusal to adjudicate the farmer-petitioner a bankrupt under  75, sub.  or for dismissing the cause instead of following the procedure outlined in the subsection. \n9\n In the instant case, however, these findings, though evidently directed to the relief prayed by the respondents, were not necessary to the decision of any of the questions they submitted to the court and do not render erroneous the proper disposition of the issues submitted.\n Third. The petitioners urge that the automatic stay imposed by subsection o, and the extension of the period of redemption created by subsection n, continued throughout the case and that all action taken in the state court was, therefore, void under the doctrine announced in Kalb v. Feuerstein, supra. The respondents insist that, in order to continue the extension and have the benefit of the stay after the conclusion of the conciliation proceedings and the adjudication in bankruptcy, timely application to the bankruptcy court to that end had to be made by the petitioners. We find it unnecessary to discuss or decide the important question thus mooted, for the reason that the orders and decrees entered by the bankruptcy court, if valid, relieved the respondents, as mortgagees, of any disability to pursue their foreclosure suits arising out of the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding and left them free to prosecute the foreclosures in the state courts. However erroneous the challenged orders, the remedy for their correction was by timely application for review or timely appeal. \n10\n Since the District Court refused to review these orders and decrees out of time, the petitioners could not attack them in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11 U.S.C.  203, 11 U.S.C.A.  203. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 9 Cir., 103 F.2d 567. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The subsection was added to  75 by the Act of June 28, 1934, 48 Stat. 1289. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It appears from the record that this order was entered nunc pro tunc on August 31, 1938, the court reciting that, through inadvertence, the order was not entered when made, although shown on the clerk's notes, and within the recollection of the judge.

UNITED STATES(1941)\nNo. 336\nArgued: February 4, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 450, 451]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ernest W. Gibson, Jr., of Brattleboro, Vt., and C. L. Dawson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner sued the United States in a federal district court, alleging that he became totally and permanently disabled prior to December 1, 1919, while his policies of War Risk Insurance were in force and effect. 1 Trial was had and evidence heard. The trial judge declined to grant the government's request for a directed verdict in its favor. The jury found for petitioner. The government, without having made any motion either for a new trial or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Upon review that court held plaintiff had not produced sufficient evidence to justify submission of the cause to the jury. The court did not, however, remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings, but reversed the judgment and dismissed the cause of action. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petition for certiorari presented two questions: First, whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict; Second, whether the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the cause instead of remanding it for a new trial. This second question invoked our juris- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n diction in order to obtain an authoritative construction of subdivision (b) of Rule 50 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. In part that subdivision provides: 'Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Within 10 days after the reception of a verdict, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict; ....' Since the government made no such motion within 10 days after the verdict, petitioner urged here that the Circuit Court of Appeals was without power to dismiss the cause but should have remanded it for a new trial. But while this important point, upon which the Circuit Courts of Appeals are not in complete agreement, 3 is one of the two questions upon which the petition for certiorari rested, there is no occasion for us to reach it here. For we find that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict, and we hold that the District Court properly denied the government's motion for a directed verdict in its favor.\n Rule 50(b) goes further than the old practice4 in that district judges, under certain circumstances, are now expressly declared to have the right (but not the mandatory duty) to enter a judgment contrary to the jury's \n\n[312 \nU.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n without granting a new trial. \n5\n But that rule has not taken away from juries and given to judges any part of the exclusive power of juries to weigh evidence and determine contested issues of fact6-a jury being the constitutional tribunal provided for trying facts in courts of law. Here, although there was evidence from which a jury could have reached a contrary conclusion, there was testimony from which a jury could have found these to be the facts: Petitioner suffered injuries on June 16, 1918, while serving in the front lines in France. On that date, in the early morning hours, bits of shrapnel wounded him in the right arm, right shoulder, right hip and in front of the right ear. He was helped to a dugout by another soldier. There he found others who were wounded. About fifteen minutes after he arrived at the dugout, another shell struck, immediately in front of the dugout door. All the nine or ten men present were either killed outright or were so badly wounded that they were unable to leave. Petitioner's left leg was practically cut off below the knee. He twisted a part of his wrapped leggings around his wound to stop the bleeding. About six and one-half hours later he was taken on a stretcher and carried back to the First Aid Station. There his wounds were temporarily dressed. After another six or seven hours, he was carried to the hospital. Shortly thereafter an operation followed and his left leg was removed. He underwent several operations in the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n hospitals in France, leaving that country for the United States in August of 1918 and arriving in Boston on September 7. He was treated in hospitals in the United States until about Christmas, 1918. During the years between the time of the injury and the time of the trial, petitioner suffered repeatedly from abscesses and blisters on the stump of his left leg, and his right leg has caused him inconvenience, suffering and disability. In addition his nervous system has shown serious and continuous impairment, so much so that the Circuit Court of Appeals properly said, 'Certain it is that he was neurasthenic, and had uncontrollable accesses of terror at any explosion, or even during thunder-storms.' (111 F.2d 616.) There has never been a time since his injuries when he could do work which required him to stand upon or use the stump without having it blistered, chafed or abscessed within two days. Several physicians who examined and treated him through the years were of opinion that he would never be able to work continuously at a gainful occupation because of his condition, and that he had never been able so to work since the wound was received. The government gave him vocational training both in photography and in automobile repair work. He tried both, but from his own evidence, corroborated by that of his employers in many instances, the jury could have found that in spite of his determination to succeed, he was physically unable to do so. He bought a farm. He was compelled to depend on the work of his own family and relatives in this undertaking, but the venture was a failure and he lost the farm. He tried to operate a garage in partnership with another. In this, too, he was unsuccessful, and the jury could have found that his failure was attributable to his physical disabilities. For a time he was engaged as a salesman of aluminum cooking utensils. But here again the jury could have found that his contribution to the venture was small. For as else- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n where, there was testimony tending to show that it was a member of his family, in this instance his wife, whose labors made it possible for this activity to be carried on. Taking the evidence as a whole, the jurors, who heard the witnesses and personally examined the petitioner's wounds, could fairly have reached the conclusion that since his injuries petitioner never had been able, and would not be able thereafter, to work with any reasonable degree of regularity at any substantially gainful employment. The trial judge, who had the same opportunity as the jury to hear the witnesses, denied the government's motion for a directed verdict and correctly instructed the jury what they must find from the evidence in order to return a verdict for petitioner. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It was not necessary that petitioner be bed-ridden, wholly helpless, or that he should abandon every possible effort to work in order for the jury to find that he was totally and permanently disabled. \n8\n It cannot be doubted that if petitioner had refrained from trying to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 450, 456]\n\u00a0\n do any work at all, and the same evidence of physical impairment which appears in this record had been offered, a jury could have properly found him totally and permanently disabled. And the jury could have found that his efforts to work-all of which sooner or later resulted in failure-were made not because of his ability to work but because of his unwillingness to live a life of idleness, even though totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of his policies. \n9\n Nor does the fact that he waited thirteen years before bringing suit stand as an insuperable barrier to his recovery. His case was not barred by any statute of limitations. Whatever weight the jury should have given to the circumstance of petitioner's delay in filing his claim, that weight was still for their consideration in connection with all the other evidence in the case.\n There was evidence from which a jury could reach the conclusion that petitioner was totally and permanently disabled. That was enough. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Though petitioner alleged that his policies were in effect until December 1, 1919, in reality it was necessary for him to show that he became totally and permanently disabled prior to September 1, 1919. This variance in dates is not material, however. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 615. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Conway v.

The word 'total' as applied to 'disability' does not necessarily mean incapacitated to do any work at all. The word 'continuously' means with reasonable regularity. It does not preclude periods of disability which are ordinarily incident to activities of persons in generally sound health, for nearly all persons are at times temporarily incapacitated by injuries, or poor health, from carrying on their occupations. If Berry was able to follow a gainful occupation only spasmodically, with frequent interruptions, due to his injuries, and his shock, he was totally disabled. A disability is permanent when it is of such a nature that it is reasonably certain it will continue throughout a person's lifetime.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Lumbra v.

OF NEW JERSEY(1941)\nNo. 384\nArgued: January 17, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Fred B. Gernerd, of Allentown, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry B. Friedman, of Allentown, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certiorari brings here the question as to whether the law of Pennsylvania limits recovery under the provisions of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, 45 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., to the procedure and awards of that state's Workmen's Compensation Act, 77 P.S.Pa.  1 et seq., in accidents where the railway employee is engaged in an intrastate activity at the time of injury.\n The suit was brought at common law in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The employee, petitioner here, was a citizen of Pennsylvania and the defendant was a corporation created under the laws of New Jersey, handling transportation moving between states. The basis of the action was respondent's violation of the Safety Appliance Acts by failure to furnish efficient hand \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n brakes for a car. \n1\n This failure resulted in an injury to petitioner in Pennsylvania. No interstate commerce was involved. He recovered in the trial court but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on its determination that the remedy of the petitioner lay solely in the Compensation Act and was not cognizable at law. \n2\n We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict on a question of local law between the judgment below and Miller v. Reading Company. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n No issues arise except the one upon procedure. It is clear that an employee injured in intrastate transportation by defective equipment of an interstate railroad comes under the Safety Appliance Acts. \n4\n Nor is there any longer a question as to the power of the state to provide whatsoever remedy it may choose for breaches of the Safety Appliance Acts. \n5\n The federal statutes create the right; the remedy is within the state's discretion. In this case we are to find what remedy the State of Pennsylvania has provided.\n This Court had occasion to consider the matter of what remedies for breach of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts had been provided by a state in Tipton v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company. \n6\n The circumstances there were quite similar to the present case. Tipton was an employee of a railroad which was a highway of interstate commerce and suffered injury through violation of the safety acts while engaged within California in intrastate transpor- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n tation. He sought damages at common law and, after removal to the federal court, was cast in the litigation on the ground that his only redress lay through the California Workmen's Compensation Act, St.Cal.1917, p. 831. In affirming this conclusion here, two cases of the district courts of appeal of California were examined-Ballard v. Sacramento Northern Railway Company 7 and Walton v. Southern Pacific Company. \n8\n Petition for review of the two cases had been refused by the Supreme Court of California. \n9\n The Ballard case treated section 6 of the act of April 22, 1908,10 the jurisdictional section of the Federal Employers Liability Act, as applicable to the cause of action under consideration, although that cause was bottomed upon the Safety Appliance Acts. From that premise the California court went ahead to conclude that its Workmen's Compensation Act did not apply by virtue of section 69(c) of the Compensation Act. \n11\n That section omitted employments governed by the acts of Congress. The Compensation Act is the exclusive state remedy for injuries within its scope. The Federal Employers Liability Act does give a right of action and fix the tribunals where it may be \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n enforced. \n12\n Thus through assimilating the rights and remedies under the Safety Appliance Acts to those under the Federal Employers Liability Act, the California Workmen's Compensation Act was found inapplicable. Walton's was a similar case and it too, 8 Cal.App.2d at page 305, 48 P.2d 108, following Ballard, permitted the maintenance of the suit in the state court.\n This Court (\n298 \nU.S. 141\n, 56 S.Ct. 719, 104 A.L.R. 831 ), was of the view that the California courts excluded these railroad employees from the benefits of the Compensation Act 'because they (the courts) thought the Safety Appliance Acts required the state to afford a remedy in the nature of an action for damages' and for that reason refused to follow their interpretation of the Compensation Act. Although the Tipton case decided the only available California remedy was the compensation scheme, it was indicated that 'a definite and authoritative decision' to the contrary by the California courts would, of course, be followed. \n13\n Tipton lost through the determination here that California had declared by its statute he must seek relief through compensation.\n In the present case, Breisch sued at common law. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment in his favor on the ground that the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act supplied the exclusive remedy for his injury. To reach this conclusion, the Court determined that in Miller v. Reading Company14 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that 'the Compensation Act did not apply to Miller's case, not as a matter of the statutory construction of that Act but because it thought that the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n proper construction of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts required the ruling that Miller had a cause of action under the Safety Appliance Acts, cognizable in a court of law but not within the purview of the Compensation Law.' (112 F.2d 598.) Reliance was placed upon the Tipton case and Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Company15 which support the principle that interpretation of state statutes by state courts under compulsion of federal law erroneously understood does not bind federal courts.\n It is not apparent to us, however, that the Miller opinion depends upon the compulsion of a misunderstanding of the Safety Appliance Acts. In McMahan v. Montour Railroad Company,16 it is true, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held the Compensation Act was the exclusive remedy for injuries to employees of interstate railroad highways, when the employees at the time of the injury were engaged in an intrastate movement. But that case was predicated upon an erroneous conception of the relation of the employee to interstate commerce. It was thought that only employees who were engaged in that commerce at the time of the accident were covered by the Safety Appliance Acts. \n17\n Nothing was said as to the tribunal which might award relief in employments covered by the Safety Appliance Acts. This Court's citations on reversal dealt only with the scope of the federal acts, not with remedies under them. \n18\n When the question next arose, in the Miller case, the Pennsylvania court undertook an interpretation of the scope of the coverage of the Workmen's Compensation Act. That act provides in Section 302, 77 P.S.Pa.  461:\n'(a) In every contract of hiring made after December thirty-first, one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 490]\n\u00a0\n in every contract of hiring renewed or extended by mutual consent, expressed or implied, after said date, it shall be conclusively presumed that the parties have accepted the provisions of article three of this act, and have agreed to be bound thereby, unless there be ....'\n\n (Article three is the compensation schedule 77 P.S.Pa.  411 et seq.) There are no exceptions to this except the customary exemptions of domestic service or agriculture. \n19\n In the Miller case, compensation coverage was refused employees of interstate roads engaged in intrastate activities in these words:\n'Our Workmen's Compensation Act gave to a board exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings to adjudicate claims of employees, which, by consent, express or implied, it was agreed should be so disposed of, and, as to such cases, jurisdiction of the courts to try and determine is ousted. But as to demands not arising from the ordinary relation of employer and employee, such as the enforcement of rights fixed by federal statute, their powers remain as if no such state legislation was in force.' 20\n\n Though there undoubtedly were other statements in the course of the opinion which reflect a misconception of the state's authority over procedure for recovery under the Safety Appliance Acts, we conclude that such misconception is not enough to call for a refusal to follow the Supreme Court's definite ruling that the state courts were open for redress for accidents covered by the Safety Appliance Acts.\n State Tax Commission v. Van Cott,21 relied upon to support the conclusion reached below, is not controlling. In that case a direct review of the question decided by the state court was sought here on the ground that the state's conclusion on a matter of construction of a state \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 491]\n\u00a0\n income tax statute was controlled by the decisions of this Court on the taxability by states of salaries of federal employees. It was not clear to us whether the state decision was controlled by the state court's view of our decisions or not. And, as our decisions at the time of review here permitted a decision by the state court on the state statute, free from federal constraint, we returned the case for state action. In the Van Cott case we were reviewing an application of federal law by a state court to a solution of a state's problems. Here we have a federal court's interpretation of a long standing state decision. Uncompleted state action, probably influenced by decisions of this Court subsequently overruled, calls for an opportunity for the state to adjudicate the question for itself, while a fixed interpretation of a state statute should be accepted by the federal courts when it does not obviously depend altogether on a misconception of federal law.\n There are other factors which forbid the conclusion below. A Pennsylvania statute, derived from the state's common law,22 provides 'That when a court of last resort has construed the language used in a law, the Legislature in subsequent laws on the same subject matter intend the same construction to be placed upon such language.' \n23\n Since the Miller case the compensation act has been amended several times,24 but the Legislature has never attempted to override the limitations read into it by the Miller opinion. There were comprehensive amendments in the 1937 reenactment,25 more than a year \n\n[312 \nU.S. 484, 492]\n\u00a0\n after this Court's decision in the Tipton case established that the compensation remedy could be made exclusive, but still the Legislature took no action. Under these circumstances we are of the opinion that the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania of its own Workmen's Compensation Act and of the jurisdiction of its courts over claims arising under the Safety Appliance Act is binding upon the federal courts and should be followed.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of April 14, 1910,  2, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C.A.  11. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 3 Cir., 112 F.2d 595. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 292 Pa. 44, 140 A. 618. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Texas & Pacific R.

Wirin, of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner Bridges.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. B. Cosgrove and John N.

Ashburn, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents Superior Court Los Angeles County.\n Mr. Allen W. Ashburn, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent State of California.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases, while growing out of different circumstances and concerning different parties, both relate to the scope of our national constitutional policy safeguarding free speech and a free press. All of the petitioners were adjudged guilty and fined for contempt of court by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Their conviction rested upon comments pertaining to pending litigation which were published in newspapers. In the Superior Court and later in the California Supreme Court, petitioners challenged the state's action as an abridgment, prohibited by the Federal Constitution, of freedom of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n speech and of the press, but the Superior Court overruled this contention, and the Supreme Court affirmed. \n1\n The importance of the constitutional question prompted us to grant certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 649\n, 60 S.Ct. 807; \n310 \nU.S. 623\n, 60 S.Ct. 1098\n\n\n In brief, the state courts asserted and exercised a power to punish petitioners for publishing their views concerning cases not in all respects finally determined, upon the following chain of reasoning: California is invested with the power and duty to provide an adequate administration of justice; by virtue of this power and duty, it can take appropriate measures for providing fair judicial trials free from coercion or intimidation; included among such appropriate measures is the common law procedure of punishing certain interferences and obstructions through contempt proceedings; this particular measure, devolving upon the courts of California by reason of their creation as courts, includes the power to punish for publications made outside the court room if they tend to interfere with the fair and orderly administration of justice in a pending case; the trial court having found that the publications had such a tendency, and there being substantial evidence to support the finding, the punishments here imposed were an appropriate exercise of the state's power; in so far as these punishments constitute a restriction on liberty of expression, the public interest in that liberty was properly subordinated to the public interest in judicial impartiality and decorum. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 260]\n\u00a0\n If the inference of conflict raised by the last clause be correct, the issue before us is of the very gravest moment. For free speech and fair trials are two of the most cherished policies of our civilization, and it would be a trying task to choose between them. But even if such a conflict is not actually raised by the question before us, we are still confronted with the delicate problems entailed in passing upon the deliberations of the highest court of a state. This is not, however, solely an issue between state and nation, as it would be if we were called upon to mediate in one of those troublous situations where each claims to be the repository of a particular sovereign power. To be sure, the exercise of power here in question was by a state judge. But in deciding whether or not the sweeping constitutional mandate against any law 'abridging the freedom of speech or of the press' forbids it, we are necessarily measuring a power of all American courts, both state and federal, including this one.\n\n\n I\n\n\n It is to be noted at once that we have no direction by the legislature of California that publications outside the court room which comment upon a pending case in a specified manner should be punishable. As we said in Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 307\n, 308 S., 60 S.Ct. 900, 904, 905, 128 A.L.R. 1352, such a 'declaration of the State's policy would weigh heavily in any challenge of the law as infringing constitutional limitations.' But as we also said there, the problem is different where 'the judgment is based on a common law concept of the most general and undefined nature.' Id., 310 U.S. at page 308, 60 S. Ct. at page 905, 128 A.L.R. 1352. Cf. Herndon v. Lowry, \n301 \nU.S. 242\n, 261-264, 57 S.Ct. 732, 740-742. For here the legislature of California has not appraised a particular kind of situation and found a specific danger3 sufficiently \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 261]\n\u00a0\n imminent to justify a restriction on a particular kind of utterance. The judgments below, therefore, do not come to us encased in the armor wrought by prior legislative deliberation. Under such circumstances, this Court has said that 'it must necessarily be found, as an original question' that the specified publications involved created 'such likelihood of bringing about the substantive evil as to deprive (them) of the constitutional protection.' Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 671\n, 45 S.Ct. 625, 631.\n How much 'likelihood' is another question, 'a question of proximity and degree'4 that cannot be completely captured in a formula. In Schenck v. United States, however, this Court said that there must be a determination of whether or not 'the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils.' We recognize that this statement, however helpful, does not comprehend the whole problem. As Mr. Justice Brandeis said in his concurring opinion in Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 374\n, 47 S.Ct. 641, 648: 'This court has not yet fixed the standard by which to determine when a danger shall be deemed clear; how remote the danger may be and yet be deemed present.' \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 262]\n\u00a0\n Nevertheless, the 'clear and present danger' language5 of the Schenck case has afforded practical guidance in a great variety of cases in which the scope of constitutional protections of freedom of expression was in issue. It has been utilized by either a majority or minority of this Court in passing upon the constitutionality of convictions under espionage acts, Schenck v. United States, supra; Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616\n, 40 S.Ct. 17; under a criminal syndicalism act, Whitney v. California, supra; under an 'anti-insurrection' act, Herndon v. Lowry, supra; and for breach of the peace at common law, Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra. And very recently we have also suggested that 'clear and present danger' is an appropriate guide in determining the constitutionality of restrictions upon expression where the substantive evil sought to be prevented by the restriction is 'destruction of life or property, or invasion of the right of privacy.' Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 105\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, 745.\n Moreover, the likelihood, however great that a substantive evil will result cannot alone justify a restriction upon freedom of speech or the press. The evil itself must be 'substantial', Brandeis, J., concurring in Whitney v. California, supra, 274 U.S. at page 374, 47 S.Ct. at page 647; it must be 'serious', Id., 274 U.S. at page 376, 47 S.Ct. at page 648, 71 L.ed. 1095. And \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 263]\n\u00a0\n even the expression of 'legislative preferences or beliefs' cannot transform minor matters of public inconvenience or annoyance into substantive evils of sufficient weight to warrant the curtailment of liberty of expression. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 151.\n What finally emerges from the 'clerk and present danger' cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances can be punished. Those cases do not purport to mark the furthermost constitutional boundaries of protected expression, nor do we here. They do no more than recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights. For the First Amendment6 does not speak equivocally. It prohibits and law 'abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.' It must be taken as a command of the broadest scope that explicit language, read in the context of a liberty- loving society, will allow.\n\n\n II\n\n\n Before analyzing the punished utterances and the circumstances surrounding their publication, we must consider an argument which, if valid, would destroy the relevance of the foregoing discussion to this case. In brief, this argument is that the publications here in question belong to a special category marked off by history, a category to which the criteria of constitutional immunity from punishment used where other types of utterances are concerned are not applicable. For, the argument runs, the power of judges to punish by contempt out-of-court publications tending to obstruct the orderly and fair administration of justice in a pending case was deeply \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 264]\n\u00a0\n rooted in English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted. That this historical contention is dubious has been persuasively argued elsewhere. Fox, Contempt of Court, passim, e.g., 207. See also Stansbury, Trial of James H. Peck, 430. In any event it need not detain us, for to assume that English common law in this field became ours is to deny the generally accepted historical belief that 'one of the objects of the Revolution was to get rid of the English common law on liberty of speech and of the press.' \n7\n Schofield, Freedom of the Press in the United States. 9 Publications Amer. Sociol. Soc., 67, 76.\n More specifically, it is to forget the environment in which the First Amendment was ratified. In presenting the proposals which were later embodied in the Bill of Rights, James Madison, the leader in the preparation of the First Amendment, said: 'Although I know whenever the great rights, the trial by jury, freedom of the press, or liberty of conscience, come in question in that body (Parliament), the invasion of them is resisted by able advocates, yet their Magna Charta does not contain any one provision for the security of those rights, respecting which the people of America are most alarmed. The freedom of the press and rights of conscience, those choicest privileges of the people, are unguarded in the British Constitution.' 1 Annals of Congress 1789-1790, 434. And Madison elsewhere wrote that 'the state of the press ... under the common law, cannot ... be the standard of its freedom in the United States.' VI Writings of James Madison 1790-1802, 387. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 265]\n\u00a0\n There are no contrary implications in any part of the history of the period in which the First Amendment was framed and adopted. No purpose in ratifying the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of securing for the people of the United States much greater freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition than the people of Great Britain had ever enjoyed. It cannot be denied, for example, that the religious test oath8 or the restrictions upon assembly9 then prevalent in England would have been regarded as measures which the Constitution prohibited the American Congress from passing. And since the same unequivocal language is used with respect to freedom of the press, it signifies a similar enlargement of that concept as well. \n10\n Ratified as it was while the memory of many oppressive English restrictions on the enumerated liberties was still fresh, the First Amendment cannot reasonably be taken as approving prevalent English practices. On the contrary, the only conclusion supported by history is that the unqualified prohibitions laid down by the framers were intended to give to liberty of the press, as to the other liberties, the broadest scope that could be countenanced in an orderly society. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 266]\n\u00a0\n The implications of subsequent American history confirm such a construction of the First Amendment. To be sure, it occurred no more to the people who lived in the decades following Ratification than it wuold to us now that the power of courts to protect themselves from disturbances and disorder in the court room by use of contempt proceedings could seriously be challenged as conflicting with constitutionally secured guarantees of liberty. In both state and federal courts, this power has been universally recognized. See Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 227. But attempts to expand it in the post-Ratification years evoked popular reactions that bespeak a feeling of jealous solicitude for freedom of the press. In Pennsylvania and New York, for example, heated controversies arose over alleged abuses in the exercise of the contempt power, which in both places culminated in legislation practically11 forbidding summary punishment for publications. See Nelles and King, Contempt by Publication, 28 Col.L.Rev. 401, 409-422.\n In the federal courts, there was the celebrated case of Judge Peck, recently referred to by this Court in Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33, 45\n, 61 S.Ct. 810, 814. The impeachment proceedings against him, it should be noted, and the strong feelings they engendered, were set in motion by his summary punishment of a lawyer for publishing comment on a case which was on appeal at the time of publication \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 267]\n\u00a0\n and which raised the identical issue of several other cases then pending before him. Here again legislation was the outcome, Congress proclaiming in a statute expressly captioned 'An Act declaratory of the law concerning contempts of court,'12 that the power of federal courts to inflict summary punishment for contempt 'shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehaviour of ... persons in the presence of the said courts, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice ....' When recently called upon to interpret this statute, we overruled the earlier decision of this Court in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402\n, 38 S.Ct. 560, in the belief that it improperly enlarged the stated area of summary punishment. Nye v. United States, supra. Here, as in the Nye case, we need not determine whether the statute was intended to demarcate the full power permissible under the Constitution to punish by contempt proceedings. But we do find in the enactment viewed in its historical context, a respect for the prohibitions of the First Amendment, not as mere guides to the formulation of policy, but as commands the breach of which cannot be tolerated.\n We are aware that although some states have by statute or decision expressly repudiated the power of judges to punish publications as contempts on a finding of mere tendency to interfere with the orderly administration of justice in a pending case, other states have sanctioned the exercise of such a power. (See Nelles and King, loc. cit. supra, 536- 562, for a collection and discussion of state cases.) But state power in this field was not test in this Court for more than a century. \n13\n Not until 1925, with the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 268]\n\u00a0\n decision in Gitlow v. New York, supra, did this Court recognize in the Fourteenth Amendment the application to the states of the same standards of freedom of expression as, under the First Amendment, are applicable to the federal government. And this is the first time since 1925 that we have been called upon to determine the constitutionality of a state's exercise of the contempt power in this kind of situation. Now that such a case is before us, we cannot allow the mere existence of other untested state decisions to destroy the historic constitutional meaning of freedom of speech and of the press.\n History affords no support for the contention that the criteria applicable under the Constitution to other types of utterances are not applicable, in contempt proceedings, to out-of-court publications pertaining to a pending case.\n\n\n III\n\n\n We may appropriately begin our discussion of the judgments below by considering how much, as a practical matter, they would affect liberty of expression. It must be recognized that public interest is much more likely to be kindled by a controversial event of the day then by a generalization, however penetrating, of the historian or scientist. Since they punish utterances made during the pendency of a case, the judgments below therefore produce their restrictive results at the precise time when public interest in the matters discussed would naturally be at its height. Moreover, the ban is likely to fall not only at a crucial time but upon the most important topics of discussion. Here, for example, labor controversies were the topics of some of the publications. Experience shows that the more acute labor controversies are, the more likely \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 269]\n\u00a0\n it is that in some aspect they will get into court. It is therefore the controversies that command most interest that the decisions below would remove from the arena of public discussion.\n No suggestion can be found in the Constitution that the freedom there guaranteed for speech and the press bears an inverse ratio to the timeliness and importance of the ideas seeking expression. Yet, it would follow as a practical result of the decisions below that anyone who might wish to give public expression to his views on a pending case involving no matter what problem of public interest, just at the time his audience would be most receptive, would be as effectively discouraged as if a deliberate statutory scheme of censorship had been adopted. Indeed, perhaps more so, because under a legislative specification of the particular kinds of expressions prohibited and the circumstances under which the prohibitions are to operate, the speaker or publisher might at least have an authoritative guide to the permissible scope of comment, instead of being compelled to act at the peril that judges might find in the utterance a 'reasonable tendency' to obstruct justice in a pending case.\n This unfocussed threat is, to be sure, limited in time, terminating as it does upon final disposition of the case. But this does not change its censorial quality. An endless series of moratoria on public discussion, even if each were very short, could hardly be dismissed as an insignificant abridgment of freedom of expression. And to assume that each would be short is to overlook the fact that the 'pendency' of a case is frequently a matter of months or even years rather than days or weeks. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 270]\n\u00a0\n For these reasons we are convinced that the judgments below result in a curtailment of expression that cannot be dismissed as insignificant. If they can be justified at all, it must be in terms of some serious substantive evil which they are designed to avert. The substantive evil here sought to be averted has been variously described below. \n15\n It appears to be double: disrespect for the judiciary; and disorderly and unfair administration of justice. The assumption that respect for the judiciary can be won by shielding judges from published criticism wrongly appraises the character of American public opinion. For it is a prized American privilege to speak one's mind, although not always with perfect good taste, 16 on all public institutions. And an enforced silence, however limited, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 271]\n\u00a0\n solely in the name of preserving the dignify of the bench, would probably engender resentment, suspicion, and contempt much more than it would enhance respect.\n The other evil feared, disorderly and unfair administration of justice, is more plausibly associated with restricting publications which touch upon pending litigation. The very would 'trial' connotes decisions on the evidence and arguments properly advanced in open court. Legal trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting- hall, the radio, and the newspaper. But we cannot start with the assumption that publications of the kind here involved actually do threaten to change the nature of legal trials, and that to preserve judicial impartiality, it is necessary for judges to have a comtempt power by which they can close all channels of public expression to all matters which touch upon pending cases. We must therefore turn to the particular utterances here in question and the circumstances of their publication to determine to what extent the substantive evil of unfair administration of justice was a likely consequence, and whether the degre of likelihood was sufficient to justify summary punishment.\n The Los Angeles Times Editorials. The Times-Mirror Company, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and L. D. Hotchkiss, its managing editor were cited for contempt for the publication of three editorials. Both found by the trial court to be responsible for one of the editorials, the company and Hotchkiss were each fined $100. The company alone was held responsible for the other two, and was fined $100 more on account of one, and $300 more on account of the other.\n The $300 fine presumably marks the most serious offense. The editorial thus distinguished was entitled 'Probation for Gorillas?'. After vigorously denouncing two members of a labor union who had previously been \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 272]\n\u00a0\n found guilty of assaulting non-union truck drivers, it closes with the observation: 'Judge A. A. Scott will make a serious mistake if he grants probation to Matthew Shannon and Kennan Holmes. This community needs the example of their assignment to the jute mill.' \n17\n Judge Scott had previously set a day (about a month after the publication) for passing upon the application of Shannon and Holmes for probation and for pronouncing sentence.\n The basis for punishing the publication as contempt was by the trial court said to be its 'inherent tendency' and by the Supreme Court its 'reasonable tendency' to interfere with the orderly administration of justice in an \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 273]\n\u00a0\n action then before a court for consideration. In accordance with what we have said on the 'clear and present danger' cases, neither 'inherent tnedency' nor 'reasonable tendency' is enough to justify a restriction of free expression. But even if they were appropriate measures, we should find exaggeration in the use of those phrases to describe the facts here.\n From the indications in the record of the position taken by the Los Angeles Times on labor controversies in the past, there could have been little doubt of its attitude toward the probation of Shannon and Holmes. In view of the paper's longcontinued militancy in this field, it is inconceivable that any judge in Los Angeles would expect anything but adverse criticism from it in the event probation were granted. Yet such criticism after final disposition of the proceedings would clearly have been privileged. Hence, this editorial, given the most intimidating construction it will bear, did no more than threaten future adverse criticism which was reasonably to be expected anyway in the event of a lenient disposition of the pending case. \n18\n To regard it, therefore, as in itself of substantial influence upon the course of justice would be to impute to judges a lack of firmness, wisdom, or honor, which we cannot accept as a major premise. Cf. Holmes, J., dissenting in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402, 424\n, 38 S.Ct. 560, 565. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 274]\n\u00a0\n The other two editorials publication of which was fined below are set out in the lower margin. \n19\n With respect to these two editorials, there is no divergence of conclusions among the members of this Court. We are all of the opinion that, upon any fair construction, their possible influence on the course of justice can be dismissed as negligible, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 275]\n\u00a0\n and that the Constitution compels us to set aside the convictions as unpermissible exercises of the state's power. In view of the foregoing discussion of 'Probation for Gorillas?', analysis of these editorials and their setting is deemed unnecessary.\n The Bridges Telegram. While a motion for a new trial was pending in a case involving a dispute between an\n__________ not in sympathy with it, what should be the terms and conditions of working, has proved to be within the control of labor peace officers and authorities.\n'Nobody ran off to Washington to get this affair handled. It was attended to right here.\n\n'Government may have broken down in other localities; whole States may have yielded to anarchy. But Los Angeles county stands firm; it has officers who can do their duty and courts and juries which can function.\n\n'So long as that is the case, davebeckism cannot and will not get control here; nor johnlewisism either.'\n\n The second of these editorials, entitled 'The Fall of an Ex-Queen', was published in The Los Angeles Times of April 14, 1938. Here, too, publication took place after a jury had found the subject of the editorial guilty, but before the trial judge had pronounced sentence. The editorial follows in its entirety:\n'Politics as we know it is an essentially selfish business, conducted in the main for personal profit of one kind or another. When it is of the boss type, it is apt to be pretty sorbid as well. Success in boss-ship, which is a denial of public rights, necessarily implies a kind of moral obliquity if not an actually illegal one.\n\n'So that it is something of a contradiction of sense if not of terms to express regret that the political talents of Mrs. Helen Werner were not directed to other objectives than those which, in the twilight of her active life, have brought her and her husband to disgrace. If they had been, she would not have been in politics at all and probably would never have been heard of in a public way. Her natural flair was purely political; she would have been miscast in any other sphere of activity.\n\n'Mrs. Werner's primary mistake seems to have been in failing to recognize that her political day was past. For years she enjoyed the unique distinction of being the country's only woman boss-and did she enjoy it! In her heyday she had a finger in every political pie and many were the plums she was able to extract therefrom for those \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 276]\n\u00a0\n A.F. of L. union and a C.I.O. union of which Bridges was an officer, he either caused to be published or acquiesced in the publication of a telegram which he had sent to the Secretary of Labor. The telegram referred to the judge's decision as 'out said that attempted enforcement of it would tie up the port of Los Angeles and involve the entire Pacific Coast; and concluded with the announcement that the C.I.O. union, representing some twelve thousand members, did 'not intend to allow state courts to override the majority vote of members in choosing its officers and representatives and to override the National Labor Relations Board.' \n20\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 277]\n\u00a0\n Apparently Bridges' conviction is not rested at all upon his use of the word 'outrageous.' The remainder of the telegram fairly construed appears to be a statement that if the court's decree should be enforced there would be a strike. It is not claimed that such a strike would have been in violation of the terms of the decree, nor that in any other way it would have run afoul of the law of California. On no construction, therefore, can the telegram be taken as a threat either by Bridges or the union to follow an illegal course of action.\n\n Moreover, this statement of Bridges was made to the Secretary of Labor, who is charged with official duties in connection with the prevention of strikes. Whatever the cause might be, if a strike was threatened or possible the Secretary was entitled to receive all avaialble information. Indeed, the Supreme Court of California recognized that, publication in the newspapers aside, in sending the message to the Secretary, Bridges was exercising the right of petition to a duly accredited representative of the United States government, a right protected by the First Amendment. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n It must be recognized that Bridges was a prominent labor leader speaking at a time when public interest in the particular labor controversy was at its heeight. The observations we have previously made here upon the time- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 278]\n\u00a0\n liness and importance of utterances as emphasizing rather than diminishing the value of constitutional protection, and upon the breadth and seriousness of the censorial effects of punishing publications in the manner followed below are certainly no less applicable to a leading spokesman for labor than to a powerful newspaper taking another point of view.\n In looking at the reason advanced in support of the judgment of contempt, we find that here, too, the possibility of causing unfair disposition of a pending case is the major justification asserted. And here again the gist of the offense, according to the court below, is intimidation.\n Let us assume that the telegram could be construed as an announcement of Bridges' intention to call a strike, something which, it is admitted, neither the general law of California nor the court's decree prohibited. With an eye on the realities of the situation, we cannot assume that Judge Schmidt was unaware of the possibility of a strike as a consequence of his decision. If he was not intimidated by the facts themselves, we do not believe that the most explicit statement of them could have sidetracked the course of justice. Again, we find exaggeration in the conclusion that the utterance even 'tended' to interfere with justice. If there was electricity in the atmosphere, it was generated by the facts; the charge added by the Bridges telegram can be dismissed as negligible. The words of Mr. Justice Holmes, spoken in reference to very different facts, seem entirely applicable here: 'If confess that I cannot find in all this or in the evidence in the case anything that would have affected a mind of reasonable fortitude, and still less can I find there anything that obstructed the administration of justice in any sense that I possibly can give to those words.' Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, 247 U. S. at page 425, 38 S.Ct. at page 566.\n Reversed. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 279]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, with whom concurred the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice BYRNES, dissenting.\n Our whole history repels the view that it is an exercise of one of the civil liberties secured by the Bill of Rights for a leader of a large following or for a powerful metropolitan newspaper to attempt to overawe a judge in a matter immediately pending before him. The view of the majority deprives California of means for securing to its citizens justice according to law-means which, since the Union was founded, have been the possession, hitherto unchallenged, of all the states. This sudden break with the uninterrupted course of constitutional history has no constitutional warrant. To find justification for such deprivation of the historic powers of the states is to misconceive the idea of freedom of thought and speech as guaranteed by the Constitution.\n Deeming it more important than ever before to enforce civil liberties with a generous outlook, but deeming it no less essential for the assurance of civil liberties that the federal system founded upon the Constitution be maintained, we believe that the careful ambiguities and silences of that majority opinion call for a full exposition of the issues in these cases.\n While the immediate question is that of determining the power of the courts of California to deal with attempts to coerce their judgments in litigation immediately before them, the consequence of the Court's ruling today is a denial to the people of the forty-eight states of a right which they have always regarded as essential for the effective exercise of the judicial process, as well as a denial to the Congress of powers which were exercised from the very beginning even by the framers of the Consitution themselves. To be sure, the majority do not in so many words hold that trial by newspapers has constitutional \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 280]\n\u00a0\n sanctity. But the atmosphere of their opinion and several of its phrases mean that or they mean nothing. Certainly, the opinion is devoid of any frank recognition of the right of courts to deal with utterances calculated to intimidate the fair course of justice-a right which hitherto all the states have from time to time seen fit to confer upon their courts and which Congress conferred upon the federal courts in the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73. If all that is decided today is that the majority deem the specific interferences with the administration of justice in California so tenuously related to the right of California to keep its courts free from coercion as to constitute a check upon free speech rather than upon impartial justice, it would be well to say so. Matters that involve so deeply the powers of the states and that put to the test the professions by this Court of self-restraint in nullifying the political powers of state and nation, should not be left clouded.\n We are not even vouchsafed reference to the specific provision of the Constitution which renders states powerless to insist upon trail by courts rather than trial by newspapers. So far as the Congress of the United States is concerned, we are referred to the First Amendment. That is specific. But we are here dealing with limitations upon California-with restraints upon the states. To say that the protection of freedom of speech of the First Amendment is absorbed by the Fourteenth does not say enough. Which one of the various limitations upon state power introduced by the Fourteenth Amendment absorbs the First? Some provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment apply only to citizens, and one of the petitioners here is an alien; some of its provisions apply only to natural persons, and another petitioner here is a corporation. See Hague v. C.I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 514\n, 59 S.Ct. 954, 963, and cases cited. Only the Due Process Clause assures constitutional protection of civil liberties to aliens and corporations. Corporations \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 281]\n\u00a0\n cannot claim for themselves the 'liberty' which the Due Process Clause guarantees. That clause protects only their property. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 535\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 39 A.L.R. 468. The majority opinion is strangely silent in failing to avow the specific constitutional provision upon which its decision rests.\n These are not academic debating points or technical niceties. Those who have gone before us have admonished us 'that in a free representative government nothing is more fundamental than the right of the people, through their appointed servants, to govern themselves in accordance with their own will, except so far as they have restrained themselves by constitutional limits specifically established, and that, in our peculiar dual form of government, nothing is more fundamental than the full power of the state to order its own affairs and govern its own people, except so far as the Federal Constitution, expressly or by fair implication, has withdrawn that power. The power of the people of the states to make and alter their laws at pleasure is the greatest security for liberty and justice .... We are not invested with the jurisdiction to pass upon the expediency, wisdom, or justice of the laws of the states as declared by their courts, but only to determine their conformity with the Federal Constitution and the paramount laws enacted pursuant to it. Under the guise of interpreting the Constitution we must take care that we do not import into the discussion our own personal views of what would be wise, just, and fitting rules of government to be adopted by a free people, and confound them with constitutional limitations.' Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 106\n, 107 S., 29 S.Ct. 14, 22.\n In a series of opinions as uncompromising as any in its history, this Court has settled that the fullest opportunities for free discussion are 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment,' protected against attempted invasion by \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 282]\n\u00a0\n the States. Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 324\n, 325 S., 58 S.Ct. 149, 152. The channels of inquiry and thought must be kept open to new conquests of reason, however odious their expression may be to the prevailing claimate of opinion. But liberty 'in each of its phases, has its history and connotation'. Whether a particular state action violates 'the essential attributes of that liberty' must be judged in the light of the liberty that is invoked and the curtailment that is challenged. Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 708\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 628. For 'the recognition of a privilege does not mean that it is without conditions or exceptions. The social policy that will prevail in many situations may run foul in others of a different social policy, competing for supremacy. It is then the function of a court to mediate between them, assigning, so far as possible, a proper value to each, and summoning to its aid all the distinctions and analogies that are the tools of the judicial process'. Clark v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 53 S.Ct. 465, 469.\n Free speech is not so absolute or irrational a conception as to imply paralysis of the means for effective protection of all the freedoms secured by the Bill of Rights. Compare Lincoln's Message to Congress in Special Session, July 4, 1861, 7 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, pp. 3221-3232. In the cases before us, the claims on behalf of freedom of speech and of the press encounter claims on behalf of liberties no less precious. California asserts her right to do what she has done as a means of safeguarding her system of justice.\n The administration of justice by an impartial judiciary has been basic to our conception of freedom ever since Magna Carta. It is the concern not merely of the immediate litigants. Its assurance is everyone's concern, and it is protected by the liberty guaranteed by the Fourtenth Amendment. That is why this Court has outlawed mob domination of a courtroom, Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 265, mental coercion of a defendant, Chambers v. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 283]\n\u00a0\n Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472, a judicial system which does not provide disinterested judges, Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, 47 S. Ct. 437, 50 A.L.R. 1243, and discriminatory selection of jurors, Pierre v. Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354\n, 59 S.Ct. 536; Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128\n, 61 S.Ct. 164.\n A trial is not a 'free trade in ideas', nor is the best test of truth in a courtroom 'the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market'. Compare Mr. Justice Holmes in Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 630\n, 40 S.Ct. 17, 22. A court is a forum with strictly defined limits for discussion. It is circumscribed in the range of its inquiry and in its methods by the Constitution, by laws, and by age-old traditions. Its judges are restrained in their freedom of expression by historic compulsions resting on no other officials of government. They are so circumscribed precisely because judges have in their keeping the enforcement of rights and the protection of liberties which, according to the wisdom of the ages, can only be enforced and protected by observing such methods and traditions.\n The dependence of society upon an unswerved judiciary is such a commonplace in the history of freedom that the means by which it is maintained are too frequently taken for granted without heed to the conditions which alone make it possible. The role of courts of justice in our society has been the theme of statesmen and historians and constitution makers. It is perhaps best expressed in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights: 'It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and administration of justice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit.' Const.Mass. pt. 1, art. 29.\n The Constitution was not conceived as a doctrinaire document, nor was the Bill of Rights intended as a collection of popular slogans. We are dealing with instruments \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 284]\n\u00a0\n of government. We cannot read into the Fourteenth Amendment the freedom of speech and of the press protected by the First Amendment and at the same time read out age-old means employed by states for securing the calm course of justice. The Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid a state to continue the historic process of prohibiting expressions calculated to subvert a specific exercise of judicial power. So to assure the impartial accomplishment of justice is not an abridgment of freedom of speech or freedom of the press, as these phases of liberty have heretofore been conceived even by the stoutest libertarians. In fact, these liberties themselves depend upon an untrammeled judiciary whose passions are not even unconsciously aroused and whose minds are not distorted by extrajudicial considerations.\n Of course freedom of speech and of the press are essential to the enlightenment of a free people and in restraining those who wield power. Particularly should this freedom be employed in comment upon the work of courts who are without many influences ordinarily making for humor and humility, twin antidotes to the corrosion of power. But the Bill of Rights is not self-destructive. Freedom of expression can hardly carry implications that nullify the guarantees of impartial trials. And since courts are the ultimate resorts for vindicating the Bill of Rights, a state may surely authorize appropriate historic means to assure that the process for such vindication be not wrenched from its rational tracks into the more primitive me le e of passion and pressure. The need is great that courts be criticized but just as great that they be allowed to do their duty.\n The 'liberty' secured by the Fourteenth Amendment summarizes the experience of history. And the power exerted by the courts of California is deeply rooted in the system of administering justice evolved by liberty- loving English speaking peoples. From the earliest days of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 285]\n\u00a0\n English courts, they have encountered obstructions to doing that for which they exist, namely, to administer justice impartially and solely with reference to what comes before them. These interferences were of diverse kinds. But they were all covered by the infelicitous phrase 'contempt of court', and the means for dealing with them is historically known as the power of courts to punish for contempt. As is true of many aspects of our legal institutions, the settled doctrines concerning the mode of procedure for exercising the power of contempt became established on dubious historical authority. Exact legal scholarship has controverted much pertaining to the origin of summary proceedings for contempt. See Sir John Fox, The History of Contempt of Court, passim. But there is no doubt that since the early eighteenth century, the power to punish for contempt for intrusions into the living process of adjudication has been an unquestioned characteristic of English courts and of the courts of this country.\n The judicatures of the English-speaking world, including the courts of the United States and of the forty-eight states, have from time to time recognized and exercised the power now challenged. (For partial lists of cases, see Nelles and King, Contempt by Publication in the United States, 28 Col.L.Rev. 401, 525, 554; Sullivan, Contempts by Publication, p. 185 et seq.) A declaratory formulation of the common law was written into the Judiciary Act of 1789 ( 17, 1 Stat. 73, 83) by Oliver Ellsworth, one of the framers of the Constitution, later to become Chief Justice; the power was early recognized as incidental to the very existence of courts in a succession of opinions in this Court (United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32; Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 227; Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38); it was expounded and supported by the great Commentaries that so largely influenced the shaping of our law in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 286]\n\u00a0\n turies, those of Blackstone, Kent and Story; its historic continuity withstood attack against state action under the Due Process Clause, now again invoked, Eilenbecker v. Plymouth County, \n134 \nU.S. 31\n, 10 S.Ct. 424; and see Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505; Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289\n, 9 S.Ct. 77; Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S.Ct. 699.1 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 287]\n\u00a0\n As in the exercise of all power, it was abused. Some English judges extended their authority for checking interferences with judicial business actually in hand, to 'lay by the heel' those responsible for 'scandalizing the court', that is, bringing it into general disrepute. Such foolishness has long since been disavowed in England and has never found lodgment here. But even the technical power of punishing interference with the court's business is susceptible of abuse. As early as 1809, Pennsylvania restricted the power to inflict summary punishment for contempts to a closely defined class of misconduct, and provided the ordinary criminal procedure for other forms of interferences with a pending cause. 1808-09 Pa.Acts, c. 78, p. 146.2 The flagrant case of Judge Peck3 led Con- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 288]\n\u00a0\n gress to pass the Act of March 2, 1831, 4 Stat. 487, 28 U.S.C.  385, 28 U. S.C.A.  385, the scope of which we recently considered. Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33\n, 61 S.Ct. 810. A number of states copied the federal statute. It would be pedantic to trace the course of legislation and of adjudication on this subject in our half-hundred jurisdictions. Suffice it to say that the hitherto unchallenged power of American states to clothe their courts with authority to punish for contempt was thus summarized only recently by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in the leading case vindicating the liberty of the press against state action: 'There is also the conceded authority of courts to punish for contempt when publications directly tend to prevent the proper discharge of judicial functions.' Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 715\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 630.4 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 289]\n\u00a0\n It is trifling with great issues to suggest that the question before us is whether eighteenth-century restraints upon the freedom of the press should now be revived. The question is rather whether nineteenth- and twentieth-century American institutions should be abrogated by judicial fiat.\n That a state may, under appropriate circumstances, prevent interference with specific exercises of the process of impartial adjudication does not mean that its people lose the right to condemn decisions or the judges who render them. Judges as persons, or courts as institutions, are entitled to no greater immunity from criticism than other persons or institutions. Just because the holders of judicial office are identified with the interests of justice they may forget their comon human frailties and fallibilities. There have sometimes been martinets upon the bench as there have also been pompous wielders of authority who have used the paraphernalia of power in support of what they called their dignity. Therefore judges must be kept mindful of their limitations and of their ultimate public responsibility by a vigorous stream of criticism expressed with candor however blunt. \n5\n 'A \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 290]\n\u00a0\n man cannot be summarily laid by the heels because his words may make public feeling more unfavorable in case the judge should be asked to act at some later date, any more than he can for exciting public feeling against a judge for what he already has done.' Mr. Justice Holmes in Craig v. Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255, 281\n, 282 S., 44 S.Ct. 103, 107, 108. But the Constitution does not bar a state from acting on the theory of our system of justice, that the 'conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.' Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S.Ct. 556, 558, 10 Ann.Cas. 689. The theory of our system of justice as thus stated for the Court by Mr. Justice Holmes has never been questioned by any member of the Court. It was questioned neither by Mr. Justice Harlan nor by Mr. Justice Brewer in their dissents in the Patterson case. The differences in that case concerned the question whether 'there is to be found in the 14th Amendment a prohibition similar to that in the 1st', and, if so, what the scope of that protection is. The first question was settled in the affirmative by a series of cases beginning with Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, 45 S.Ct. 625. And that the scope of the First Amendment was broader than was intimated in the opinion in the Patterson case, was later recognized by Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, in Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S.Ct. 247. But that the conventional power to punish for contempt is not a censorship in advance but a punishment for past conduct and, as such, like prosecution for a criminal libel, is not offensive either to the First or to the Fourteenth Amendments, has never been doubted throughout this Court's history.\n This conception of justice, the product of a long and arduous effort in the history of freedom, is one of the greatest achievements of civilization, and is not less to be cherished at a time when it is repudiated and derided by \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 291]\n\u00a0\n powerful . 'The right to use and defend in the courts is the alternative of force. In an organized society it is the right conservative of all other rights, and lies at the foundation of orderly government.' Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 28 S.Ct. 34, 35. This has nothing to do with curtailing expression of opinion, be it political, economic, or religious, that may be offensive to orthodox views. It has to do with the power of the state to discharge an indispensable function of civilized society, that of adjudicating controversies between its citizens and between citizens and the state through legal tribunals in accordance with their historic procedures. Courts and judges must take their share of the gains and pains of discussion which is unfettered except by laws of libel, by selfrestraint, and by good taste. Winds of doctrine should freely blow for the promotion of good and the correction of evil. Nor should restrictions be permitted that cramp the feeling of freedom in the use of tongue or pen regardless of the temper or the truth of what may be uttered.\n Comment however forthright is one thing. Intimidation with respect to specific matters still in judicial suspense, quite another. See Laski, Procedure for Constructive Contempt in England, 41 Harv.L.Rev. 1031, 1034; Goodhart, Newspapers and Contempt in English Law, 48 Harv.L.Rev. 885. A publication intended to teach the judge a lesson, or to vent spleen, or to discredit him, or to influence him in his future conduct, would not justify exercise of the contempt power. Compare Judge Learned Hand in Ex parte Craig, 2 Cir., 282 F. 138, 160, 161. It must refer to a matter under consideration and constitute in effect a threat to its impartial disposition. It must be calculated to create an atmospheric pressure incompatible with rational, impartial adjudication. But to interfere with justice it need not succeed. As with other offenses, the state should be able to proscribe attempts that fail because of the danger that attempts may succeed. The pur- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 292]\n\u00a0\n pose, it will do no harm to repeat, is not to protect the court as a mystical entity or the judges as individuals or as annointed priests set apart from the community and spared the criticism to which in a democracy other public servants are exposed. The purpose is to protect immediate litigants and the public from the mischievous danger of an unfree or coerced tribunal. The power should be invoked only where the adjudicatory process may be hampered or hindered in its calm, detached, and fearless discharge of its duty on the basis of what has been submitted in court. The belief that decisions are so reached is the source of the confidence on which law ultimately rests.\n It will not do to argue that a state cannot permit its judges to resist coercive interference with their work in hand because other officials of government must endure such obstructions. In such matters 'a page of history is worth a volume of logic.' New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345, 349\n, 41 S.Ct. 506, 507, 16 A.L.R. 660. Presidents and governors and legislators are political officials traditionally subject to political influence and the rough and tumble of the hustings, who have open to them traditional means of self-defense. In a very immediate sense, legislators and executives express the popular will. But judges do not express the popular will in any ordinary meaning of the term. The limited power to punish for contempt which is here involved wholly rejects any assumption that judges are superior to other officials. They merely exercise a function historically and intrinsically different. From that difference is drawn the power which has behind it the authority and the wisdom of our whole history. Because the function of judges and that of other officials in special situations may approach similarity, hard cases can be put which logically may contradict the special quality of the judicial process. 'But the provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 293]\n\u00a0\n they are organic, living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.' Gompers v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 604, 610\n, 34 S. Ct. 693, 695, Ann.Cas.1915D, 1044.\n We are charged here with the duty, always delicate, of sitting in judgment on state power. We must be fastidiously careful not to make our private views the measure of constitutional authority. To be sure, we are here concerned with an appeal to the great liberties which the Constitution assures to all our people, even against state denial. When a substantial claim of an abridgment of these liberties is advanced, the presumption of validity that belongs to an exercise of state power must not be allowed to impair such a liberty or to check our close examination of the merits of the controversy. But the utmost protection to be accorded to freedom of speech and of the press cannot displace our duty to give due regard also to the state's power to deal with what may essentially be local situations.\n Because freedom of public expression alone assures the unfolding of truth, it is indispensable to the democratic process. But even that freedom is not an absolute and is not predetermined. By a doctrinaire overstatement of its scope and by giving it an illusory absolute appearance, there is danger of thwarting the free choice and the responsibility of exercising it which are basic to a democratic society. While we are reviewing a judgment of the California Supreme Court and not an act of its legislature or the voice of the people of California formally expressed in its constitution, we are in fact passing judgment on 'the power of the state as a whole.' Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n, 24 S.Ct. 516, 517; Skiriotes v. Florida, \n313 \nU.S. 69, 79\n, 61 S.Ct. 924, 930; United Gas Co. v. Texas, \n303 \nU.S. 123, 142\n, 58 S.Ct. 483, 492; Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 24 S.Ct. 53, 54, 63 L.R.A. 571; Iowa-Des Moines Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 244\n, 52 S.Ct. 133, 135. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 294]\n\u00a0\n By the constitution of California, as authoritatively construed by its Supreme Court and therefore as binding upon this Court as though ratified by all the voters of California, the citizens of that state have chosen to place in its courts the power, as we have defined it, to insure impartial justice. If the citizens of California have other desires, if they want to permit the free play of modern publicity in connection with pending litigation, it is within their easy power to say so and to have their way. They have ready means of amending their constitution and they have frequently made use of them. We are, after all, sitting over three thousand miles away from a great state without intimate knowledge of its habits and its needs in a matter which does not cut across the affirmative powers of the national government. Some play of policy must be left to the states in the task of accommodating individual rights and the overriding public well-being which makes those rights possible. How are we to know whether an easy-going or stiffer view of what affects the actual administration of justice is appropriate to local circumstances? How are we to say that California has no right to model its judiciary upon the qualities and standards attained by the English administration of justice, and to use means deemed appropriate to that end by English courts. \n6\n It is surely an arbitrary judgment to say that the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 295]\n\u00a0\n Due Process Clause denies California that right. For respect for 'the liberty of the subject' though not explicitly written into a constitution, is so deeply embedded in the very texture of English feeling and conscience7 that it survives, as the pages of Hansard abundantly prove, the exigencies of the life and death struggle of the British people. See, e.g., Carr, Concerning English Administrative Law, c. 3 ('Crisis Legislation').\n The rule of law applied in these cases by the California court forbade publications having 'a 'reasonable tendency' to interfere with the orderly administration of justice in pending actions'. (94 P.2d 983, 995) To deny that this age-old formulation of the prohibition against interference with dispassionate adjudication is properly confined to the substantive evil is not only to turn one's back on history but also to indulge in an idle play on words unworthy of constitutional adjudication. It was urged before us that the words 'reasonable tendency' had a fatal pervasiveness, and that their replacement by 'clear and present danger' was required to state a constitutionally permissible rule of law. The Constitution, as we have recently had occasion to remark, is not a formulary. Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435, 444\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 249, 130 A.L.R. 1229. Nor does it require displacement of an historic test by a phrase which first gained currency on March 3, 1919. Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S.Ct. 247. Our duty is not ended with the recita- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 296]\n\u00a0\n tion of phrases that are the short-hand of a complicated historic process. The phrase 'clear and present danger' is merely a justification for curbing utterance where that is warranted by the substantive evil to be prevented. The phrase itself is an expression of tendency and not of accomplishment, and the literary difference between it and 'reasonable tendency' is not of constitutional dimension.\n Here the substantive evil to be eliminated is interference with impartial adjudication. To determine what interferences may be made the basis for contempt tenders precisely the same kind of issues as that to which the 'clear and present danger' test gives rise. 'It is a question of proximity and degree.' Schenck v. United States, supra, 249 U.S. at page 52, 39 S.Ct. at page 249. And this, according to Mr. Justice Brandeis 'is a rule of reason. ... Like many other rules for human conduct, it can be applied correctly only by the exercise of good judgment.' Schaefer v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 466, 482\n, 483 S., 40 S.Ct. 259, 264, 265. Has California's judgment here undermined liberties protected by the Constitution? In common with other questions of degree, this is to be solved not by short-hand phrases but by consideration of the circumstances of the particular case. One cannot yell 'Fire' in a crowded theater; police officers cannot turn their questioning into an instrument of mental oppression. Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472.\n If a rule of state law is not confined to the evil which may be dealt with but places an indiscriminate ban on public expression that operates as an overhanging threat to free discussion, it must fall without regard to the facts of the particular case. This is true whether the rule of law be declared in a statute or in a decision of a court. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352. In the cases before us there was no blanket or dragnet prohibition of utterance affecting courts. Freedom to criticize their work, to assail generally \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 297]\n\u00a0\n the institution of courts, to report and comment on matters in litigation but not to subvert the process of deciding-all this freedom was respected. Only the state's interest in calm and orderly decisions, which represented also the constitutional right of the parties, led it to condemn coercive utterances directed towards a pending proceeding. California, speaking through its courts, acted because of their conclusion that such utterances undermined the conditions necessary for fair adjudication.\n It is suggested that threats, by discussion, to untrammeled decisions by courts are the most natural expressions when public feeling runs highest. But it does not follow that states are left powerless to prevent their courts from being subverted by outside pressure when the need for impartiality and fair proceeding is greatest. To say that the framers of the Constitution sanctified veiled violence through coercive speech directed against those charged with adjudication is not merely to make violence an ingredient of justice; it mocks the very ideal of justice by respecting its forms while stultifying its uncontaminated exercise.\n We turn to the specific cases before us:\n The earliest editorial involved in No. 3, 'Sit-strikers Convicted', commented upon a case the day after a jury had returned a verdict and the day before the trial judge was to pronounce sentence and hear motions for a new trial and applications for probation. On its face the editorial merely expressed exulting approval of the verdict, a completed action of the court, and there is nothing in the record to give it additional significance. The same is true of the second editorial, 'Fall of an Ex- Queen', which luridly draws a moral from a verdict of guilty in a sordid trial and which was published eight days prior to the day set for imposing sentence. In both instances imposition of sentences was immediately pending at the time of publication, but in neither case was there any declaration, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 298]\n\u00a0\n direct or sly, in regard to this. As the special guardian of the Bill of Rights this Court is under the heaviest responsibility to safeguard the liberties guaranteed from any encroachment, however astutely disguised. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to comment on a judicial proceeding, so long as this is not done in a manner interfering with the impartial disposition of a litigation. There is no indication that more was done in these editorials; they were not close threats to the judicial function which a state should be able to restrain. We agree that the judgment of the state court in this regard should not stand.\n'Probation for Gorillas?' the third editorial, is a different matter. On April 22, 1938, a Los Angeles jury found two defendants guilty of assault with a deadly weapon and of a conspiracy to violate another section of the penal code. On May 2nd, the defendants applied for probation and the trial judge on the same day set June 7th as the day for disposing of this application and for sentencing the defendants. In the Los Angeles Times for May 5th appeared the following editorial entitled 'Probation for Gorillas?':\n\n'Two members of Dave Beck's wrecking crew, entertainment committee, goon squad or gorillas, having been convicted in Superior Court of assaulting nonunion truck drivers, have asked for probation. Presumably they will say they are 'first offenders,' or plead that they were merely indulging a playful exuberance when, with slingshots, they fired steel missiles at men whose only offense was wishing to work for a living without paying tribute to the erstwhile boss of Seattle.\n\n'Sluggers for pay, like murderers for profit, are in a slightly different category from ordinary criminals. Men who commit mayhem for wages are not merely violators of the peace and dignity of the State; they are also conspirators against it. The man who burgles because his \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 299]\n\u00a0\n children are hungry may have some claim on public sympathy. He whose crime is one of impulse may be entitled to lenity. But he who hires out his muscles for the creation of disorder and in aid of a racket is a deliberate foe of organized society and should be penalized accordingly.\n\n'It will teach no lesson to other thugs to put these men on good behavior for a limited time. Their 'duty' would simply be taken over by others like them. If Beck's thugs, however, are made to realize that they face San Quentin when they are caught, it will tend to make their disreputable occupation unpopular. Judge A. A. Scott will make a serious mistake if he grants probation to Matthew Shannon and Kennan Holmes. This community needs the example of their assignment to the jute mill.'\n\n This editorial was published three days after the trial judge had fixed the time for sentencing and for passing on an application for probation, and a month prior to the date set. It consisted of a sustained attack on the defendants, with an explicit demand of the judge that they be denied probation and be sent 'to the jute mill'. This meant, in California idiom, that in the exercise of his discretion the judge should treat the offense as a felony, with all its dire consequences, and not as a misdemeanor. Under the California Penal Code the trial judge had wide discretion in sentencing the defendants: he could sentence them to the county jail for for one year or less, or to the state penitentiary for two years. The editorial demanded that he take the latter alternative and send the defendants to the 'jute mill' of the state penitentiary. A powerful newspaper admonished a judge, who within a year would have to secure popular approval if he desired continuance in office, that failure to comply with its demands would be 'a serious mistake'. Clearly, the state court was justified in treating this as a threat to impartial adjudication. It is \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 300]\n\u00a0\n too naive to suggest that the editorial was written with a feeling of impotence and an intention to utter idle words. The publication of the editorial was hardly an exercise in futility. If it is true of juries it is not wholly untrue of judges that they too may be 'impregnated by the environing atmosphere'. Mr. Justice Holmes in Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 349\n, 35 S.Ct. 582, 596. California should not be denied the right to free its courts from such coercive, extraneous influences; it can thus assure its citizens of their constitutional right of a fair trial. Here there was a real and substantial manifestation of an endeavor to exert outside influence. A powerful newspaper brought its full coercive power to bear in demanding a particular sentence. If such sentence had been imposed readers might assume that the court had been influenced in its action; if lesser punishment had been imposed, at least a portion of the community might be stirred to resentment. It cannot be denied that even a judge may be affected by such a quandary. We cannot say that the state court was out of bounds in concluding that such conduct offends the free course of justice. Comment after the imposition of sentence-criticism, however unrestrained, of its severity or lenience or disparity, cf. Ambard v. Attorney General for Trinidad and Tobago, (1936) A.C. 322,-is an exercise of the right of free discussion. But to deny the states power to check a serious attempt at dictating from without the sentence to be imposed in a pending case, is to deny the right to impartial justice as it was cherished by the founders of the Republic and by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment. It would erect into a constitutional right opportunities for abuse of utterance interfering with the dispassionate exercise of the judicial function. See Rex v. 'Daily Mail', (1921) 2 K.B. 733, 749; Attorney General v. Tonks, (1939) N.Z.L.R. 533.\n In No. 1, Harry R. Bridges challenges a judgment by the Superior Court of California fining him $125 for con- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 301]\n\u00a0\n tempt. He was president of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, as affiliate of the Committee for Industrial Organization, and also West Coast director for the C.I.O. The I.L.W.U. was largely composed of men who had withdrawn from the International Longshoreman's Association, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. In the fall of 1937 the rival longshoremen's unions were struggling for control of a local in San Pedro Harbor. The officers of this local, carrying most of its members with them, sought to transfer the allegiance of the local to I.L.W.U. Thereupon, longshoremen remaining in I.L.A. brought suit in the Superior Court of Los Angeles county against the local and its officers. On January 21, 1938, Judge Schmidt, sitting in the Superior Court, enjoined the officers from working on behalf of I.L.W.U. and appointed a receiver to conduct the affairs of the local as an affiliate of the A.F. of L., by taking charge of the outstanding bargaining agreements of the local and of its hiring hall, which is the physical mainstay of such a union. Judge Schmidt promptly stayed enforcement of his decree, and on January 24th the defendants in the injunction suit moved for a new trial and for vacation of the judgment. In view of its local setting, the case aroused great public interest. The waterfront situation on the Pacific Coast was also watched by the United States Department of Labor, and Bridges had been in communication with the Secretary of Labor concerning the difficulties. On the same day that the motion for new trial was filed, Bridges sent the Secretary the following wire concerning Judge Schmidt's decree:\n'This decision is outrageous considering I.L.A. has 15 members (in San Pedro) and the International Longshoremen-Warehousemen's housemen's Union has 3000. International Longshoremen-Warehousemen Union has petitioned the Labor Board for certification to represent San \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 302]\n\u00a0\n Pedro longshoremen with International Longshoremen Association denied representation because it represents only 15 men. Board hearing held; decision now pending. Attempted enforcement of Schmidt decision will tie up port of Los Angeles and involve entire Pacific Coast. International Longshoremen-Warehousemen Union, representing over 11,000 of the 12,000 longshoremen on the Pacific Coast, does not intend to allow state courts to override the majority vote of members in choosing its officers and representatives and to override the National Labor Relations Board.'\n\n This telegram duly found its way into the metropolitan newspapers of California. Bridges' responsibility for its publication is clear. His publication of the telegram in the Los Angeles and San Francisco papers is the basis of Bridges' conviction for contempt.\n The publication of the telegram was regarded by the state supreme court as 'a threat that if an attempt was made to enforce the decision, the ports of the entire Pacific Coast would be tied up' and 'a direct challenge to the court that 11,000 longshoremen on the Pacific Coast would not abide by its decision'. This occurred immediately after counsel had moved to set aside the judgment which was criticized, so unquestionably there was a threat to litigation obviously alive. It would be inadmissible dogmatism for us to say that in the context of the immediate case-the issues at stake, the environment in which the judge, the petitioner and the community were moving, the publication here made, at the time and in the manner it was made-this could not have dominated the mind of the judge before whom the matter was pending. Here too the state court's judgment should not be overturned.\n The fact that the communication to the Secretary of Labor may have been privileged does not constitutionally protect whatever extraneous use may have been made \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 303]\n\u00a0\n of the communication. It is said that the possibility of a strike, in case of an adverse ruling, must in any event have suggested itself to the private thoughts of a sophisticated judge. Therefore the publication of the Bridges telegram, we are told, merely gave that possibility public expression. To afford constitutional shelter for a definite attempt at coercing a court into a favorable decision because of the contingencies of frustration to which all judicial action is subject, is to hold, in effect, that the Constitution subordinates the judicial settlement of conflicts to the unfettered indulgence of violent speech. The mere fact that after an unfavorable decision men may, upon full consideration of their responsibilities as well as their rights, engage in a strike or a lockout, is a poor reason for denying a state the power to protect its courts from being bludgeoned by serious threats while a decision is hanging in the judicial balance. A vague, undetermined possibility that a decision of a court may lead to a serious manifestation of protest is one thing. The impact of a definite threat of action to prevent a decison is a wholly different matter. To deny such realities is to stultify law. Rights must be judged in their context and not in vacuo. Compare Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194, 205\n, 25 S.Ct. 3, 5; Badders v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 391, 393\n, 394 S., 36 S.Ct. 367, 368; American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Bank, \n256 \nU.S. 350, 358\n, 41 S.Ct. 499, 500, 25 A.L.R. 971. 'All rights are derived from the purposes of the society in which they exist; above all rights rises duty to the community.' Mr. Justice Brandeis in Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 488\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 184, 16 A.L.R. 196.\n The question concerning the narrow power we recognize always is-was there a real and substantial threat to the impartial decision by a court of a case actively pending before it? The threat must be close and direct; it must be directed towards a particular litigation. The litigation must be immediately pending. When a case is pending is \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 304]\n\u00a0\n not a technical, lawyer's problem, but is to be determined by the substantial realities of the specific situation. \n8\n Danger of unbridled exercise of judicial power because of immunity from speech which is coercing is a figment of groundless fears. In addition to the internal censor of conscience, professional standards, the judgment of fellow judges and the bar, the popular judgment exercised in elections, the power of appellate courts, including this Court, there is the corrective power of the press and of public comment free to assert itself fully immediately upon completion of judicial conduct. Because courts, like other agencies, may at times exercise power arbitrarily and have done so, resort to this Court is open to determine whether, under the guise of protecting impartiality in specific litigation, encroachments have been made upon th eliberties of speech and press. But instances of past arbitrariness afford no justification for reversing the course of history and denying the states power to continue to use time-honored safeguards to assure unbullied adjudications. All experience justifies the states in acting upon the conviction that a wrong decision in a particular case may best be forestalled or corrected by more rational means than coercive intrusion from outside the judicial process.\n Since courts, although representing the law, United States v. Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563, 574\n, 27 S.Ct. 165, 166, 8 Ann.Cas. 265, are also sitting in judgment, as it were, on their own function in exercising their power to punish for contempt, it should be used only in flagrant cases and with the utmost forbearance. It is al- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 252, 305]\n\u00a0\n ways better to err on the side of tolerance and even of disdainful indifference.\n No objections were made before us to the procedure by which the charges of contempt were tried. But it is proper to point out that neither case was tried by a judge who had participated in the trials to which the publications referred. Compare Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517, 539\n, 45 S.Ct. 390, 395. So it is clear that a disinterested tribunal was furnished, and since the Constitution does not require a state to furnish jury trials, Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581\n, 20 S.Ct. 448, 494; Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 324\n, 58 S.Ct. 149, 151, and states have discretion in fashioning criminal remedies, Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141\n, 60 S.Ct. 879, 130 A.L.R. 1321, the situation here is the same as though a state had made it a crime to publish utterance having a \"reasonable tendency' to interfere with the orderly administration of justice in pending actions', and not dissimilar from what the United States has done in  135 of the Criminal Code. \n9\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bridges v. Superior Court, 14 Cal.2d 464, 94 P.2d 983; Times-Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, 15 Cal.2d 99, 98 P.2d 1029. In the Times-Mirror case, the affidavits of complaint contained seven counts, each based upon the publication of a different editorial. The Superior Court for Los Angeles County sustained a demurrer to two of the counts, and of the five remaining counts on which conviction rested, the California Supreme Court affirmed as to three, reversed as to two. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See The Times-Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 15 Cal.2d at page 118, 98 P.2d at page 1040, where the following is quoted with approval: 'Liberty of the press is subordinate to the independence of the judiciary ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Indeed, the only evidence we have of the California legislature's appraisal indicates approval of a policy directly contrary to that here followed by the California courts. For Section 1209, subsection 13, of the California Code of Civil Procedure (1937 Ed.) provides: '... no speech or publication reflecting upon or concerning any court or any officer thereof shall be treated or punished as a contempt of such court unless made in the immediate presence of such court while in session and in such a manner as to actually interfere with its proceedings.' The California Supreme Court's decision that the statute is invalid under the California constitution is an authoritative determination of that point. But the inferences as to the legislature's appraisal of the danger arise from the enactment, and are therefore unchanged by the subsequent judicial treatment of the statute. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Schenck v.

It explicitly stated that 'all publications out of court ... concerning any cause pending before any court of this commonwealth, shall not be construed into a contempt of the said court, so as to render the author, printer, publisher, or either of them, liable to attachment and summary punishment for the same.'

The italics are ours. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Compare the following statements from letters of Thomas Jefferson as set out in Padover, Democracy, 150-151: 'I deplore ... the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who write them. ... These ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste.\n'It is however an evil for which there is no remedy, our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The whole editorial, published in The Los Angeles Times of May 5, 1938, was as follows:\n'Two members of Dave Beck's wrecking crew, entertainment committee, goon squad or gorillas, having been convicted in Superior Court of assaulting nonunion truck drivers, have asked for probation. Presumably they will say they are 'first offenders,' or plead that they were merely indulging a playful exuberance when, with slingshots, they fired steel missiles at men whose only offense was wishing to work for a living without paying tribute to the erstwhile boss of Seattle.\n\n'Sluggers for pay, like murderers for profit, are in a slightly different category from ordinary criminals. Men who commit mayhem for wages are not merely violators of the peace and dignity of the State; they are also conspirators against it. The man who burgles because his children are hungry may have some claim on public sympathy. He whose crime is one of impulse may be entitled to lenity. But he who hires out his muscles for the creation of disorder and in aid of a racket is a deliberate foe of organized society and should be penalized accordingly.\n\n'It will teach no lesson to other thugs to put these men on good behavior for a limited time. Their 'duty' would simply be taken over by others like them. If Beck's thugs, however, are made to realize that they face San Quentin when they are caught, it will tend to make their disreputable occupation unpopular. Judge A. A. Scott will make a serious mistake if the grants probation to Matthew Shannon and Kennan Holmes. This community needs the example of their assignment to the jute mill.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Cf. Times-Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 15 Cal.2d at pages 109, 110, 98 P.2d at page 1035: 'The editorial may not have been intended, but it is capable of being construed, as a notice to the trial judge that no leniency should be extended to the convicted men, and, furthermore, that should the court act contrary to the suggestions contained in the editorial, it might well expect adverse criticism in the columns of The Times.' Although the foregoing statement was made with respect to another of the editorials, the opinion of the California Supreme Court later said it was applicable to 'Probation for Gorillas?'. Id., 15 Cal.2d at pages 114, 115, 98 P.2d at page 1038. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The first of these editorials, entitled 'Sit-Strikers Convicted', was published in the Los Angeles Times of December 21, 1937, the day after the jury had returned a verdict that the 'sit-strikers' in question were guilty, and the day before the trial judge was to hold court for the purpose of pronouncing sentence, hearing motions for a new trial, and passing upon applications for probation. The editorial follows in its entirety:\n'The verdict of a jury finding guilty the twenty-two sit-strikers who led the assault on the Douglas plant last February, will have reverberations up and down the Pacific Coast and in points farther east.\n\n'The verdict means that Los Angeles is still Los Angeles, that the city is aroused to the danger of davebeckism, and that no kind of union terrorism will be permitted here.\n\n'The verdict may have a good deal to do with sending Dave Beck back to Seattle. For, while the United Automobile Workers have no connection with Beck, their tactics and his are identical in motive; and if Beck can be convinced that this kind of warfare is not permitted in this area he will necessarily abandon his dreams of conquest.\n\n'Already the united farmers and ranchers have given Beck a severe setback. The Hynes hay market is still free and it has been made plain that interference with milk deliveries to Los Angeles will not be tolerated.\n\n'Dist. Atty. Fitts pledged his best efforts to prevent and punish union terrorism and racketeering in a strong radio address, and followed it up yesterday with a statement congratulating the jury that convicted the sit-downers and the community on one of the 'most farreaching verdicts in the history of this country.'\n\n'In this he is correct. It is an important verdict. For the first time since the present cycle of labor disturbances began, union lawlessness has been treated as exactly what it is, an offense against the public peace punishable like any other crime.\n\n'The seizure of property by a militant minority, which arrogated to itself the right of dictating not only to employers, but to other workers \n\n who played ball with her. From small beginnings she utilized every opportunity to extned her influence and to put officeholders and promising political material under obligations to her. She became a power in the backstage councils of city and county affairs and from that place of strategic advantage reached out to pull the strings on State and legislative offices as well.\n'Those were the days when Mrs. Werner was 'Queen Helen' and it is only fair to say that to her the power was much more important than the perquisites. When the inevitable turning of the political wheel brought new figures to the front and new bosses to the back, she found her grip slipping and it was hard to take. The several cases which in recent years have brought her before the courts to defend her activities seem all examples of an energetic effort to regain and reassert her onetime influence in high places. That it should ultimately have landed her behind the bars as a convicted bribe-seeker is not illogical. But if there is logic in it, the money meant less to Mrs. Werner than the name of still being a political power, one who could do things with public officials that others could not do. To herself at least she was still Queen Helen.' \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The portions of the telegram published in newspapers of general circulation in San Francisco and Los Angeles on January 24 and 25, 1938, were as follows:\n'This decision is outrageous considering I.L.A. has 15 members (in San Pedro) and the International Longshoremen-Warehousemen Union has 3000. International Longshoremen-Warehousemen Union has petitioned the labor board for certification to represent San Pedro \n\n longshoremen with International Longshoremen Association denied representation because it represents only 15 men. Board hearing held; decision now pending; Attempted enforcement of Schmidt decision will tie- up port of Los Angeles and involve entire Pacific Coast. International Longshoremen-Warehousemen Union, representing over 11,000 of the 12,000 longshoremen on the Pacific Coast, does not intend to allow state courts to override the majority vote of members in choosing its officers and representatives and to override the National Labor Relations Board.' \n[\nFootnote 21\n] See Bridges v. Superior Court, supra, 14 Cal.2d at page 493, 94 P. 2d 983. Cf. White v. Nicholls, 3 How. 266. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Certain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution. ... To fine for contempt- imprison for contumacy-inforce the observance of order, &c. are powers which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others'. United States v. Hudson, 1812, 7 Cranch 32, 34.\n That 'the safety of the people is the supreme law,' not only comports with, but is indispensable to, the exercise of those powers in their public functionaries, without which that safety cannot be guarded. On this principle it is, that courts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation, with power to impose silence, respect and decorum in their presence, and submission to their lawful mandates, and as a corollary to this proposition, to preserve themselves and their officers from the approach and insults of pollution.\n'It is true, that the courts of justice of the United States are vested, by express statute provision, with power to fine and imprison for contempts; but it does not follow, from this circumstance, that they would not have exercised that power, without the aid of the statute, or not in cases, if such should occur, to which such statute provision may not extend; on the contrary, it is a legislative assertion of this right, as incidental to a grant of judicial power, and can only be considered only as an instance of abundant caution, or a legislative declaration, that the power of punishing for contempt shall not extend beyond its known and acknowledged limits of fine and imprisonment.' Anderson v. Dunn, 1821, 6 Wheat. 204, 227, 228.\n\n'The power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts; its existence is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders, and writs of the courts, and consequently to the due administration of justice. The moment the courts of the United States were called into existence and invested with jurisdiction over any subject, they became possessed of this power.' Ex parte Robinson, 1874, 19 Wall. 505, 510.\n\n'The act of 1789 did not define what were contempts of the authority of the courts of the United States in any cause or hearing before them, nor did it prescribe any special procedure for determining a matter of contempt. Under that statute the question whether particular acts constituted a contempt, as well as the mode of proceeding against the offender, was left to be determined according to such established rules and principles of the common law as were applicable to our situation.' Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, 1889, \n131 \nU.S. 267, 275\n, 276 S., 9 S.Ct. 699, 701. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For the history leading up to the Pennsylvania legislation, see Respublica v. Oswald, 1788, 1 Dall. 319, particularly note beginning at page 329; Respublica v. Passmore, 3 Yeates, Pa., 441, 2 Am. Dec. 388; Hamilton, Report of the Trial and Acquittal of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (1805). Cf. Hollingsworth v. Duane, Fed.Cas. No.6,616, Wall.Sr. 77; United States v. Duane, Fed.Cas.No.14,997, Wall.Sr. 102. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The charge against Judge Peck was that he punished counsel for contempt after the final decree of the particular litigation had been rendered and the necessary steps for an appeal had been taken, and after the judge had published his opinion in a newspaper and plaintiff in reply had submitted to the public 'a concise statement of some of the principal errors into which your petitioner (the accused counsel) had fallen'. Stansbury, Report of the Trial of James H. Peck (1833). In view of their immediate professional responsibility, the eminent lawyers who had charge of the impeachment proceedings against Judge Peck would naturally take the least tolerant view of the power of courts to punish for contempt. Yet all the managers of the House of Representatives (James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, George E. McDuffie of South Carolina, Ambrose Spencer and Henry Storrs of New York, Charles E. Wickliffe of Kentucky) acknowledged the historic power to punish interferences calculated to obstruct the exercise of the judicial function in a pending cause. They did so substantially in the terms now here challenged. Ibid., pp. 91, 291, 293, 382, 400. The following from Mr. Storrs' argument is a fair sample:\n'The law of contempts, when confined to the protection of the courts in their proper constitutional action and duties, and to the punishment of every direct or indirect interference with the exercise of their powers and the protection of those who are concerned in them as parties, jurors, witnesses and officers of justice in aid of the administration of their functions, was too well established and too well sustained by principle as well as positive law, to be doubted or disturbed; and, confined to its proper limits, admitted of all reasonable certainty in its definitions of crime. But if extended to the case of general libel, there was no security for personal liberty but the discretion or feeling of a judge.' Ibid., p. 400. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is relevant to add that this expressed the view of Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandeis whose opinions have had such a powerful influence in pressing the Due Process Clause to the service of freedom of speech and of the press. In two earlier cases of summary punishment for contempt they strongly dissented because they found that the limits set by the Act of 1831 had been exceeded. Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402\n, 38 S.Ct. 560, and Craig v. Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255\n, 44 S.Ct. 103. But in neither case did they suggest any constitutional difficulty in the exercise of the contempt power arising from the prohibition of the First Amendment. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See the Lincoln Day, 1898, address of Mr. Justice Brewer, Government by Injunction, 15 Nat.Corp.Rep. 848, 849: 'It is a mistake to suppose that the Supreme Court is either honored or helped by being spoken of as beyond criticism. On the contrary, the life and character of its justices should be the objects of constant watchfulness by all, and its judgments subject to the freest criticism. The time is past in the history of the world when any living man or body of men can be set on a pedestal and decorated with a halo. True, many criticisms may be, like their authors, devoid of good taste, but better all sorts of criticism than no criticism at all. The moving waters are full of life and health; only in the still waters is stagnation and death.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'It is most important that the administration of justice in this country should not be hampered as it is hampered in some other countries, and it is not enlarging the jurisdiction of this court-it is refusing to narrow the jurisdiction of this court-when we say that we are determined while we are here to do nothing to substitute in this country trial by newspaper for trial by jury; and those who attempt to introduce that system in in this country, even in its first beginnings, must be prepared to suffer for it. Probably the proper punishment-and it is one which this court may yet have to award if the punishment we are about to award proves insufficient-will be imprisonment in cases of this kind. There is no question about that, because we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that newspapers are owned by wealthy people, and it may even happen that they will take the chances of the fine and pay it cheerfully and will not feel that they have then paid too much for the advertisement.'

Clarke, 103 L.T.R., N.S., 636, 640. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Thus, in England, the 'third degree' never gained a foothold, and its emergence was impressively resisted long before it was outlawed here.

DEWAR(1941)\nNo. 718\nArgued: May 1, 1941Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Milton B. Badt, of Elko, Nev., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondents brought suit in a Nevada District Court to enjoin the petitioner from barring, or threatening to bar, them from grazing their investock within Nevada Grazing District No. 1 in default of the payment of certain grazing fees and in default of their holding a license permitting such use of the public lands by them. The bill alleged that the respondents were, and for years had been, in the business of breeding, raising, grazing, and selling livestock within Nevada and within the district; that it was impossible for them to own or lease all the land needed for their business and they owned or leased a small portion of the required land and used vacant unappropriated and unreserved public lands of the United States to satisfy the remainder of their grazing requirements; that their financial and business necessities made it impossible to continue to operate if their ability to graze their livestock on the public range were seriously impaired or interfered with. They averred that, until May 31, 1955, they had been impliedly li- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n censed by the United States to graze livestock on portions of the public range in Nevada. \n1\n They recited the passage by Congress of an Act of June 28, 1934,2 and alleged that, on April 8, 1935, the Secretary of the Interior, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, established a grazing district known as Nevada Grazing District No. 1, which included portions of the public range upon which the respondents had theretofore grazed their livestock and that, on May 31, 1935, the Director of Grazing, with the approval of the Secretary, had promulgated rules which required all persons grazing within the district to obtain temporary licenses so to do, for which no fees were to be paid; that pursuant to the rules, the respondents obtained temporary licenses; that, on March 2, 1936. After an investigation by the Secretary, the Director of Grazing, with the approval of his superior, purporting to act under the authority of  2 of the Act of June 28, 1934, promulgated rules for the administration of grazing districts, which provided for the issue of temporary licenses to expire on a date named in 1937 or upon the issue of permits provided for by  3 of the Act, for which licenses graziers were to pay a fee of five cents per month for each head of cattle and a fee of one cent per month for each head of sheep for the privilege of grazing; that the rules further provided that, after issue of the temporary licenses, no stockman should graze livestock upon, nor drive them across, the public range within a grazing district without a license. The complaint recited that, about May 1, 1936, the respondents were notified by the Register of the District Land Office that licenses would be granted them upon payment of the first installment of the grazing fees and that \n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n shortly thereafter the defendant, Brooks, who was acting as Regional Grazier of the United States, notified the respondents that unless they paid the installments and obtained licenses by June 15th they would be considered in trespass under the terms of the Act of 1934 and would be punished by fine as provided in the Act. The respondents alleged with particularity the urgent necessity in the conduct of their business that they be permitted in graze their cattle to public lands and that, unless they can do so, they will suffer irreparable and serious damage due to the destruction of their bus nesses. The bill charges that although the Secretary in promulgating the rules with respect to temporary licenses purported to act under the authority of  2 of the Act of 1934, that section confers upon him no power so to do and that grazing fees specified by the rules were fixed without any attempt to determine their amounts as required by  3 of the Act and in violation of conditions prescribed by  3.\n The petitioner demurred and assigned as reasons that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him; that there was a defect of parties defendant for failure to join the Secretary of the Interior; that as the United States, an indispensable party, had not consented to be sued, the court was without jurisdiction; and that the subject matter of the complaint was exclusively within the political power of the United States and not subject to judicial review. The court overruled the demurrer, with leave to answer. The petitioner elected to stand upon his demurrer and the court thereupon entered a decree in favor of the respondents, which the Supreme Court of Nevada affirmed. \n3\n We granted certiorari, \n312 \nU.S. 674\n, 61 S.Ct. 738, 85 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the questions involved.\n By  1 of the Act of 1934, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to establish grazing districts not exceeding \n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n in the aggregate an area of 80,000,000 acres out of certain unappropriated and unreserved public lands of the United States4 if the lands, in his opinion, are chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops. Before any district is created a hearing is to be held after notice at which officials and persons interested are to be heard. Section 2 provides:\n'The Secretary of the Interior shall make provision for the protection, administration, regulation, and improvement of such grazing districts as may be created under the authority of the foregoing section, and he shall make such rules and regulations and establish such service, enter into such cooperative agreements, and do any and all things necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act (chapter) and to insure the objects of such grazing districts, namely, to regulate their occupancy and use, to preserve the land and its resources from destruction or unnecessary injury, to provide for the orderly use, improvement, and development of the range; ... and any willful violation of the provisions of this Act (chapter) or of such rules and regulations thereunder after actual notice thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500.'\n\n Section 3 authorizes the Secretary to issue permits to graze livestock in grazing districts 'upon the payment annually of reasonable fees in each case to be fixed or determined from time to time.' It commands that preference be given, in the issue of permits, to certain persons described in the section and that no permittee who complies with the rules and regulations of the Secretary shall be denied the renewal of his permit if such denial will impair the value of the permittee's grazing unit when such unit is pledged as security for any bona fide loan. The permits are to be for a period of not more \n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n than ten years subject to the preferential right of the permittee to renewal in the discretion of the Secretary. There are other provisions for adjustment of the amount of grazing to be permitted under the permits and a corresponding adjustment of the grazing fees in the case of the occurrence of range depletion due to natural causes.\n By  10 it is provided that all moneys received under the authority of he Act are to be deposited in the Treasury of the United States and twenty-five per cent. of such moneys received from any district in a fiscal year is made available, when appropriated by the Congress, for expenditure by the Secretary for range improvements and fifty per cent. of such money received from a district in any fiscal year is to be paid, at the end of the year, by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the state in which the grazing district issituated to be expended by the state for the benefit of the counties in which the district lies. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner asserts that the judgment below should be reversed because the suit is one against the United States; because the Secretary of the Interior is an indispensable party, and because the State court was without power to enjoin a federal officer. He admits that earlier cases in this court are against his contention but relies on others which he says sustain his view. As this Court remarked nearly sixty years ago respecting questions of this kind, they 'have rarely been free from difficulty' and it is not 'an easy matter to reconcile all the decisions of the court in this class of cases.' \n6\n The statement applies with equal force at this day. We are not disposed to attempt a critique of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n authorities. Since the jurisdiction and the procedure of the court below is sustained by decisions of this Court, we are unwilling to base our judgment upon a resolution of asserted conflict touching issues of so grave consequence where, as here, the bill fails to make a case upon the merits.\n The respondents say that, under the Act of 1934, the Secretary is powerless to grant temporary licenses and charge fees therefor; that his sole authority is to issue permanent permits for specified periods not to exceed ten years, at fees adjusted to the circumstances of individual permittees, and with preferential rights of renewal. If this view be correct it might well be years before the Secretary could place the users of lands in any district under permits. The petitioner asserts that it was not the intent of Congress that the grazing lands should go unregulated and without license for any such extensive period as would be required for the issue of permits under  3. He relies on the broad powers conferred by  2 and points out that the section is a replica of the statute involved in United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S.Ct. 480, and there held to authorize similar rules and regulations.\n With knowledge that the Department of the Interior was issuing temporary licenses instead of term permits and that uniform fees were being charged and collected for the issue of temporary licenses, Congress repeatedly appropriated twenty-five per cent. of the money thus coming into the Treasury for expenditure by the Secretary in improvements upon the ranges. \n7\n The information in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n the possession of Congress was plentiful and from various sources. It knew from the annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior that a system of temporary licensing was in force. \n8\n The same information was furnished the Appropriations Committee at its hearings. \n9\n Not only was it disclosed by the annual report of the Department that no permits were issued in 1936, 1937, and 1938, and that permits were issued in only one district in 1939, but it was also disclosed in the hearings that uniform fees were being charged and collected for the issue of temporary licenses. And members from the floor informed the Congress that the temporary licensing system was in force and that as much as $1,000,000 had been or would be collected in fees for such licenses. \n10\n The repeated appropriations of the proceeds f the fees thus covered and to be covered into the Treasury, not only confirms the departmental construction of the statute,11 but constitutes a ratification of the action of the Secretary as the agent of Congress in the administration of the act. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded with directions. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Buford v.

Stern, Carol King, and Walter H. Pollak, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and John T. Cahill, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the use by an American citizen of a passport obtained by false statements to facilitate reentry into the United States is a 'use' within section 2 of the Passport Title of the Act of June 15, 1917,1 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n and, if so, whether petitioner was properly convicted of a 'willful' use. We brought the case here because of its importance in the administration of the passport laws.\n Section 2 provides that whoever shall either make a false statement in an application for a passport or 'shall willfully and knowingly use ... any passport the issue of which was secured in any way by reason of any false statement, shall be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years or both.' The indictment in two counts charged that petitioner, having secured a passport by a false statement, willfully and knowingly used it on April 30, 1937, and again on February 15, 1938, each time by presenting it to an immigration inspector to gain entry into the United States. The proof showed that petitioner, a native-born American citizen, had in 1921, 1927 and 1931 obtained passports under different assumed names by means of false statements. In 1934 petitioner applied for a passport in his own name. The application blank contained the clause: 'My last passport was obtained from ...... and is submitted herewith for cancellation.' Despite the three passports previously issued to him, petitioner wrote 'none' in the blank space, then signed the application and swore to the truth of its contents. The Government issued him a passport which was later extended upon a renewal application until September 1, 1938. Returning from Europe in April, 1937, and again in February, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n 1938, petitioner showed his passport to an inspector to identify himself and establish his citizenship and consequent right to reenter the United States. The jury convicted him on both counts for willfully using a passport secured by a false statement, and the District Court sentenced him to two years' imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 on each count, the terms to run consecutively. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n At the time of the indictment, the statute of limitations had run on the obtaining of the passport by a false statement, 18 U.S.C.  582, 18 U.S.C. A.  582.\n Petitioner contends that the indictment is for the 'use' 'of a passport as truthful proof of his Kansas birth.' Since the 'use' to prove an admitted fact-his American citizenship-was innocent, it is urged, no statutory prohibition was violated. The indictment, however, charges that petitioner 'used ... a passport ... the issue of which he secured by reason of a false statement ... in the application therefor.' The language of the indictment conforms to the definition of the offense in the statute, as the use of 'any passport the issue of which was secured in any way by reason of any false statement.' The balanced form of section 2, quoted above at note 1, shows that the Congress viewed with concern and punished with equal severity the securing of passports by false statements and their use. The crimes denounced are not the securing or the use but either of such actions made criminal only by the false statements in the procurement of the passport. If the misrepresentation is withdrawn nothing culpable remains in the use. A condemned use of a passport secured by the fraud seems obviously within the act.\n A more difficult issue emerges from petitioner's assertion that the use proven here is not the kind of use covered by the statute. He finds the prohibitions di- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 338]\n\u00a0\n rected against 'dishonest uses of the safe-conduct of the United States in foreign relations.' Such use must be 'willful and knowing,' an expression said to bear the connotation of evil or dishonest. Attention is called to alleged passport frauds of about the time of the passage of the passport sections and to the recommendation of the Attorney General that Congress pass legislation against the fraudulent use of passports. \n3\n These are brought forward as indicative of the purpose of Congress to punish fraudulent uses or those uses abroad which would involve misuse of the privilege, under international law, of traveling through foreign countries.\n It is quite true that passports are used chiefly in foreign travel. There is no limitation, however, to that field and surely the close connection between foreign travel and reentry to this country is obvious. The plain meaning of the words of the act covers this use. No single argument has more weight in statutory interpretation than this. \n4\n Nothing in the legislative history is brought to our attention which indicates any other purpose in Congress than that expressed by the words of the act. The final form of the enactment did not vary in this particular portion from the bill originally introduced. \n5\n The Government does not urge that every use of a fraudulent passport is violative of the act but only those 'uses in connection with travel which are a part of the ordinary incentives for obtaining passports.' Certainly the use to prove citizenship on reentry to the country is within the ordinary incentives. 6 It is en- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 339]\n\u00a0\n tirely clear from the record that passports were customarily used to prove the bearer's citizenship on reentry into the United States at the time of this alleged offense. The use of a passport for reentry is now routine, although neither at the time of the passage of the act nor at present are passports required of citizens on reentry. Our conclusion is not weakened by the fact that the Act of May 22, 1918,7 which required citizens to use passports to depart from or enter the United States, was permitted to expire after the war emergency. While passports no longer were required for reentry, their use for that purpose afterwards became both convenient and customary.\n The fact that at the time of the passage of the act, passports were not customarily used by citizens to assure easy reentry is brought forward by petitioner to support the argument that Congress did not intend to punish uses such as the one charged here. There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress considered the question of use by returning citizens. Old crimes, however, may be committed under new conditions. Old laws apply to changed situations. \n8\n The reach of the act is not sustained or opposed by the fact that it is sought to bring new situations under its terms. \n9\n While a statute \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 340]\n\u00a0\n speaks from its enactment, even a criminal statute embraces everything which subsequently falls within its scope. \n10\n The use here charged under these tests was clearly within the scope of the act. The purpose of this act was to punish the use of passports obtained by false statements.\n There is the further contention that the Government's construction of the word 'use' would make criminal, under other sections of the act, the presentation of expired passports for the purpose of identifying citizens returning from Mexico, Bermuda and Canada. Petitioner urges that such uses, though frequent and apparently acquiesced in by the authorities, would then violate section 3, 22 U.S.C.A.  221, which prohibits a use 'in violation of the conditions or restrictions therein contained,' and also section 4, 22 U.S.C.A.  222, which prohibits the use of a passport 'validly issued which has become void by the occurrence of any condition therein prescribed invalidating the same.' The question of the meaning of other sections is not before us. Considered solely from the standpoint of their analogy to section 2, the use of expired passports to identify the holder seems entirely different from the use of a passport obtained by false statements. The vice in the latter is congenital. Its willful use is prohibited.\n Petitioner points out, however, that the use must be 'willfully and knowingly.c that the use must be 'willfully and knowingly.' is dishonest in addition to or apart from the dishonesty in obtaining the passport, and which is in itself evil 'as the use of a passport to invoke fraudulently the protection of the United States abroad.' Further it is said this evil must be the kind of evil within the spirit and intendment of the act. But the statute plainly does \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 341]\n\u00a0\n not purport to punish fraudulent or dishonest use other than such as is involved in the use of a passport dishonestly obtained. None of its words suggest that fraudulent use is an element of the crime. The statute is aimed at the protection of the integrity of United States passports. It penalizes both procuring the passport by a false statement and its use when so procured. The crime of 'use' is complete when the passport so obtained is used willfully and knowingly.\n Read in its context the phrase 'willfully and knowingly,' as the trial court charged the jury, can be taken only as meaning 'deliberately and with knowledge and not something which is merely careless or negligent or inadvertent.' No exception was taken to this instruction. The point at issue arises because a motion was denied to dismiss the indictment on the ground that 'the government's case is fatally defective in that it lacks the main essential ingredient of the entire case; namely, the criminal intent of the defendant at the time of the alleged act'; that there is 'no proof that there was a knowing and willful use to gain entry.' Petitioner relies upon United States v. Murdock. \n11\n That case affirmed a reversal of conviction for a violation of section 1114(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 and a like section of the 1928 act (section 146(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, pages 324 and 402. These sections made it a misdemeanor for a taxpayer to 'willfully' fail to supply information in regard to income. The taxpayer refused the information on the ground of privilege from fear of self-incrimination. At the time the law upon the point was uncertain. This reasonable fear, this Court held, entitled the taxpayer to requested instruction on his good faith in refusing to answer. This claim of constitutional right is quite different from the claim here of a right to use a passport obtained by false representation, contrary \n\n[312 \nU.S. 335, 342]\n\u00a0\n to the express words of the statute, because there was no ulterior evil purpose in mind. The Murdock opinion recognizes, 290 U.S. at page 394, 54 S.Ct. at page 225, that the word 'willful' often denotes an intentional as distinguished from an accidental act. Once the basic wrong under this passport statute is completed, that is the securing of a passport by a false statement, any intentional use of that passport in travel is punishable.\n Other suggestions as a basis for reversal are made. These do not require particular comment.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 217, 227, Title IX, 22 U.S.C.A.  220: 'Sec. 2.

Flagler died on May 20, 1913. Petitioners are legatees under a testamentary trust created under his will. The trust continued for a period of ten years from his death and terminated on May 20, 1923. As of that time the trustees delivered to petitioners1 certain securities which were sold by them in 1934 and 1936. The question presented is whether the basis for computing gain or loss on such sales under  113(a)(5) of the Revenue Acts of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, and 19362, 49 Stat. 1648, is the value of the securities when delivered to the legatees or their value on the date of death of the decedent. Petitioners make substantially the same \n\n[313 \nU.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n argument for application of the former criterion as did respondent in Helvering v. Reynolds, No. 684, \n313 \nU.S. 428\n, 61 S.Ct. 971, decided this day. And they contend that under Florida law they had at the date of death only contingent interests. But assuming they are correct in the latter contention, it is of no avail. For the reasons stated in Helvering v. Reynolds, supra, the proper basis was the value of the securities at the death of the decedent. Accordingly, the judgments of the court below (2 Cir., 116 F.2d 800) must be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent for the reasons stated in their dissent in Helvering v. Reynolds, No. 684, 311 U.S. --, 61 S.Ct. 971, decided this day. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Some securities had previously been delivered to Harry Harkness Flagler, petitioner in No. 735, on April 26, 1921.

COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA(1941)\nNo. 676\nArgued: April 2, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. Gray Williams, of Winchester, Va., and Clarence E. Martin, of Martinsburg, W. Va., for appellant.\n Mr. Abram P. Staples, of Richmond, Va., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, a corporation of West Virginia, has its principal office and place of business in Martinsburg in that State. As a foreign corporation registered in Virginia it has paid the latter State an annual re istration fee and an income tax on its net profits allocable to its \n\n[313 \nU.S. 117, 118]\n\u00a0\n Virginia business. It makes bread which it sells to grocers and other retailers in territory adjacent to Martinsburg including Winchester and other places in Virginia. Appellant's trucks carry the bread into Virginia where they serve regular routes at regular intervals. The drivers call only on regular customers, inquire of each how much bread he needs and, in response to his order, take it from the truck and deliver it to the customer. Thus each such transaction in Virginia is a sale and delivery in that State to a regular customer.\n The company has no property permanently located in Virginia and no place of business in the State, except that, as required by the statute respecting registered foreign corporations, it maintains an office in the State where claims against it may be audited, settled, and paid.\n The appellant was convicted for making a sale in Virginia without having procured a license pursuant to  192b1 of the Tax Code of Virginia, and a fine was imposed. The Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n So far as material the statute provides: 'There is hereby imposed an annual State license tax on every person, firm and corporation (other than ... a manufacturer taxable on capital by this State, or a distributor of manufactured goods paying a State license tax on his purchases) who or which shall peddle goods, wares or merchandise by selling and delivering the same at the same time to licensed dealers or retailers at other than a definite place of business operated by the seller. Provided, however, this act shall not be construed to apply to wholesale dealers regularly licensed by this State, and who shall at the same time sell and deliver merchandise \n\n[313 \nU.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n to retail merchants.' The annual fee is $100 for each vehicle used in the business.\n It is admitted that appellant was not a manufacturer taxable on its capital stock, nor a distributor of manufactured products paying a state license tax on its purchases, nor a licensed wholesale dealer, and did not, therefore, come within any of the classes exempted by the Act.\n In the State courts, and here, the appellant challenged the statute as contravening the commerce clause and the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution. Its position is that it is doing either an interstate business which the State may not burden by imposing a license tax, or an intrastate business as to which the exaction works a forbidden discrimination. We hold both contentions untenable.\n\n 1. \nWhile the transportation of bread across the State line is interstate commerce, that is not the activity which is licensed or taxed. The purely local business of peddling is what the Act hits, and this irrespective of the source of the goods sold. It is settled that such a statute imposes no burden upon interstate commerce which the Constitution interdicts. \n3\n The appellant, however, urges that the Act discriminates against interstate commerce by exempting from its operation the privilege of sales by manufacturers paying tax on their capital employed in manufacture in Virginia. It is said that if its bakery were situate in Virginia the appellant would have the benefit of this exemption and, since it is not, the marketing of appellant's goods shipped into the State is the target of a hostile discrimination. But the argument overlooks the fact that peddlers resident in Virginia who buy their goods within the State, or buy or procure them \n\n[313 \nU.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n from extrastate cources, are alike subject to the Act. The contention that the Act discriminates against interstate commerce by virtue of the exemption in question is negatived by our decisions. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n 2. \nExamination of the Tax Code of Virginia discloses that the Act in question is but one portion of a comprehensive scheme of taxation. Manufacturers who sell their own products pay a tax on capital, which the State deems sufficient to cover all their activities, including the vending of the goods. \n5\n Wholesale merchants who have a fixed place of business pay a license tax measured by a percentage of all their purchases; and if they are also licensed by the town or city in which they have their place of business or, in lieu thereof, are taxed by such town or city on the capital employed in the business, they may sell and deliver at the same time and place anywhere in the State without payment of any additional license tax. \n6\n Every distributing house, whether operated by a manufacturer or wholesaler for distributing goods amongst the owner's retail stores must be licensed and pay the same tax as if it were a wholesaler. \n7\n Retail merchants8 and peddlers at retail9 must be licensed and pay license taxes,-the former a percentage of the value of his purchases and the latter a fixed annual fee. Those who have no fixed place of business, who peddle their wares only to licensed dealers or retailers at the places of business of the latter, fall into none of the described classes. As the court below points out, were it not for \n\n[313 \nU.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n s 192b, such peddlers would be the only vendors in Virginia to escape some form of taxation.\n Peddlers at wholesale are not entitled to be licensed and taxed on the same basis as other vendors, as respects either form or amount. As we have repeatedly held, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a state from classifying businesses for taxation or impose any iron rule of equality. \n10\n Some occupations may be taxed though others are not. Some may be taxed at one rate, others at a different rate. Classification is not discrimination. It is enough that those in the same class are treated with equality. That is true here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts of Virginia, 1932, p. 376, 1938, p. 440; Va.

HELVERING(1941)\nNo. 408\nArgued: April 1, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Rollin Browne, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The ultimate question here involved is whether two testamentary trusts of which petitioner is trustee were in 1931 'carrying on ... business' within the meaning of section 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(a)(1).\n Pursuant to the will of Angier B. Duke, two trusts, consisting of stocks and bonds worth approximately $7,600,000, were established in 1923 for the benefit of Duke's two minor sons. Petitioner, as trustee, was charged with the duty of applying a sufficient amount of the income of each trust to the support and education of the beneficiary; \n\n[313 \nU.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n the surplus income was to be accumulated until the beneficiary's majority; and at that time all accumulated income was to be paid to the beneficiary, while the principal was to be continued in trust for the benefit of the son and his descendants. By 1931, the principal and accumulated income of the two trusts aggregated about $10,000,000. In that year the Surrogate Court of New York County allowed trustees' commissions of about $77,000, ordering that payment be made out of principal. In reporting trust income for 1931, the trustee did not claim any deduction for these commissions. Later, in proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals, the deduction was claimed but denied. The ground of denial was that during the taxable year the trusts had not been 'carrying on any trade or business', the carrying on of such an activity being a condition precedent to the allowance of the claimed deduction under the controlling Revenue Act. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n Differing interpretations as to the meaning and scope of 'carrying on any trade or business' prompted us to grant certiorari in this case, \n312 \nU.S. 672\n, 61 S.Ct. 619, 85 L.Ed. --, i the case of Pyne v. United States, Ct.Cl., 35 F.Supp. 81, and in the case of Higgins v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 795; Id., \n312 \nU.S. 212\n, 61 S.Ct. 475, 85 L. Ed. --.\n In the Higgins case, decided on February 3, we affirmed the judgment of the same Circuit Court of Appeals that rendered the decision below. Higgins, an individual taxpayer whose activities did not vary materially from the activi- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n ties of the taxpaying trusts in the case at bar,3 was denied the deduction which petitioner here seeks. And sections 161, 162 of the Revenue Act of 1928 provide: 'The taxes imposed by this title (chapter) upon individuals shall apply to the income of estates or of any kind of property held in trust. ... The net income of the estate or trust shall be computed in the same manner and on the same basis as in the case of an individual .... ' Since the trust is subject to the same rules as the individual, and since the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals in the Higgins case and in the case at bar are substantially the same,4 the Higgins case is controlling here, unless, as petitioner contends, dis- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n tinguishable by reason of administrative practice in relation to trusts.\n But we regard the Higgins decision as controlling despite petitioner's insistance that administrative practice has long permitted deduction of trustees' commissions. In view of the express Congressional command that the same method and basis of computation must be applied to trust income as to individual income, it is doubtful whether any administrative practice, no matter how clear or long existing, would warrant our applying one concept of carrying on business in the case of an individual and another concept in the case of a trust. This is particularly true here, where the statutory interpretation petitioner urges has never received support in any regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury. \n5\n And not only is the result reached by the court below consistent with our decision in Higgins v. Commissioner, but, as we said in the Higgins case (\n312 \nU.S. 218\n, 61 S.Ct. 478, 85 L.Ed. --), the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals 'is adequately supported by this record, and rests upon a conception of carrying on business similar to that expressed by this Court for an antecedent section.' \n6\n The judgment below is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act 1928,  23(a), 161, 162, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(a) (1), 161, 162. Cf. George Vanderbilt Trust v. Com'r, 36 B.T.A. 967. Though petitioner urges that the Commissioner, because of concessions made before the Board of Tax Appeals, should be barred from asserting that the trusts were not carrying on business, the judgment of the Board rested on its finding that the trusts were not so engaged, and the issue is properly before us. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 457. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Board found in this case that the trustee's activities were limited to reviewing the stocks and bonds in trust several times a year; selling securities and reinvesting the proceeds in other stocks and bonds; collecting interest and dividends on security; keeping account books for the trusts and rendering statements to the interested parties; preparing and filing income tax returns; and distributing income to the beneficiaries. Summarizing, the Board of Tax Appeals said, 'The above facts demonstrate conclusively to us that this is a case of passive investment and not of carrying on a business, for not only is the trustee limited in its investments, but it is cautioned in effect to be a safe investor rather than a participant in trade or business, and, plainly carrying out the testator's injunctions, it conducts no business, because it has, as above seen, no expenses of conducting business other than the collection of coupons and mailing bonds, amounting to a few dollars, and an even more negligible amount for transfer stamps or notary fees. ... Extensive authority need not be compiled to demonstrate that a mere passive investor, collecting interest and clipping coupons, and making a very few reinvestments, is not engaged in trade or business.' (39 B.T.A. 29, 35.) \n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is clear that the Board was justified in reaching the conclusion that the instant trusts were not 'business trusts' but existed merely to hold and conserve property and distribute the income received.

(For brevity's sake the parties will be referred to as Chase, Indianapolis Gas, Citizens Gas, and the City, respectively.) The power of the District Court to entertain this litigation was sustained by the Circuit \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit under the provision of the Judicial Code conferring upon the district courts jurisdiction 'Of all suits of a civil nature ... where the matter in controversy exceeds ... $3,000, and ... is between citizens of different States ....' 36 Stat. 1091, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1). The correctness of this jurisdictional ruling must be determined before the merits of Chase's claims can be considered. The specific question is this: Does an alignment of the parties in relation to their real interests in the 'matter in controversy' satisfy the settled requirements of diversity jurisdiction?\n As is true of many problems in the law, the answer is to be found not in legal learning but in the realities of the record. Though variously expressed in the decisions, the governing principles are clear. To sustain diversity jurisdiction there must exist an 'actual', Helm v. Zarecor, \n222 \nU.S. 32, 36\n, 32 S.Ct. 10, 11, 'substantial', Niles-Bement- Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders' Union, \n254 \nU.S. 77, 81\n, 41 S.Ct. 39, 41, controversy between citizens of different states, all of whom on one side of the controversy are citizens of different states from all parties on the other side. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267. Diversity jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon the federal courts by the parties' own determination of who are plaintiffs and who defendants. It is our duty, as it is that of the lower federal courts, to 'look beyond the pleadings, and arrange the parties according to their sides in the dispute'. Dawson v. Columbia Ave. Sav. Fund, Safe Deposit, Title & Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178, 180\n, 25 S.Ct. 420, 421. Litigation is the pursuit of practical ends, not a game of chess. Whether the necessary 'collision of interest', Dawson v. Columbia Ave. Sav. Fund, Safe Deposit, Title & Trust Co., supra, 197 U.S. at page 181, 25 S.Ct. at page 421, exists, is therefore not to be determined by mechanical rules. It must be ascertained from the 'principal purpose of the suit', East Tennessee, etc., Railroad Co. v. Grayson, \n119 \nU.S. 240, 244\n, 7 S.Ct. 190, 192, and the 'primary and controlling matter in dispute', Merchants' Cotton-Press & Storage Co. v. Insurance Co., \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n \n151 \nU.S. 368, 385\n, 14 S.Ct. 367, 373. These familiar doctrines governing the alignment of parties for purposes of determining diversity of citizenship have consistently guided the lower federal courts 1 and this Court. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n And so we turn to the actualities of this litigation.\n Chase is the trustee under a mortgage deed to secure a bond issue executed by Indianapolis Gas in 1902. In 1906 Citizens Gas was formed to compete with Indianapolis Gas in the distribution of light, heat, and power to the people of Indianapolis. Its franchise provided that after the expiration of twenty-five years and the performance of certain specified conditions, the company should be would up and its property conveyed to the City subject to the company's 'outstanding legal obligations'. The competition between the two gas companies continued until 1913, when Indianapolis Gas leased all of its gas plant property to Citizens Gas for a term of ninety-nine years. Citizens Gas agreed to pay as rental (a) the interest on the lessor's outstanding bonded indebtedness, and (b) annual sums equal to a six per cent return on Indianapolis Gas's common stock. For twenty-two years thereafter Citizens Gas operated the mortgaged property and paid the interest on the bonds. In 1935, pursuant to its franchise, Citizens Gas conveyed its entire property, including that covered by its lease from Indianapolis Gas, to the City. But the City refused to regard itself bound by this lease. On March 2, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n 1936, the City and Indianapolis Gas agreed that, pending the settlement of the 'presently existing controversy' between them as to whether the lease was valid and binding upon the City, the latter would deposit in escrow sums equal to the interest and dividend payments falling due. The agreement expressly provided that it was made without prejudice to either party's 'position or rights'.\n Chase thereupon filed a bill of complaint in the District Court, naming as defendants Indianapolis Gas, Citizens Gas, and the City. It prayed that the lease from Indianapolis Gas to Citizens Gas be declared valid and binding upon the defendants, and as such be deemed part of the security for the performance of the mortgage obligations; that the City be ordered to perform all of the lessee's obligations in the lease and to pay directly to the plaintiff all of the interest payments as they shall become due; that judgment for overdue interest be entered against the defendants 'liable therefor'; and that the plaintiff be awarded costs and attorneys' fees. The City and Citizens Gas specifically denied that the lease was valid and binding upon them; they alleged, further, that the controversy existed solely between Indianapolis Gas and the City, 'citizens' of the same state. In its answer, Indianapolis Gas denied that it had 'ever contended or admitted that the said ninety-nine year lease was not and is not a valid and binding obligation' upon the defendants.\n Finding 'no collision between the interests of the plaintiff and the interests of the Indianapolis Gas Company', the District Court realigned the latter as a party plaintiff, and finding identity of citizenship between some of the plaintiffs and the remaining defendants, dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting, 7 Cir., 96 F.2d 363, and certiorari was denied, \n305 \nU.S. 600\n, 59 S.Ct. 77.\n On remand to the District Court Chase filed a supplemental bill alleging default as to interest payments falling \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n due and praying judgment against the defendants in the amount of the unpaid coupons. It alleged that 'neither The Indianapolis Gas Company nor Citizens Gas Company, nor both of them, have property sufficient to pay their interest in default on the Bonds, other than the property now in the possession and under the control of the City of Indianapolis'. This was admitted by Indianapolis Gas. The District Court held on the merits that the lease was not enforceable against either Citizens Gas or the City, that the former had no power under its franchise to bind the latter to the lease, and that by conveying the leased property to the City, Citizens Gas thereby discharged itself of its lessee obligations. Accordingly, the Court ordered that judgment be entered only against Indianapolis Gas for the amount of the unpaid interest.\n Asserting that the District Court erred in not holding the lease valid and enforceable against the defendants, both Chase and Indianapolis Gas appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained their position and again reversed, 7 Cir., 113 F.2d 217. The Court held, further, that Chase was entitled to a judgment for unpaid interest against the parties in the following order of liability: the City, Citizens Gas, and Indianapolis Gas. We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 636\n, 61 S.Ct. 74, because of the important jurisdictional issue involved in the litigation.\n The facts leave no room for doubt that on the merits only one question permeates this litigation: Is the lease whereby Indianapolis Gas in 1913 conveyed all its gas plant property to Citizens Gas valid and binding upon the City? This is the 'primary and controlling matter in dispute?. The rest is window-dressing designed to satisfy the requirements of diversity jurisdiction. Everything else in the case is incidental to this dominating controversy, with respect to which Indianapolis Gas and the City, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n 'citizens' of the same state, are on op1osite sides. \n3\n That the case presents 'only one fundamental issue' and that that is the obligation of the City under the lease, Chase admits and indeed insists upon in its brief on the merits. Chase and Indianapolis Gas have always been united on this issue: both have always contended for the validity of the lease and the City's obligation under it. The opinion of the District Court lays bare the heart of this controversy:\n'There can be no doubt that both plaintiff and the defendant, The Indianapolis Gas Company, have at all times asserted that the lease in question is valid and is binding upon the City, as Trustee. Neither is there any doubt as to their interest in sustaining the validity of such lease at the time of the institution of this action, prior hereto, and at all times subsequent thereto, and that many conferences have been held by and between them, through their attorneys, and many letters have passed between them relat- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 74]\n\u00a0\n ing to this subject.\n\n ... Later, when the parties (i.e., Indianapolis Gas and the City) were unable to adjust their differences and arrive at an agreement, it was decided by The Indianapolis Gas Company and the plaintiff that a suit should be instituted. The common stockholders of that company, of course, had a vital interest in the question of the validity of the lease because, if the lease is valid, they are assured of a six per cent return upon their stock for many years. If, however, a foreclosure suit should have been begun, or if the lease is invalid, no such return is assured. It was natural, therefore, that the Gas Company should take an active interest in the litigation and attempt to guide it along the course that would be most advantageous to it and to its stockholders.'\n Plainly, therefore, Chase and Indianapolis Gas, are, colloquially speaking, partners in litigation. The property covered by the lease is now in the City's possession; Chase is simply acting to protect the bondholders' security. As to Indianapolis Gas, if the lease is upheld, it will continue to receive a six per cent return on its capital, and the burden of paying the interest on its bonded indebtedness will be not upon it but upon the City. What Chase wants Indianapolis Gas wants and the City does not want. Yet the City and Indianapolis Gas were made to have a common interest against Chase when, as a matter of fact, the interests of the City and of Indianapolis Gas are opposed to one another. Therefore, if regard be had to the requirements of jurisdictional integrity, Indianapolis Gas and Chase are on the same side of the controversy not only for their own purposes but also for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. But such realignment places Indiana 'citizens' on both sides of the litigation and precludes assumption of jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship. We are thus compelled to the conclusion that the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 75]\n\u00a0\n District Court was without jurisdiction. \n4\n And, of course, this Court by its denial of certiorari when the case was here the first time could not confer the jurisdiction which Congress has denied. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 76]\n\u00a0\n This is not a sacrifice of justice to technicality. For the question here is not whether Chase and Indianapolis Gas may pursue what they conceive to be just claims against the City, but whether they may pursue them in the federal courts in Indiana rather than in its state courts. The fact that Chase prefers the adjudication of its claims by the federal court is certainly no reason why we should deny the plain facts of the controversy and yield to illusive artifices. Settled restrictions against bringing local disputes into the federal courts cannot thus be circumvented.\n These requirements, however technical seeming, must be viewed in the perspective of the constitutional limitations upon the judicial power of the federal courts,5 and of the Judiciary Acts in defining the authority of the federal courts when they sit, in effect, as state courts. See Madisonville Traction Company v. St. Bernard Mining Company, \n196 \nU.S. 239, 255\n, 25 S.Ct. 251, 257 and Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 \nU.S. 369\n, 377. The dominant note in the successive enactments of Congress relating to diversity jurisdiction is one of jealous restriction, of avoiding offense to state sensitiveness, and of relieving the federal courts of the overwhelming burden of 'business that intrinsically belongs to the state courts' in order to keep them free for their distinctive federal business. See Friendly, The Historic Basis of Diversity Jurisdiction, 41 Harv.L.Rev. 483, 510; Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, \n313 \nU.S. 100, 108\n, 109 S., 61 S.Ct. 868, 872; Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 270\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, 703. 'The policy of the statute (conferring diversity jurisdiction upon the district courts) calls for its strict construction. The power reserved to the states, under the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 77]\n\u00a0\n Constitution (Amendment 10), to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts, may be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the judiciary sections of the Constitution ( article 3). ... Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined.' Healy v. Ratta, supra, 292 U.S. at page 270, 54 S.Ct. at page 703. In defining the boundaries of diversity jurisdiction, this Court must be mindful of this guiding Congressional policy.

General Motors Acceptance Corp., \n298 \nU.S. 178\n, 56 S.Ct. 780.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON (dissenting).\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice REED and I are unable to concur in this disposition of these writs, in view of what we consider to be the controlling facts of this controversy.\n Chase is trustee under a mortgage executed in 1902 by Indianapolis Gas to secure a bond issue. The mortgage covered a public utility gas plant and distribution system, together with after-acquired property, including intangibles.\n In 1913 Indianapolis Gas turned the mortgaged utility system over to Citizens Gas, a competitor, under a lease for a term of ninety-nine years. Citizens Gas undertook among other things to pay the interest 'as the same shall from time to time fall due' on the bonds secured by the mortgage and also to pay certain sums, subject to some variation by reference to the price received for gas, to the stockholders of Indianapolis Gas. Citizens Gas unified \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 78]\n\u00a0\n this leased plant with its own, and in 1935 conveyed to the City the entire property in conformity to statute which it is contended obligates the City to assume the obligations of the lease. The City took possession of the property but refused to accept the obligations of the lease. The City and Indianapolis Gas then agreed that pending settlement of the controversy thus precipitated sums payable under the lease as interest should be deposited in escrow, instead of being paid to Chase. Accordingly there was default in the payment to the trustee of interest on the bonds.\n For jurisdictional purposes Indianapolis Gas, the mortgage debtor, and the City, whose possession of the property under the circumstances was alleged to result in an assumption of the debt, as well as Citizens Gas, the intermediate owner (who seems of no consequence to the issues under discussion), were all citizens of the State of Indiana, while Chase, the trustee, was a citizen of New York. Under these circumstances Chase began an action in the federal District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, joining Indianapolis Gas, Citizens Gas, and the City as defendants. It asked that the interest of Indianapolis Gas in the lease be adjudged a part of its security for the performance of the mortgage obligations; that the lease be declared valid and binding upon all the defendants; that the City be ordered to pay directly to the trustee all of the interest payments as they fell due; that judgment for overdue interest be entered against the defendants liable therefor, including Indianapolis Gas; and that plaintiff be awarded costs and attorneys' fees.\n This Court now destroys federal jurisdiction of the case by a transposition of parties, the radical nature of which appears most clearly from the judgments rendered below. It forces into the position of coplaintiff one party which the District Court adjudged entitled to recover over a million dollars and another which the District Court ad- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 79]\n\u00a0\n judged solely liable to pay that sum. This same adversity was found by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held the one entitled to receive and the other obligated to pay this sum with increase due to the lapse of time. It modified the judgment only by including two additional judgment debtors on whom it fixed primary and secondary liability, but continued the judgment against Indianapolis Gas with a tertiary liability for its satisfaction. The subtlety by which a judgment debtor is transfigured into a creditor for jurisdictional purposes deserves analysis, if for no other reason than because of its novelty.\n The Court cannot resort to a decision of the merits of the case over which it holds itself to be without jurisdiction in order to justify its characterization of some of the trustee's claims as 'window dressing' and 'artifice.' The measure of jurisdiction should be taken from the pleadings unless the claims are frivolous on their face. That is not the case here. In ultimate effect Chase alleged a cause of action and sought judgment against the City upon its personal undertaking to assume and pay the indebtedness upon the mortgage given by Indianapolis Gas to the plaintiff. It also alleged a cause of action and sought judgment against Indianapolis Gas for the amount of the coupon interest. Both demands were in excess of $ 3,000. If the plaintiff had asserted these demands in two separate actions, no one would doubt that both were within the jurisdiction of the District Court. In each there is an adequate diversity of citizenship and each involves the requisite jurisdictional amount and each is 'actual' and 'substantial' enough to support the jurisdiction, if this means anything more than that a demand exceeding $3,000 must be involved. A United States district court is not without jurisdiction to render a judgment exceeding $ 3,000 on confession if there is the requisite diversity of citizenship. In re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 90\n, at page 108, 28 S.Ct. 219, at page 223. The trustee's right to judgment against the mort- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 80]\n\u00a0\n gagor, even though uncontested, is a matter of substance, for the judgment is the important-indeed indispensable-means of pursuing the mortgaged property into the hands of the City in the event that it should turn out in the suit against the City that it had not become personally liable for any part of the mortgage debt.\n Jurisdiction of the federal courts is indeed a variable and illusory thing, if the jurisdiction which a District Court admittedly has of two separate causes of action is lost when they are united in one, agreeably to the federal rules of procedure, because the one defendant as a surety seeks to enforce its equitable right to be exonerated by the other who is alleged to be the principal debtor.\n The doctrine of realignment permits and requires a nominal defendant to be treated as a plaintiff for the purpose of defining the real controversy where no real cause of action is asserted against him by the plaintiff, but it does not admit of such treatment of a defendant against whom the plaintiff asserts a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the court. The plaintiff cannot rightly be deprived of the benefit of that jurisdiction, conferred upon him by laws enacted pursuant to the Constitution of the United States, because the court may think that such a cause of action is relatively less important than that asserted against another defendant or because one action 'dominates' the other or because one is more 'actual' or 'substantial' than the other. The statute itself sets up the criterion of substantiality by fixing the jurisdictional amount at $3,000. Moreover, in this case whether either of the rights asserted is more substantial than the other depends on the outcome of the litigation, which can hardly be used to determine jurisdiction which must exist at the beginning of the litigation.\n If we examine this controversy in detail it appears that the conflicts between the trustee and its mortgagor were \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 81]\n\u00a0\n not feigned or merely formal. While the mortgage and the debt, which created the opposition inherent in the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee or between debtor and creditor, were undenied, Chase was asking that its lien be judicially construed to cover not merely the physical property described therein but also the entire interest of Indianapolis Gas in the lease which required payments to stockholders over and above the interest payments for the bondholders. Furthermore, Chase asked the Court to set aside the escrow agreement by which Indianapolis and the City had assumed to exclude Chase from dominion over the escrow funds. Chase demanded that Indianapolis Gas be denied future control over such funds and that they be paid directly to itself. These were conflicts as to the extent of its interest in and control over any cause of action against the City. They existed between Chase and the defendant Indianapolis Gas and concerned them alone.\n There was also an issue as to the aggregate amount of the trustee's claim, which all defendants had a common interest in minimizing. The trustee claimed to be entitled to interest at 6% after default on coupons which bore a 5% interest rate, and it also claimed interest on overdue interest. This Court has held that where the only issue concerns the amount of the debt, as to which a mortgagor agrees with the plaintiff, but the issue is contested only by another mortgagor who has assumed the entire mortgage debt, the mortgage and the debt are the real subject matter of the controversy; that the decree when the amount is ascertained must run against all debtors; and that the uncontesting mortgagor is a necessary party on the side opposite the mortgagee. Ayres v. Wiswall, \n112 \nU.S. 187\n, 5 S.Ct. 90.\n There were other issues on which the defendants were in sharp conflict between themselves. Indianapolis Gas \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 82]\n\u00a0\n and Chase both served their respective interests by contending against the City that its acts had the legal effect of binding it to the terms of the lease. But their common attitude in relation to this issue sprang from different legal origins. The rights of Chase had their source and their measure in the mortgage. The mortgage might or might not, depending upon the outcome of the litigation, be construed to give Chase a right to enforce for its own benefit the lease terms as against the City. Indianapolis Gas, on the other hand, derived no rights against the City from that instrument and was not, like Chase, limited by it. Indianapolis Gas's rights had no other measure than that found in the terms of the lease itself.\n We would be diligent no less than the majority to prevent imposition on the jurisdiction of the federal courts by means of 'window dressing' or 'artifice.' We find in this case nothing that warrants either characterization, and we think that the precedents invoked to support today's action reveal the gap which divides the doctrine of realignment as heretofore applied by this Court from the application made of it today.\n The majority opinion leans heavily on Dawson v. Columbia Ave. Sav. Fund, Safe Deposit, Title & Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178\n, 25 S.Ct. 420, 421. Mr. Justice Holmes in that case said: '... it is obvious that the waterworks company is on the plaintiff's side, and was made a defendant solely for the purpose of reopening, in the United States court, a controversy which had been decided against it in the courts of the state.' And he said again: '... when the arrangement of the parties is merely a contrivance between friends for the purpose of founding a jurisdiction which otherwise would not exist, the device cannot be allowed to succeed.' And so say we, but there is not the slightest indication of this kind of connivance in the case before us.\n In Helm v. Zarecor, \n222 \nU.S. 32\n, 32 S.Ct. 10, this Court refused to align with the plaintiff a corporation although its board \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 83]\n\u00a0\n and officers were in entire agreement with the position of complainants on the merits of the case. Another of the cases invoked is Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders' Union, \n254 \nU.S. 77\n, 41 S.Ct. 39. Here a New Jersey corporation sought to break a strike by filing a bill in an Ohio District Court against labor unions, individual strikers, and an Ohio corporation, all citizens of Ohio. The New Jersey plaintiff owned a controlling interest in the Ohio defendant, the two had common officers and directors, and no relief whatever was asked against the Ohio company, which the bill alleged was being delayed in delivery of goods because of the strike. The Court refused to allow such an imposition on its jurisdiction. In Sutton v. English, \n246 \nU.S. 199\n, 38 S.Ct. 254, this Court held it to be error to align one of the defendants with the plaintiff for jurisdictional purposes where her interest was adverse to plaintiff on one out of four issues, although with plaintiff as to three of the four.\n We take the statement in the opinion of the Court that its basis is 'not in legal learning but in the realities of the record' to be another way of saying that it disagrees with the lower court's view of the facts rather than with its view of the law. Review of facts is not the conventional function of this Court, and resort to it at this stage of this litigation is somewhat less than fair to the courts below as well as to the litigants.\n Three years ago this Court refused to review the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that this controversy was within the federal jurisdiction. City of Indianapolis v. Chase National Bank, \n305 \nU.S. 600\n, 59 S.Ct. 77. Of course a denial of certiorari is not to be taken as a ruling on the merits of any question presented. However, where the case is again brought here after some years of litigation, jurisdiction ought not to be overturned on light or inconsequential grounds or on disagreements with the court below on matters of fact. To do so here is likely to result in further and, as we see it, needless delay in settling the status of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 63, 84]\n\u00a0\n an important utility and the obligations and rights of a populous municipality. We think it the duty of the Court to end this controversy by proceeding to judgment on the merits and that nothing in this record justifies ousting these parties from the federal courts. If, as the opinion intimates, the forefathers are thought to have been unwise in creating a federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship, we would think the remedy of those so minded would be found in Congressional withdrawal of such jurisdiction rather than in the confusing process of judicial constriction.\n We would follow the words of the jurisdictional statute when it is sought to restrict its application, quite as faithfully as when the effort is to enlarge it by recourse to doctrines which conflict with its words.

Chase of course did not bring this suit in order to obtain a declaration that, regardless of the validity of the lease, Indianapolis Gas is still ultimately responsible for the interest payments on its bonded indebtedness. That was not really in issue, and by its answer, Indianapolis Gas took it out of the case. The further argument is made that, by entering into the escrow agreement with the City, Indianapolis Gas has asserted a claim to the interest payments adverse to that of Chase and the bondholders. But the facts are against this contention. The agreement deals merely with the disposition of the interest falling due during the pendency of the litigation. Moreover, the lease between Indianapolis Gas and Citizens Gas contains no provisions requiring payment of the interest direct to Chase or the bondholders. Nor can diversity jurisdiction be rested upon so flimsy a basis as Chase's prayer for reimbursement of costs and attorneys' fess. The tail flies with the kite. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare Dawson v. Columbia Ave. Sav. Fund, Safe Deposit, Title & Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178\n, 25 S.Ct. 420, a suit by a Pennsylvania mortgagee of a Georgia waterworks company to restrain a Georgia city from building a new waterworks and to compel specific performance of the city's contract with the waterworks company. The latter was joined as a defendant, on the theory that it was a party to the contract sought to be enforced. The Court held that the bill should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction: '... the court will look beyond the pleadings, and arrange the parties according to their sides in the dispute. When that is done, it is obvious that the waterworks company is on the plaintiff's side.' 197 U.S. at page 180, 25 S.Ct. at page 421. Ayres v. Wiswall, \n112 \nU.S. 187\n, 5 S.Ct. 90, and Coney v. Winchell, \n116 \nU.S. 227\n, 6 S.Ct. 366, are not applicable here. They hold merely that in a foreclosure suit the mortgagee may join the mortgagor and his assignee as defendants; they did not involve any controversy between the mortgagor and the 'assignee' as to whether the assignment is binding upon the latter.\n Sutton v. English, \n246 \nU.S. 199\n, 38 S.Ct. 254, clearly holds that the parties must be aligned according to their 'attitude towards the actual and substantial controversy'. 246 U.S. at page 204, 38 S.Ct. at page 256. The plaintiffs, who included all of the heirs of Mary Jane except Cora, sought to establish their right to certain property claimed to have belonged to Mary Jane. The claimants could not recover unless they proved that a residuary bequest to Cora was invalid- and with respect to this issue, their position was completely adverse to Cora's. 'But, as already pointed out, even could complainants succeed in showing that Mary Jane Hubbard at the time of her death was entitled to the community property, her will giving all the residue of her property to Cora D. Spencer still stands in the way of their succeeding to it as heirs at law, and hence their prayer to have that will annulled with respect to the residuary clause is essential to their right to any relief in the suit.' 246 U.S. at page 207, 38 S.Ct. at page 257. If the plaintiffs prevailed on this issue of the validity of the residuary gift to Cora, their interests and hers would then be the same with respect to the remaining issues in the case. But the Court held that in relation to the 'actual and substantial controversy', Cora and the plaintiffs were on opposite sides, thereby sustaining diversity jurisdiction. In Sutton v. English, alignment of the parties with respect to their real interests sustained diversity; such alignment here precludes jurisdiction. That case and this are applications of the same principle. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Cf. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267; California v.

FEIRING(1941)\nNo. 863\nArgued: May 7, 1941Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paxton Blair, William C. Chanler, Sol Charles Levine, and Morris L. Heath, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Benjamin Siegel, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the obligation imposed upon sellers by a New York City sales tax (No. 20, published as No. 21, Local Laws of New York City, 1934, p. 143, as amended, No. 24, published as No. 25, Local Laws of New York City, 1934, p. 164), to pay a tax laid upon receipts from sales of personal property and collectible alternatively from the buyer or the seller is a 'tax' entitled to priority of payment in bankruptcy under  64 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  104.\n Petitioner, New York City, filed its claim against the estate of the bankrupt for taxes on sales of tangible property by the bankrupt during the five years following January 10, 1934. In the proceeding before the referee it appeared that the bankrupt had failed to collect most of the taxes from its buyers as required by the applicable law, and that the sole issue was with respect to the right of the City to priority of payment of the City's claim over those of general creditors. The District Court set aside the referee's order allowing the priority and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, In re National Stu ios, Inc., 118 F.2d 329, 330, holding that the sum claimed was not a tax, but that the 'bankrupt was liable to the city as a taxpayer who owes a tax or as a tax collector who owes as a debt the amount of taxes collected or to be collected'. We granted certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S.Ct. 843, 85 L.Ed. --, April 14, 1941, because of the suggested failure of the court below to follow our decision in New York City v. Goldstein, \n299 \nU.S. 522\n, 57 S.Ct. 321, reversing Matter of Lazaroff, 2 Cir., 84 F.2d 982, and of the asserted conflict in principle of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Barbee, Trustee v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 10 Cir., 103 F.2d 114. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended June 22, 1938, 52 Stat. 840, 874, 11 U.S.C.A.  104, awards priority of payment, in bankruptcy, to 'taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States or any State or any subdivision thereof ....' Whether the present obligation is a 'tax' entitled to priority within the meaning of the statute is a federal question. New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 \nU.S. 483, 491\n, 27 S.Ct. 137, 139; cf. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77; Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 555\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, 226; cf. United States v. Pelzer, \n312 \nU.S. 399\n, 61 S.Ct. 659, 85 L.Ed. --, decided March 3, 1941. Intended to be nationwide in its application, nothing in the language of  64 or its legislative history suggests that its incidence is to be controlled or varied by the particular characterization by local law of the state's demand. Hence we look to the terms and purposes of the Bankruptcy Act as establishing the criteria upon the basis of which the priority is to be allowed.\n As was pointed out in New Jersey v. Anderson, supra, \n203 \nU.S. 491\n, 27 S.Ct. 139, the priority commanded by  64 extends to those pecuniary burdens laid upon individuals or their property, regardless of their consent, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of government or of undertakings authorized by it. The particular demand for which the City now claims priority of payment as a tax is created and defined by state enactment. We turn to its provisions and to the decisions of the state courts in interpreting them, not to learn whether they have denominated the obligation a 'tax' but to ascertain whether its incidents are such as to constitute a tax within the meaning of  64. Cf. Morgan v. Commissioner, \n309 \nU.S. 78, 80\n, 81 S., 60 S.Ct. 424, 425, 426, and cases cited; United States v. Pelzer, supra; Ryerson v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 405\n, 61 S.Ct. 656, 85 L.Ed. --, decided March 3, 1941\n\n\n The present exaction is that which was considered, and its constitutionality sustained in McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876. The discussion of it there will be supplemented here only so far as is needful for the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n disposition of the issue now before us. It was enacted by the municipal assembly of New York City as an emergency revenue measure to defray the expense of unemployment relief, pursuant to authority conferred by the state legislature. Ch. 815, New York Laws 1933; Ch. 873, New York Laws 1934, Ex.Sess. Originally No. 24 published as No. 25, of New York Local Laws, 1934, p. 164, it has since been annually renewed with minor amendments not now material. Section 2 lays a tax upon receipts from retail sales in New York City of tangible personal property, and requires the seller, with exceptions not now material to charge the buyer with the amount of the tax, separately from the sales price and to collect the tax from him. Penalties are imposed by  15 for the seller's willful failure to comply with these requirements. Section 2 also commands that the tax 'shall be paid by the purchaser to the vendor, for and on account of the city of New York'. Section 5 requires the seller to file with the City Comptroller a 'return of his re eipts and of the taxes payable thereon' for prescribed periods. Section 6 requires the seller, at the time of filing a return to pay to the Comptroller the taxes upon all receipts required to be included in his return and also provides that 'all taxes for the period for which a return is required to be filed shall be due from the vendor and payable to the comptroller on the date limited for the filing of the return for such period, without regard to whether the return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the amount of receipts and the taxes due thereon'. But if the seller fails to collect the tax  2 also makes it the duty of the purchaser to file a return with the Comptroller and commands that 'such tax shall be payable by the purchaser directly to the Comptroller'.\n By  8 whenever either the seller or purchaser 'shall fail to collect and pay over any tax and\/or to pay any tax' imposed by the law, the City is authorized to bring an \n\n[313 \nU.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n action for its recovery or, as an alternative remedy, the Comptroller is authorized to issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of the county, commanding him to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the seller or the purchaser and apply the proceeds to the payment of the tax. In construing these provisions the New York Court of Appeals has held that while the Comptroller may proceed under  2 to collect the tax from the purchaser if he has not paid it to the seller, see Matter of Kesbec, Inc. v. McGoldrick, 278 N.Y. 293, 16 N.E.2d 288, the duty to pay the tax is also laid upon the seller whether he has in fact collected it and regardless of his ability to collect it from the buyer. Matter of Atlas Television Co., 273 N.Y. 51, 6 N.E.2d 94; Matter of Brown Printing Co., Inc., 285 N.Y. 47, 32 N.E.2d 787.\n The statute thus contains provisions which in its normal operation are calculated to enable the seller to shift the tax burden to the purchaser, see Matter of Kesbec, Inc. v. McGoldrick, supra, 278 N.Y. 297, 16 N.E.2d 288; Merchants Refrigeration Corp. v. Taylor, 275 N.Y. 113, 124, 9 N.E.2d 799; cf. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., supra, \n309 \nU.S. 43, 44\n, 60 S.Ct. 390, 391, 128 A.L.R. 876. But it is plain that both the vendor and the vendee are made liable for payment of the tax in invitum without regard to those provisions by which the seller may shift the incidence of the tax to the buyer and the tax may be summarily collected by distraint of the property of either the seller or the buyer. A pecuniary burden so laid upon the bankrupt seller for the support of government, and without his consent thus has all the characteristics of a tax entitled to priority of payment in bankruptcy within the meaning of  64 of the Bankruptcy Act. New Jersey v. Anderson, supra. Cf. United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 494\n, 50 S.Ct. 367, 368. It is not any the less a tax laid on the seller because the statute places a like burden in the alternative on the purchaser or because it affords to the seller facilities of which he did not avail himself to pass \n\n[313 \nU.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n the tax on to the buyer. While an action in debt may be resorted to for the recovery of a tax it is evident that in this case the bankrupt is liable to the state only because it owes a tax. Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492, 500\n, 46 S.Ct. 180, 181; Milwaukee County v. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 231.\n In New York City v. Goldstein, supra, we reversed per curiam, citing Matter of Atlas Television Co., supra, a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that a claim of the City for payment of tax by the seller was not entitled to priority under  64 of the Bankruptcy Act. The court below attributed our reversal to the circumstances that at that time, though not now,  64 allowed priority to debts entitled to priority under state law, and to the decision of the state court in the Atlas case, that upon a general assignment for the benefit of creditors made under state law a claim agains the seller for the sales tax was entitled to priority. But in placing this interpretation upon our decision in the Goldstein case the court below overlooked the fact that the Court of Appeals ruled in the Atlas case that an ordinary debt due the state is not entitled to priority by state law, and it sustained the priority in that case only on the ground that the demand was for a tax, the unqualified duty to pay which was placed by the statute on the seller. This interpretation of the state statute was reaffirmed by that court in the Matter of Brown Printing Co., Inc., supra. For reasons already given the duty imposed upon the seller by the taxing act thus construed is also a tax within the meaning of  64 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS thinks the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL MOLASSES CORP. v. NEW YORK TANK BARGE CORP.(1941)\nNo. 14\nArgued: October 16, 1941Decided: November 17, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. Catesby Jones and Leonard J. Matteson, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert S. Erskine, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding in admiralty originating in the District Court upon a petition by respondent as chartered owner of the tank barge 'T.N. No. 73', for limitation of liability for damage to petitioner's shipment of molasses resulting from the sinking of the barge in New York harbor.\n Petitioner, the sole claimant in the limitation proceeding, filed, in behalf of the insurer, its claim for loss of the molasses on the barge, which sank on Oct. 23, 1937, while taking on the shipment from the S.S. 'Althelsultan'. The barge sank in smooth water, without contact with any other vessel or external object to account for the sinking. By the contract of affreightment with petitioner's predecessor in interest, extended to cover the year 1937, respondent undertook to transport the molasses by barges in New York harbor from vessels or tidewater refineries to the shipper's customers and agreed that the barges are 'tight, staunch, strong and in every way fitted for the carriage of molasses within the limits above mentioned and (respondent) will maintain the barges in such condition during the life of this contract.' The contract also con- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n tained an undertaking on the part of the shipper of the molasses to effect insurance on cargoes for the account of respondent, the breach of which, it is contended, operated to relieve respondent from liability for any unseaworthiness of the barge.\n The 'T.N. No. 73' was a steel tank barge with four cargo tanks, two forward and two aft, separated by bulkheads, one extending fore and aft and the other athwartship. It had a rake fore and aft beginning 23 inches below the deck, affording space for fore and aft peak tanks. The customary method of stowing the barge was to pump the molasses into the forward tanks until the barge had a specified freeboard, then into the stern tanks until the stern had another specified freeboard, then back into the forward tanks until the barge was trimmed fore and aft.\n In the case of the present shipment the customary procedure was followed and the molasses was first pumped into the forward and then into the after tanks at a rate of from 3 to 3 1\/2 tons a minute. When the stern had approximately the desired freeboard the mate of the barge went forward to open the valves of the discharge pipes connecting with the forward tanks so as to fill them sufficiently to trim the barge fore and aft. On his way he stopped for a short time, the length of which was not precisely fixed, to carry on a conversation with some of the men on the vessel lying alongside. When he reached the valves for the forward tanks and before the valves for the after tanks had been closed, the barge sank by the stern. Only a small part of the molasses was saved and the value of that lost largely exceeded the value of the barge after salvage operations.\n Respondent attributed the sinking to overloading of the after tanks resulting from the mate's delay in shifting the flow of the molasses from the stern to the forward tanks. If, as alleged, over-filling of the stern tanks caused the loss without the privity or knowledge of respondent, it could \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n limit liability. R.S.  4283, 46 U.S.C.  183, 46 U.S.C.A.  183; La Bourgogne (Deslions v. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique), \n210 \nU.S. 95, 122\n, 28 S.Ct. 664, 673; The George W. Pratt, 2 Cir., 76 F.2d 902. But it was unnecessary to decide any question of limiting liability unless petitioner, the sole claimant, succeeded in establishing its claim.\n On the issues thus presented the District Court heard a great deal of testimony by witnesses who testified to all the circumstances attending the loading and sinking of the barge, and by experts as to its theoretical load capacity and the probable disposition of its load at the time the barge sank. There was also much evidence bearing on the seaworthiness of the vessel. This included the testimony of a representative of the cargo interests who had inspected the barge just before she began to receive the molasses and had found the tanks dry and clean, and who admitted he had found no evidence of leakage. There was also testimony by a diver who had examined the barge while she was on the bottom, and of others who had examined her condition after she had been raised and placed in dry dock.\n After a careful review of all the evidence the trial judge found that it was not sufficient to establish the fact that the sinking was caused by overloading the after tanks. He also found as a fact that upon all the evidence 'the cause of the accident has been left in doubt'. From all this he concluded that respondent was chargeable upon its warranty of seaworthiness by reason of the 'presumption' of unseaworthiness arising from the unexplained sinking of the barge which would deprive the owner of the right to limit liability. But as he thought the insurance clause in the contract of affreightment required petitioner to effect cargo insurance for account of respondent, which it had failed to do, he dismissed petitioner's claim. 1939 A.M.C. 673.\n The Court of Appeals affirmed, 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 248, 250, but for a different reason than that assigned by the trial judge for \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n his decision. It held that the burden was on petitioner to prove that respondent had furnished an unseaworthy barge. The court sustained the trial court's finding which it interpreted as meaning 'that the evidence as to whether or not the barge sank because of unseaworthiness, was so evenly matched that the judge could come to no conclusion upon the issue.' But it held that the \"presumption' of unseaworthiness', which would arise from the evidence of the sinking of the barge in smooth water without any other apparent or probable cause, did not survive the further proof which left in doubt the issue of the cause of the loss. The court accordingly held that petitioner had not sustained its burden. It thus became unnecessary to consider what burden would rest on the barge owner if he were seeking to limit liability on an admittedly valid claim. We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 643\n, 61 S.Ct. 394, to resolve an alleged conflict of the decision below with those of other circuit courts of appeals. Pacific Coast S.S. Co. v. Bancroft-Whitney Co., 9 Cir., 94 F. 180; The John Twohy, 3 Cir., 279 F. 343; Loveland Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 3 Cir., 33 F.2d 655; Gardner v. Dantzler Lumber & Export Co., 5 Cir., 98 F.2d 478; cf. The Edwin I. Morrison, \n153 \nU.S. 199\n, 14 S.Ct. 823, and because of the importance in the maritime law of the principle involved.\n With respect to the burden of proof, this case is to be distinguished from those in which the burden of proving seaworthiness rests upon the vessel when it is a common carrier or has assumed the obligation of a common carrier. The present contract of affreightment was for private carriage in New York harbor: The Fri, 2 Cir., 154 F. 333; The G. R. Crowe, 2 Cir., 294 F. 506; The Wildenfels, 2 Cir., 161 F. 864; The C. R. Sheffer, 2 Cir., 249 F. 600; The Lyra, 9 Cir., 255 F. 667; The Nordhvalen, D.C., 6 F.2d 883, and thus gave to respondent the status of a bailee for hire of the molasses. Southern Ry. v. Prescott, \n240 \nU.S. 632, 640\n, 36 S.Ct. 469, 472; Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg & M. Sand Co ., 4 Cir., 266 F. 283, 11 A.L.R. 686; Alpine \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 109]\n\u00a0\n Forwarding Co. v. Pennsylvania Railroad, 2 Cir., 60 F.2d 734; Gerhard & Hey, Inc. v. Cattaraugus T. Co., 241 N.Y. 413, 150 N.E. 500. Cf. The Nordhvalen, supra, 6 F.2d at page 887. Hence we are not concerned with the rule that one who has assumed the obligation of a common carrier can relieve himself of liability for failing to carry safely only by showing that the cause of loss was within one of the narrowly restricted exceptions which the law itself annexes to his undertaking, or for which it permits him to stipulate. The burden rests upon him to show that the loss was due to an excepted cause and that he has exercised due care to avoid it, not in consequence of his being an ordinary 'bailee' but because he is a special type of bailee who has assumed the obligation of an insurer. Schnell v. The Vallescura, \n293 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 55 S.Ct. 194, 196, and cases cited. See Coggs v. Bernard, 2 Ld.Raym. 909, 918.\n For this reason the shipowner, in order to bring himself within a permitted exception to the obligation to carry safely, whether imposed by statute or because he is a common carrier or because he has assumed it by contract, must show that the loss was due to an excepted cause and not to breach of his duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel. The Edwin I. Morrison, supra, 153 U.S. at page 211, 14 S.Ct. at page 826; The Majestic, \n166 \nU.S. 375\n, 17 S.Ct. 597; Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra; The Beeche Dene, 5 Cir., 55 F. 525. Cf. 39 Stat. 539, 49 U.S.C.  88, 49 U.S.C.A.  88; Uniform Bill of Lading Act,  12. See IX Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed.,  2508 and cases cited. And in that case, since the burden is on the shipowner, he does not sustain it, and the shipper must prevail if, upon the whole evidence, it remains doubtful whether the loss is within the exception. The Folmina (Jahn v. The Folmina ), \n212 \nU.S. 354, 363\n, 29 S.Ct. 363, 365, 15 Ann.Cas. 748; Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra, 293 U.S. at page 306, 307, 55 S.Ct. at page 197. A similar rule is applied under the Harter Act, 46 U.S.C.A.  190 et seq., which gives to the owner an excuse for unseaworthiness, if he has exercised due care to make his vessel seaworthy, for there the burden rests upon him to show that \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 110]\n\u00a0\n he has exercised such care. The Wildcroft (W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co. v. The Wildcroft), \n201 \nU.S. 378\n, 26 S.Ct. 467; The Southwark ( Martin v. The Southwark), \n191 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 24 S.Ct. 1, 4; May v. Hamburg, etc., Gesellschaft, \n290 \nU.S. 333, 346\n, 54 S.Ct. 162, 165.\n But as the court below held, the bailee of goods who has not assumed a common carrier's obligation is not an insurer. His undertaking is to exercise due care in the protection of the goods committed to his care and to perform the obligation of his contract including the warranty of seaworthiness when he is a shipowner. In such a case the burden of proving the breach of duty or obligation rests upon him who must assert it as the ground of the recovery which he seeks, Southern Ry. v. Prescott, supra; Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg & M. Sand Co., supra; The Transit, 3 Cir., 250 F. 71, 72, 75; The Nordhvalen, supra; Delaware Dredging Co. v. Graham, D.C., 43 F.2d 852, 854; Alpine Forwarding Co. v. Pennsylvania Railroad, supra, 60 F.2d at page 736; Gerhard & Hey, Inc. v. Cattaraugus T. Co., supra; Story on Bailments, 8th Ed.,  501, 504, 410, 410a; Wigmore, op. cit., supra,  2508 and cases cited, as it did upon petitioner here when it alleged the breach of warranty as the basis of its claim. Petitioner apparently does not challenge the distinction which for more than two centuries since Coggs v. Bernard, supra, has been taken between common carriers and those whom the law leaves free to regulate their mutual rights and obligations by private arrangements suited to the special circumstances of cases like the present. Nor do we see any adequate grounds for departing from it now or for drawing distinctions between a private bailment of merchandise on a barge in New York harbor and of goods stored in a private warehouse on the docks. Neither bailee is an insurer of delivery of the merchandise; both are free to stipulate for such insurance or for any lesser obligation, in which case the bailor cannot recover without proof of its breach.\n The burden of proof in a litigation, wherever the law has placed it, does not shift with the evidence, and in de- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 111]\n\u00a0\n termining whether petitioner has sustained the burden the question often is, as in this case, what inferences of fact he may summon to his aid. In answering it in this, as in others where breach of duty is the issue, the law takes into account the relative opportunity of the parties to know the fact in issue and to account for the loss which it is alleged is due to the breach. Since the bailee in general is in a better position than the bailor to know the cause of the loss and to show that it was one not involving the bailee's liability, the law lays on him the duty to come forward with the information available to him. The Northern Belle, 9 Wall. 526, 529; Gulf, C. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Ellis, 8 Cir., 54 F. 481, 483; Pacific Coast S.S. Co. v. Bancroft-Whitney Co., 9 Cir., 94 F. 180; The Nordhvalen, supra, 6 F.2d at page 886. If the bailee fails it leaves the trier of fact free to draw an inference unfavorable to him upon the bailor's establishing the unexplained failure to deliver the goods safely. Southern Ry. v. Prescott, supra; cf. The America, D.C., 174 F. 724.\n Whether we label this permissible inference with the equivocal term 'presumption' or consider merely that it is a rational inference from the facts proven, it does no more than require the bailee, if he would avoid the inference, to go forward with evidence sufficient to persuade that the non-existence of the fact, which would otherwise be inferred, is as probable as its existence. It does not cause the burden of proof to shift, and if the bailee does go forward with evidence enough to raise doubts as to the validity of the inference, which the trier of fact is unable to resolve, the bailor does not sustain the burden of persuasion which upon the whole evidence remains upon him, where it rested at the start. Southern Ry. v. Prescott, supra; Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg & M. Sand Co., supra; Tomkins C.S. Co. v. Bleakley T. Co., 3 Cir., 40 F.2d 249; Pickup v. Thames Insurance Co., 3 Q.B.D. 594. Cf. Del Vecchio v. Bowers, \n296 \nU.S. 280\n, 56 S.Ct. 190; Wigmore, op. cit., supra,  2485, 2490, 2491, and cases cited. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 112]\n\u00a0\n Proof of the breach of warranty of seaworthiness stands on no different footing. The trier of fact may in many situations infer the breach from the unexplained circumstance that the vessel, whether a common or private carrier, sank in smooth water. See The Edwin I. Morrison, supra; Work v. Leathers, \n97 \nU.S. 379\n, 380; The Harper No. 145, 2 Cir., 42 F.2d 161; The Jungshoved, 2 Cir., 290 F. 733; Barnewall v. Church, 1 Caines, N.Y., 217, 234, 2 Am.Dec. 180; Walsh v. Washington Marine Insurance Co., 32 N.Y. 427, 436; Zillah Transportation Co. v. AEtna Ins. Co., 175 Minn. 398, 221 N.W. 529; and cases cited below; Commercial Molasses Corp. v. New York Tank Barge Corp., 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 248, 251; Scrutton on Charter Parties and Bills of Lading, 14th Ed., 105. Whether in such circumstances the vessel has the status of a private bailee is of significance only in determining whose is the burden of persuasion. Wherever the burden rests, he who undertakes to carry it must do more than create a doubt which the trier of fact is unable to resolve. The Edwin I. Morrison, supra, 153 U.S. at page 212, 14 S.Ct. at page 828; The Folmina, supra, 212 U.S. at page 363, 29 S.Ct. at page 365, 15 Ann.Cas. 748; Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra. The English courts, after some obscurity of treatment, see Watson v. Clark, 1 Dow 336, have reached the same conclusion. Pickup v. Thames Insurance Co., 3 Q.B.D. 594; Ajum Goolam Hossen & Co. v. Union Marine Insurance Co., (1901) A.C. 362, 366; Lindsay v. Klein, (1911) A.C. 194, 203, 205; see Constantine S. S. Line v. Imperial Smelting Corp., (1941) 2 All.Eng. 165, 191, 192.\n Proof of the sinking of the barge aided petitioner, but did not relieve it from sustaining the burden of persuasion when all the evidence was in. This Court, in the case of private bailments, has given like effect to the rule that the unexplained failure of the bailee to return the bailed goods is prima facie evidence of his breach of duty, Southern Ry. v. Prescott, supra, 240 U.S. at page 640, 36 S.Ct. at page 472, and cases cited; see Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Thompson Mfg. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 416, 422\n, 46 S.Ct. 318, 319, and the lower federal courts have applied, correctly we \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 113]\n\u00a0\n think, the same rule with respect to proof of unseaworthiness by the shipper where the vessel has not assumed the obligation of a common carrier. Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg & M. Sand Co., supra, 266 F. at page 285, 11 A.L.R. 686; Robert A. Munroe Co. v. Chesapeake Lighterage Co., D.C., 283 F. 526; The Nordhvalen, supra; Tomkins C.S. Co. v. Bleakley T. Co., supra; Delaware Dredging Co. v. Graham, supra, 43 F.2d page 854. This is but a particular application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which similarly is an aid to the plaintiff in sustaining the burden of proving breach of the duty of due care but does not avoid the requirement that upon the whole case he must prove the breach by the preponderance of evidence. Sweeney v. Erving, \n228 \nU.S. 233\n, 33 S.Ct. 416, Ann. Cas.1914D, 905.\n The Edwin I. Morrison calls for no different result. There this Court reversed the findings of the lower court on the ground that the explanation offered for damage to the cargo by seawater taken in through a defective bilge pump hole, was only a conjecture supported by no direct testimony and was not sufficient to sustain the burden of the shipowner to prove that the vessel was seaworthy, saying (153 U.S. at page 212, 14 S.Ct. at page 828): 'If the determination of this question is left in doubt, that doubt must be resolved against' the shipowner. See The Dunbritton, 2 Cir., 73 F. 352, 358; The Alvena, D.C., 74 F. 252, 255. The court below had found that the bill of lading signed by the master-owner undertook to deliver the shipment in 'good order and condition', the 'dangers of the sea only excepted'. No exception was taken to this finding and in this Court the shipper's contention that such was the contract was not challenged by the owner. The opinion must be taken as proceeding, as in The Folmina and Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra, on the ground that the case was one in which the obligation assumed was that of a common carrier on whom the burden rests of proving that the cargo loss is not due to un- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 114]\n\u00a0\n seaworthiness. The expressions in the opinion, as to the burden of proof which the shipowner must carry in order to bring him within the exception of perils of the sea, have been cited, in the only instances when approved by this Court, as relating to the burden of proof on those who have assumed the obligations of common carriers. See The Majestic, supra, 166 U. S. at page 386, 17 S.Ct. at page 602; The Folmina, supra, 212 U.S. at page 363, 29 S.Ct. at page 365, 15 Ann.Cas. 748; Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra, 293 U.S. at page 305, 55 S.Ct. at page 196.\n Here petitioner relied on the inference to be drawn from the unexplained sinking of the barge to sustain its burden of proving unseaworthiness. But the evidence did not stop there. To rebut the inference, respondent came forward with evidence fully disclosing the circumstances attending the sinking. Inspection of the barge before the loading began and after she sank, and again after she was raised, failed to disclose any persuasive evidence of unseaworthiness. The method and circumstances of her loading at least tended to weaken the inference which might otherwise have been drawn that the sinking was due to unseaworthiness rather than fault in stowing the cargo. Upon an examination of all the evidence of which the sinking, without any proven specific cause, was a part, the two courts below have found that no inference as to the cause of sinking can be drawn. Petitioner has thus failed to sustain the burden resting on it.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n It has long been recognized that 'courts of admiralty are not governed by the strict rules of the common law, but act upon enlarged principles of equity.' O'Brien v. Miller, \n168 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 18 S.Ct. 140, 144. Where, as here, the result of a case in admiralty is made to turn upon the distinction between a common and private carrier, one may well ask whether more respect has been paid to technical niceties of the common law than befits the admiralty \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 115]\n\u00a0\n tradition. Cf. Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 105, 106, 107. I do not deny that in many situations the distinction may be important nor that legislatures and courts may be compelled from time to time to resurvey the changing line of separation. But here, I am convinced, the distinction is irrelevant to a just disposition of the case before us.\n In the opinion just announced, the burden of proving seaworthiness is tied up with a common carrier's obligations as an insurer. But in Schnell v. The Vallescura, \n293 \nU.S. 296\n, 55 S.Ct. 194, although the defendant was a common carrier on whom it was held such a burden lies, no suggestion that the Court rested its result upon the peculiar obligation of the defendant as an insurer can be found in the opinion. And so far as appears from the briefs and arguments of counsel as well as the majority opinion here, it would seem that this Court has never before given the insurer's liability of common carriers as the reason for the heavy burden of proof they bear in admiralty cases of this type. On the contrary, the basis usually given for the rule is the one explicitly stated in Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra, 293 U.S. at page 304, 55 S.Ct. at page 196:\n'The reason for the rule is apparent. He is a bailee intrusted with the shipper's goods, with respect to the care and safe delivery of which the law imposes upon him an extraordinary duty. Discharge of the duty is peculiarly within his control. All the facts and circumstances upon which he may rely to relieve him of that duty are peculiarly within his knowledge and usually unknown to the shipper. In consequence, the law casts upon him the burden of the loss which he cannot explain or, explaining, bring within the exceptional case in which he is relieved from liability.'\n\n It is difficult to see any persuasive reason for concluding that the rule as thus explained is any less appropriately applied to private carriers than to common \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 116]\n\u00a0\n carriers. In both cases the shipper normally has no representative on board the ship, the master and crew being employees of the carrier, with the result that the difficulties encountered by the shipper in seeking to find out how the loss occurred are equally great. See Carver, Carriage of Goods by Sea, 8th Ed., 9.\n I have found no language in the opinions of this Court in cases holding the burden of proof of seaworthiness rests on a common carrier that even suggests, not to say compels, the inference that a different result would have been reached if the carrier had been a private one. Hence, if the question of this case were one of original impression, I should see no obstacle to a holding that would give to the shipper here, who clearly had no easier access to evidence than did the shipper in the Vallescura case, the benefits of a similar allocation of the burden of proof.\n But the question is not one of original impression. In The Edwin I. Morrison, \n153 \nU.S. 199\n, 14 S.Ct. 823, 825, this Court held that the burden was on a private carrier to prove seaworthiness in a controversy distinguishable in no significant respect from that now before us. The opinion of the Court here has suggested that the finding by the Circuit Court in the Morrison case that the bill of lading stated that the carrier would deliver the shipment 'in good order and condition' amounted to a finding that the carrier had by contract assumed additional obligations, i.e., those of a common carrier. Hence, the Court sees in that decision nothing more that the reiteration of the proposition that a common carrier has the burden of proving seaworthiness and finds in it no indication of what the burden of a private carrier should be.\n It may seriously be questioned whether the finding that the bill of lading contained the casual phrase just quoted can properly be interpreted as a finding of a contract to assume the peculiar liabilities (whatever they may have \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 117]\n\u00a0\n been) of a common carrier. But even on the assumption that the Court's interpretation of the finding is correct, its interpretation of the basis of decision in the Morrison case seems clearly erroneous. Nowhere in that opinion is there the smallest suggestion that the carrier was regarded as having bargained itself into a position of special liability. If the Court had believed a distinction must be made between private and common carriers, I should suppose it would have been explicit in stating that this carrier, although a private carrier, had assumed the obligations of a common carrier by contract. I think it inconceivable that it would have left a fact of such significance to be deduced from an inconspicuous phrase in the findings of the Circuit Court set out in a footnote to the 'Statement of the Case' seven pages before the opinion itself begins. The Edwin I. Morrison, supra, 153 U.S. at page 203, note 1, 14 S.Ct. at page 825.\n In The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 571, Mr. Justice Bradley stated: 'If ... with the new lights that have been thrown upon the whole subject of maritime law and admiralty jurisdiction, a more rational view of the question demands an adverse ruling in order to preserve harmony and logical consistency in the general system, the court might, perhaps, if no evil consequences of a glaring character were likely to ensue, feel constrained to adopt it. But if no such necessity exists, we ought not to permit any considerations of mere expediency or love of scientific completeness, to draw us into a substantial change of the received law.' In the 'received law' of this Court, at least since 1894, when the Morrison case was decided, no distinction has been drawn between private and common carriers with reference to the burden of proving seaworthiness. If such a distinction had existed, the 'new lights' shed by the awareness of ever increasing complexity in modern shipping, a complexity equally incomprehensible to the shipper whether he deals with a private or common carrier, could, perhaps not without propriety, have been taken by this Court as a reason for erasing it. But the contrary proce- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 104, 118]\n\u00a0\n dure, of establishing a distinction which neither was present in our received law nor is demanded 'to preserve harmony and logical consistency', seems wholly unjustifiable.\n Accordingly, it is my opinion that the judgment below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice BYRNES concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONSOLIDATED ROCK PRODUCTS CO. v.

The District Court confirmed the plan; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. In re Consolidated Rock Products Co., 9 Cir., 114 F.2d 102. We granted the petitions2 for certiorari because of the importance in the administration of the reorganization provisions of the Act of certain principles enunciated by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The stock of Union and Consumers is held by Consolidated. Union has outstanding in the hands of the public3 $1,877,000 of 6% bonds secured by an indenture on its property, with accrued and unpaid interest4 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n thereon of $403,555-a total mortgage indebtedness of $2,280,555. Consumers has outstanding in the hands of the public5 $1,137,000 of 6% bonds secured by an indenture on its property, with accrued and unpaid interest6 thereon of $221,715-a total mortgage indebtedness of $1,358,715. Consolidated has outstanding 285,947 shares of no par value preferred stock7 and 397,455 shares of no par common stock.\n The plan of reorganization calls for the formation of a new corporation to which will be transferred all of the assets of Consolidated, Union,8 and Consumers free of all claims. \n9\n The securities of the new corporation are to be distributed as follows:\n Union and Consumers bonds held by the public will be exchanged for income bonds10 and preferred stock11 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n of the new company. For 50 per cent of the principal amounts of their claims, those bondholders will receive income bonds secured by a mortgage on all of the property of the new company; for the balance they will receive an equal amount of par value preferred stock. Their claims to accrued interest are to be extinguished, no new securities being issued therefor. Thus Union bondholders for their claims of $2,280,555 will receive income bonds and preferred stock in the face amount of $1,877,000; Consumers bondholders for their claims of $1,358,715 will receive income bonds and preferred stock12 in the face amount of $1,137,000. Each share of new preferred stock will have a warrant for the purchase of two shares of new $2 par value common stock at prices ranging from $2 per share within six months of issuance, to $6 per share during the fifth year after issuance.\n Preferred stockholders of Consolidated will receive one share of new common stock ($2 par value) for each share of old preferred or an aggregate of 285,947 shares of new common.\n A warrant to purchase one share of new common for $1 within three months of issuance will be given to the common stockholders of Consolidated for each five shares of old common. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The new preferred stock, to be received by the old bondholders, will elect four out of nine directors of the new company; the new common stock will elect the re- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n mainder. \n14\n But on designated delinquencies in payment of interest on the new bonds, the old bondholders would be entitled to elect six of the nine directors.\n The bonds of Union and Consumers held by Consolidated,15 the stock of those companies held by Conslidated, and the intercompany claims ( discussed hereafter) will be cancelled.\n In 1929 when Conslidated acquired control of these various properties, they were appraised in excess of $16,000,000 and it was estimated that their annual net earnings would be $500,000. In 1931 they were appraised by officers at about $4,400,000, 'exclusive of going concern, good will and current assets.' The District Court did not find specific values for the separate properties of Consolidated, Union, or Consumers, or for the properties of the enterprise as a unit. The average of the valuations ( apparently based on physical factors) given by three witnesses16 at the hearing before the master were $2,202,733 for Union as against a mortgage indebtedness of $2,280,555; $1,151,033 for Consumers as against a mortgage indebtedness of $1,358,715. Relying on similar testimony, Consolidated argues that the value of its property, to be contributed to the new company, is over $1,359,000, or exclusive of an alleged good will of $500, 000, $859,784. These estimated values somewhat conflict with the conslidated balance sheet (as at June 30, 1938) which shows assets of $3, 723,738.15 and liabilities (exclusive of capital and surplus) of $4,253, 224.41. More important, the earnings record of the enterprise \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 518]\n\u00a0\n casts grave doubts on the soundness of the estimated values. No dividends were ever paid on Consolidated's common stock; and except for five quarterly dividends in 1929 and 1931, none on its preferred stock. For the eight and a half years from april 1, 1929, to September 30, 1937, Consolidated had a loss of about $1,200,000 before bond interest but after depreciation and depletion. And except for the year 1929, Consolidated had no net operating profit, after bond interest and amortization, depreciation and depletion, in any year down to September 30, 1937.17 Yet on this record the District Court found that the present fair value of all the assets of the several companies, exclusive of good will and going concern value, was in excess of the total bonded indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest. And it also found that such value, including good will and going concern value, was insufficient to pay the bonded indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest and the liquidation preferences and accrued dividends on Consolidated preferred stock. It further found that the present fair value of the assets admittedly subject to the trust indentures of Union and Consumers was insufficient to pay the face amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest of the respective bond issues. In spite of that finding, the District Court also found that 'it would be physically impossible to determine and segregate with any degree of accuracy or fairness properties which originally belonged to the companies separately'; that as a result of unified operation properties of every character 'have been commingled and are now in the main held by Consolidated without any way of ascertaining what part, if any thereof, belongs to each or any of the companies separately'; and that, as a consequence, an appraisal 'would \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n be of such an indefinite and unsatisfactory nature as to produce further confusion.'\n The unified operation which resulted in that commingling of assets was pursuant to an operating agreement which Consolidated caused its wholly owned subsidiaries18 to execute in 1929. Under that agreement the subsidiaries ceased all operating functions and the entire management, operation and financing of the business and properties of the subsidiaries were undertaken by Consolidated. The corporate existence of the subsidiaries, however, was maintained and certain separate accounts were kept. Under this agreement Consolidated undertook, inter alia, to pay the subsidiaries the amounts necessary for the interest and sinking fund provisions of the indentures and to credit their current accounts with items of depreciation, depletion, amortization and obsolescence. \n19\n Upon termination of the agreement the properties were to be returned and a final settlement of accounts made, Consolidated meanwhile to retain all net revenues after its obligations thereunder to the subsidiaries had been met. It was specifically provided that the agreement was made for the benefit of the parties, not 'for the benefit of any third person.' Consolidated's \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 520]\n\u00a0\n books as at June 30, 1938, showed a net indebtedness under that agreement to Union and Consumers of somewhat over $5,000,000. That claim was cancelled by the plan of reorganization, no securities being issued to the creditors of the subsidiaries therefor. The District Court made no findings as respects the amount or validity of that intercompany claim; it summarily disposed of it by concluding that any liability under the operating agreement was 'not made for the benefit of any third parties and the bondholders are included in that category.'\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that it was error to confirm this plan of reorganization.\n I. On this record no determination of the fairness of any plan of reorganization could be made. Absent the requisite valuation data, the court was in no position to exercise the 'informed, independent judgment' ( National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426, 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 678, 681, 682, 88 A.L.R. 1231) which appraisal of the fairness of a plan of reorganization entails. Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 1. And see First National Bank v. Flershem, \n290 \nU.S. 504, 525\n, 54 S.Ct. 298, 306, 90 A.L.R. 391. There are two aspects of that valuation problem.\n In the first place, there must be a determination of what assets are subject to the payment of the respective claims. This obvious requirement was not met. The status of the Union and Consumers bondholders emphasizes its necessity and importance. According to the District Court the mortgaged assets are insufficient to pay the mortgage debt. There is no finding, however, as to the extent of the deficiency or the amount of unmortgaged assets and their value. It is plain that the bondholders would have, as against Consolidated and its stockholders, prior recourse against any unmortgaged assets of Union and Consumers. The full and absolute priority rule of Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, 228 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 521]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 482, 33 S.Ct. 554, and Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, would preclude participation by the equity interests in any of those assets until the bondholders had been made whole. Here there are some unmortgaged assets, for there is a claim of Union and Consumers against Consolidated-a claim which according to the books of Consolidated is over $5,000,000 in amount. If that claim is valid,20 or even if it were allowed only to the extent of 25% of its face amount,21 then the entire assets of Consolidated would be drawn down into the estates of the subsidiaries. In that event Union and Consumers might or might not be solvent in the bankruptcy sense. But certainly it would render untenable the present contention of Consolidated and the preferred stockholders that they are contributing all of the assets of Consolidated to the new company in exchange for which they are entitled to new securities. On that theory of the case they would be making a contribution of only such assets of Consolidated, if any, as remained after any deficiency of the bondholders had been wholly satisfied.\n There are no barriers to a valuation and enforcement of that claim. If as Consolidated maintains the subsidiaries have no present claim against it,22 the claim \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 522]\n\u00a0\n can readily be discounted to present worth. It is provable by trustees of the subsidiaries, for the term 'creditors' under  77B, sub. b, includes 'holders of claims of whatever character against the debtor or its property, including claims under executory contracts, whether or not such claims would otherwise constitute provable claims under this Act (title).' 23 Consolidated makes some point of the difficulty and expense of determining the extent of its liability under the operating agreement and of the necessity to abide by the technical terms of that agreement24 in ascertaining that liability. But equity will not permit a holding company, which has dominated and controlled its subsidiaries, to escape or reduce its liability to those subsidiaries by reliance upon self-serving contracts which it has imposed on them. A holding company, as well as others in dominating or controlling positions (Pepper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295\n, 60 S.Ct. 238), has fiduciary duties to security holders of its system which will be strictly enforced. See Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., \n306 \nU.S. 307\n, 59 S.Ct. 543. In this connection Consolidated cannot defeat or postpone the accounting because of the clause in the operating agreement that it was not made for the benefit of any third person. The question here is not a technical one as to who may sue to enforce that liability. It is merely a question as to the amount by which Consolidated is indebted to the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 523]\n\u00a0\n subsidiaries and the proof and allowance of that claim. The subsidiaries need not be sent into state courts to have that liability determined. The bankruptcy court having exclusive jurisdiction over the holding company and the subsidiaries has plenary power to adjudicate all the issues pertaining to the claim. The intimations of Consolidated that there must be foreclosure proceedings and protracted litigation in state courts involve a misconception of the duties and powers of the bankruptcy court. The fact that Consolidated might have a strategic or nuisance value outside of  77B does not detract from or impair the power and duty of the bankruptcy court to require a full accounting as a condition precedent to approval of any plan of reorganization. The fact that the claim might be settled, with the approval of the Court after full disclosure and notice to interested parties, does not justify the concealed compromise effected here through the simple expedient of extinguishing the claim.\n So far as the ability of the bondholders of Union and Consumers to reach the assets of Consolidated on claims of the kind covered by the operation agreement is concerned, there is another and more direct route which reaches the same end. There has been a unified operation of those several properties by Consolidated pursuant to the operating agreement. That operation not only resulted in extensive commingling of assets. All management functions of the several companies were assumed by Consolidated. The subsidiaries abdicated. Consolidated operated them as mere departments of its own business. Not even the formalities of separate corporate organizations were observed, except in minor particulars such as the maintenance of certain separate accounts. In view of these facts, Consolidated is in no position to claim that its assets are insulated from such \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 524]\n\u00a0\n claims of creditors of the subsidiaries. To the contrary, it is well settled that where a holding company directly intervenes in the management of its subsidiaries so as to treat them as mere departments of its own enterprise, it is responsible for the obligations of those subsidiaries incurred or arising during its management. Davis v. Alexander, \n269 \nU.S. 114, 117\n, 46 S.Ct. 34, 35; Joseph R. Foard Co. v. State of Maryland, 4 Cir., 219 F. 827, 829; Stark Electric R. Co. v. McGinty Contracting Co., 6 Cir., 238 F. 657, 661-663; The Willem Van Driel, Sr., 4 Cir., 252 F. 35, 37-39; Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. W. R. Grace & Co., 4 Cir., 267 F. 676, 681; Costan v. Manila Electric Co., 2 Cir., 24 F.2d 383; Kingston Dry Dock Co. v. Lake Champlain Transp. Co., 2 Cir., 31 F.2d 265, 267; Dillard & Coffin Co. v. Richmond Cotton Oil Co., 140 Tenn. 290, 204 S. W. 758. We are not dealing here with a situation where other creditors of a parent company are competing with creditors of its subsidiaries. If meticulous regard to corporate forms, which Consolidated has long ignored, is now observed, the stockholders of Consolidated may be the direct beneficiaries. Equity will not countenance such a result. A holding company which assumes to treat the properties of its subsidiaries as its own cannot take the benefits of direct management without the burdens.\n We have already noted that no adequate finding was made as to the value of the assets of Consolidated. In view of what we have said, it is apparent that a determination of that value must be made so that criteria will be available to determine an appropriate allocation of new securities between bondholders and stockholders in case there is an equity remaining after the bondholders have been made whole.\n There is another reason why the failure to ascertain what assets are subject to the payment of the Union and Consumers bonds is fatal. There is a question raised as to the fairness of the plan as respects the bondholders \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 525]\n\u00a0\n inter sese. While the total mortgage debt of Consumers is less than that of Union, the net income of the new company, as we have seen,25 is to be divided into two equal parts, one to service the new securities issued to Consumers bondholders, the other to service those issued to Union bondholders. That allocation is attacked here by respondent as discriminatory against Union, on the ground that the assets of Union are much greater in volume and in value than those of Consumers. It does not appear from this record that Union and Consumers have individual earnings records. If they do not, some appropriate formula for at least an approximate ascertainment of their respective assets must be designed in spite of the difficulties occasioned by the commingling. Otherwise the issue of fairness of any plan of reorganization as between Union and Consumers bondholders cannot be intelligently resolved.\n In the second place, there is the question of the method of valuation. From this record it is apparent that little, if any, effort was made to value the whole enterprise by a capitalization of prospective earnings. The necessity for such an inquiry is emphasized by the poor earnings record of this enterprise in the past. Findings as to the earning capacity of an enterprise are essential to a determination of the feasibility as well as the fairness of a plan of reorganization. Whether or not the earnings may reasonably be expected to meet the interest and divident requirements of the new securities is a sine qua non to a determination of the integrity and practicability of the new capital structure. It is also essential for satisfaction of the absolute priority rule of Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra. Unless meticulous regard for earning capacity be had, indefensible \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 526]\n\u00a0\n participation of junior securities in plans of reorganization may result.\n As Mr. Justice Holmes said in Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 226\n, 28 S.Ct. 638, 639, 'the commercial value of property consists in the expectation of income from it.' And see Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S.Ct. 1122, 1124. Such criterion is the appropriate one here, since we are dealing with the issue of solvency arising in connection with reorganization plans involving productive properties. It is plain that valuations for other purposes are not relevant to or helpful in a determination of that issue, except as they may indirectly bear on earning capacity. Temmer v. Denver Tramway Co., 8 Cir., 18 F.2d 226, 229; New York Trust Co. v. Continental & Commercial Trust & Sav. Bank, 8 Cir., 26 F.2d 872, 874. The criterion of earning capacity is the essential one if the enterprise is to be freed from the heavy hand of past errors, miscalculations or disaster, and if the allocation of securities among the various claimants is to be fair and equitable. In re Wickwire Spencer Steel Co., D.C., 12 F.Supp. 528, 533; 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, pp. 870-881, 884-893. Since its application requires a prediction as to what will occur in the future, an estimate, as distinguished from mathematical certitude, is all that can be made. But that estimate must be based on an informed judgment which embraces all facts relevant to future earning capacity and hence to present worth, including, of course, the nature and condition of the properties, the past earnings record, and all circumstances which indicate whether or not that record is a reliable criterion of future performance. A sum of values based on physical factors and assigned to separate units of the property without regard to the earning capacity of the whole enterprise is plainly inadequate. See Finletter, The Law of Bankruptcy Reorganization, pp. 557 et seq. But hardly more than that was done here. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 527]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals correctly left the matter of a formal appraisal to the discretion of the District Court. The extent and method of inquiry necessary for a valuation based on earning capacity are necessarily dependent on the facts of each case.\n II. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the absolute priority rule of Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, supra, and Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, applied to reorganizations of solvent as well as insolvent companies. That is true. Whether a company is solvent or insolvent in either the equity or the bankruptcy sense, 'any arrangement of the parties by which the subordinate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights' of creditors 'comes within judicial denunciation'. Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville, New Albany & Chicago Ry. Co., \n174 \nU.S. 674, 684\n, 19 S.Ct. 827, 830. And we indicated in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, that the rule was not satisfied even though the 'relative priorities' of creditors and stockholders were maintained. ( 308 U.S. pages 119, 120, 60 S.Ct. page 9).\n The instant plan runs afoul of that principle. In the first place, no provision is made for the accrued interest on the bonds. This interest is entitled to the same priority as the principal. See American Iron & Steel Mfg. Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., \n233 \nU.S. 261, 266\n, 267 S., 34 S.Ct. 502, 504; Ticonic National Bank v. Sprague, \n303 \nU.S. 406\n, 58 S.Ct. 612. In the second place, and apart from the cancellation of interest, the plan does not satisfy the fixed principle of the Boyd case even on the assumption that the enterprise as a whole is solvent in the bankruptcy sense. The bondholders for the principal amount of their 6% bonds receive an equal face amount of new 5% income bonds and preferred stock, while the preferred stockholders receive new common stock. True, the relative priorities are maintained. But the bondholders have not been \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 528]\n\u00a0\n made whole. They have received an inferior grade of securities, inferior in the sense that the interest rate has been reduced, a contingent return has been substituted for a fixed one, the maturities have been in part extended and in part eliminated by the substitution of preferred stock, and their former strategic position has been weakened. Those lost rights are of value. Full compensatory provision must be made for the entire bundle of rights which the creditors surrender.\n The absolute priority rule does not mean that bondholders cannot be given inferior grades of securities, or even securities of the same grade as are received by junior interests. Requirements of feasibility26 of reorganization plans frequently necessitate it in the interests of simpler and more conservative capital structures. And standards of fairness permit it. This was recognized in Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., \n271 \nU.S. 445\n, 46 S.Ct. 549. This Court there said (271 U.S. page 455, 46 S.Ct. page 551) that though 'to the extent of their debts creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders against all the property' of the debtor company, 'it does not follow that in every reorganization the securities offered to general creditors must be superior in rank or grade to any which stockholders may obtain. It is not impossible to accord to the creditor his superior rights in other ways.' And the Court went on to say (271 U.S. page 456, 46 S.Ct. page 552), 'No offer is fair which does not recognize the prior rights of creditors ...; but circumstances may justify an offer of different amounts of the same grade of securities to both creditors and stockholders.' Thus it is plain that while creditors may be given inferior grades of securities, their 'superior rights' must be recognized. Clearly, those prior rights are not recognized, in cases where stockholders are participating in the plan, if creditors are \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 529]\n\u00a0\n given only a face amount of inferior securities equal to the face amount of their claims. They must receive, in addition, compensation for the senior rights which they are to surrender. If they receive less than that full compensatory treatment, some of their property rights will be appropriated for the benefit of stockholders without compensation. That is not permissible. The plan then comes within judicial denunciation because it does not recognize the creditors' 'equitable right to be preferred to stockholders against the full value of all property belonging to the debtor corporation'. Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, 271 U.S. page 454, 46 S.Ct. page 551\n\n\n Practical adjustments, rather than a rigid formula, are necessary. The method of effecting full compensation for senior claimants will vary from case to case. As indicated in the Boyd case, 228 U.S. at page 508, 33 S.Ct. at page 561, the creditors are entitled to have the full value of the property, whether 'present or prospective, for dividends or only for purposes of control', first appropriated to payment of their claims. But whether in case of a solvent company the creditors should be made whole for the change in or loss of their seniority by an increased participation in assets, in earnings or in control, or in any combination thereof, will be dependent on the facts and requirements of each case. \n27\n So long as the new securities offered are \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 530]\n\u00a0\n of a value equal to the creditors' claims, the appropriateness of the formula employed rests in the informed discretion of the court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, made certain statements which if taken literally do not comport with the requirements of the absolute priority rule. It apparently ruled that a class of claimants with a lien on specific properties must receive full compensation out of those properties, and that a plan of reorganization is per se unfair and inequitable if it substitutes for several old bond issues, separately secured, new securities constituting an interest in all of the properties. That does not follow from Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra. If the creditors are adequately compensated for the loss of their prior claims, it is not material out of what assets they are paid. So long as they receive full compensatory treatment and so long as each group shares in the securities of the whole enterprise on an equitable basis, the requirements of 'fair and equitable' are satisfied.\n Any other standard might well place insuperable obstacles in the way of feasible plans of reorganization. Certainly where unified operations of separate properties are deemed advisable and essential, as they were in this case, the elimination of divisional mortgages may be \n\n[312 \nU.S. 510, 531]\n\u00a0\n necessary as well as wise. Moreover, the substitution of a simple, conservative capital structure for a highly complicated one may be a primary requirement of any reorganization plan. There is no necessity to construct the new capital structure on the framework of the old.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The proceedings under  77B were instituted in 1935 by the filing of separate voluntary petitions by Consolidated, Union and Consumers. No trustees have been appointed, Consolidated remaining in possession. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The petition in No. 400 raises all of the questions discussed herein, while the petition in No. 444 raises only the question as to the authority of the reorganization court to approve a plan which substitutes one mortgage covering all of the property for so-called divisional mortgages on separate units of that property. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed memoranda urging that the petition in No. 444 be granted and that the petition in No. 400 be granted to the extent that it raised the same question as that presented by the petition in No. 444. \n311 \nU.S. 636\n, 61 S.Ct. 71, 85 L.Ed . --; \n311 \nU.S. 636\n, 61 S.Ct. 76, 85 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] $102,500 face amount of Union's bonds are held by Consolidated. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] As of April 1, 1937, the effective date of the plan.

The interest will be cumulative if not paid. The bonds, as well as the preferred stock, to be issued to Union and Consumers bondholders will be in separate series. The net income of the new company is to be divided into two equal parts: each part to be used to pay, with respect to bonds and preferred stock of each series, first, interest and sinking fund payments on the bonds; second, dividends and sinking fund payments on the preferred stock. Income remaining will be available for general corporate purposes. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] The new preferred stock will have a par value of $50 and will carry a dividend of 5 per cent. It will be noncumulative until the retirement of the bonds of the same series except to the extent that net income is available for dividends. Thereafter it will be cumulative. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] All of the new income bonds and preferred stock are to be issued to the public holders of Union and Consumers bonds. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] 79,491 shares of new common will be reserved for the exercise of warrants issued to old common stockholders; an additional 60,280 shares of new common, for the exercise of warrants attached to the new preferred. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] It is apparent that the majority of the new common will be held by the old preferred stockholders even if all warrants are exercised. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] See notes 3 and 5, supra. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Two officers and one ex-employee. These valuation figures included the properties of Reliance. See note 8, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The hearings on the plan were held before a master during November, 1937. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] This agreement covered the properties of Reliance as well as Union and Consumers. By a modification made in 1933 the agreement was to expire in February, 1938, Consolidated having an option to extend the agreement for another five years on specified notice. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] The agreement was modified in 1933 (by two officers acting for each of the four companies) whereby the depreciation to be credited to the subsidiaries should be credited only on termination of the agreement. At that time Consolidated was to have the right by paying a five per cent penalty, to pay twenty-five per cent of the amount of the depreciation credit in ten annual installments and the balance at the end of ten years from the date of termination. Some question has been raised as to the propriety of that modification, a question on which we express no opinion. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Consolidated seems to admit that that claim is valid, at least to the extent of net current liabilities aggregating more than $250,000 as of June 30, 1938. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] Respondent points out that even on the basis of a $3,300,000 valuation of the properties of Union and Consumers depreciation, depletion and absolescence charges would be approximately $1,250,000. \n[\nFootnote 22\n] Consolidated maintains that there is no present claim against it because no claim exists until termination of the operating to meet the interest and dividend requirements 1938, with an option in Consolidated to extend it for five years. But it does not assert, nor does the record show, that the option was exercised. But even if it had been, only the time when the amounts accrued were payable would be affected. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] For an equally broad definition of 'creditor' under Ch. X of the Chandler Act, 52 Stat. 840, see  106, subs. 1 and 4, 11 U.S.C.A.  506, subs. 1, 4. \n[\nFootnote 24\n] Thus Consolidated argues that under the operating agreement the machinery for an appraisal provided therein must be employed. Yet assuming arguendo that that is true, Consolidated which has been in possession and control throughout cannot rely on the failure to have an appraisal as a reason for blocking or delaying its duty to account. \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] Supra, note 10. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Sec. 77B, sub. f(1), 11 U.S.C.A.  207, sub. f(1). \n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] In view of the condition of the record relative to the value of the properties and the fact that the accrued interest is cancelled by the plan, it is not profitable to attempt a detailed discussion of the deficiencies in the alleged compensatory treatment of the bondholders. It should, however, be noted as respects the warrants issued to the old common stockholders that they admittedly have no equity in the enterprise. Accordingly, it should have been shown that there was a necessity of seeking new money from them and that the participation accorded them was not more than reasonably equivalent to their contribution. Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra; Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, 308 U.S. pages 121, 122, 60 S.Ct. page 10. In the latter case we warned against the dilution of creditors' rights by inadequate contributions by stockholders. Here that dilution takes a rather obvious form in view of the lower price at which the stockholders may exercise the warrants. Warrants exercised by them would dilute the value of common stock purchased by bondholders during the same period. Furthermore, on Consolidated's estimate of the equity in the enterprise, the values of the new common would have to increase many fold to reach a value which exceeds the warrant price by the amount of the accrued interest. \n\n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONTINENTAL OIL CO. v.

Continental's contention is that reinstatement was precluded because neither man remained an 'employee' within  2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(3). The decisive question, however, as we have ruled in the Phelps Dodge case, Phelps Dodge Corp. v. N.L.R.B., \n313 \nU.S. 177\n, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day, is whether reinstatement will 'effectuate the policies' of the Act. We therefore remand the case for an exercise by the Board of its judgment on that issue, in light of our opinion in the Phelps Dodge case. So ordered.\n Remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STONE reiterate the views expressed by them in the Phelps Dodge case.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY are of opinion that the Board's order should be affirmed for the reasons set forth by them in the Phelps Dodge case. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONWAY v. O'BRIEN(1941)\nNo. 344\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Paul E. Lesh, of Washington, D.C., and Herbert G. Barber, of Brattleboro, Vt., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edwin W. Lawrence, of Rutland, Vt., for respondent. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 492, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a citizen of New Hampshire, was injured when the respondent's car, in which she was a passenger, collided with another on a country road in Vermont. Diversity of citizenship gave jurisdiction to the District Court and petitioner recovered a verdict under the Vermont guest occupant law,1 which required her to prove gross negligence on the part of the respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, considering the evidence of gross negligence insufficient to go to the jury, reversed and dismissed the complaint. \n2\n We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 634\n, 61 S.Ct. 61, 85 L.Ed. --, to examine whether there had been sufficient compliance with Rule 50(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, to authorize dismissal of the complaint,3 but our view of the merits makes it unnecessary to discuss this question.\n The result is determined by a consideration of the facts in the light of the Vermont law. The accident occurred in broad daylight in the late morning of an August day. If the facts most favorable to the petitioner were accepted, the jury might have concluded properly that the defendant's car approached from the south a covered bridge on a little used country road at a speed of fifteen miles per hour. Respondent who was the driver and owner sat on the front seat with another. The petitioner and another lady occupied the rear seat. The bridge spanned Williams River which at that point \n\n[312 \nU.S. 492, 494]\n\u00a0\n ran eastwardly to join the Connecticut. As another car emerged from its southern end the collision happened.\n The road along which respondent was driving ran parallel with the southernly bank of the river for a short distance and then turned 'abruptly,' in a 'sharper curve than any on the road,' at a sixty degree angle down a nine per cent grade towards the bridge. Bushes and small trees cut off the view of a car 'coming out of the bridge' until the respondent's car was 'probably 30 feet' away.\n As respondent's light car came into this curve, he cut in to the left without slackening speed or blowing a horn and suddenly found himself face to face with a larger car coming out of the bridge on its right hand side of the road at two miles per hour. The collision knocked the heavier car backward several feet and through a guard rail on the west side of the bridge approach. The road approaching the bridge 'at this blind corner' was sandy, from fourteen to seventeen feet wide. Respondent testified he had known the spot 'all my life' and knew cars could pass only 'at a snail's pace.'\n The 'Law of the Road' in Vermont is to round curves 'as far to the right ... as reasonably practicable'4 and to 'signal with bell or horn' 'in going around a curve.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Under these circumstances we are of the opinion that the Vermont law requires the submission of the question of gross negligence to the jury. As a matter of law it seems quite plain that a jury might find a driver of a car familiar with the locality grossly negligent, when with three guests and without a signal he rounds a blind, sharp curve at fifteen miles per hour on the wrong side into a narrow bridge entrance. The accepted Ver- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 492, 495]\n\u00a0\n mont definition of gross negligence is found in Shaw v. Moore:6\n'Gross negligence is substantially and appreciably higher in magnitude and more culpable than ordinary negligence. Gross negligence is equivalent to the failure to exercise even a slight degree of care. It is materially more want of care than constitutes simple inadvertence. It is an act or omission respecting legal duty of an aggravated character as distinguished from a mere failure to exercise ordinary care. It is very great negligence, or the absence of slight diligence, or the want of even scant care. It amounts to indifference to present legal duty, and to utter forgetfulness of legal obligations so far as other persons may be affected. It is a heedless and palpable violation of legal duty respecting the rights of others. The element of culpability which characterizes all negligence is, in gross negligence, magnified to a high degree as compared with that present in ordinary negligence. Gross negligence is manifestly a smaller amount of watchfulness and circumspection than the circumstances require of a prudent man. But it falls short of being such reckless disregard of probable consequences as is equivalent to a willful and intentional wrong. Ordinary and gross negligence differ in degree of inattention, while both differ in kind from wilful and intentional conduct which is or ought to be known to have a tendency to injure.'\n\n This has been repeated many times in later cases. \n7\n The application creates the difficulties. The latest cases say 'each case must be judged according to its own facts.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 492, 496]\n\u00a0\n Admittedly there are instances among the Vermont cases which might be logically cited to support a refusal to submit this case. \n9\n About as many are upon the other side. \n10\n We think the District Court correctly appraised the law and facts.\n We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and affirm that of the District Court.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Vermont Public Laws (1933)  5113. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 611. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] As in Berry v.

NEW HAMPSHIRE(1941)\nNo. 502\nArgued: March 7, 1941Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 570]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hayden Covington and Joseph F. Rutherford, both of Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellants.\n Mr. Frank R. Kenison, of Conway, N.H., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants are five 'Jehovah's Witnesses' who, with sixty-three others of the same persuasion, were convicted in the municipal court of Manchester, New Hampshire, for violation of a state statute prohibiting a 'parade or \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 571]\n\u00a0\n procession' upon a public street without a special license.\n Upon appeal, there was a trial de novo of these appellants before a jury in the Superior Court, the other defendants having agreed to abide by the final decision in that proceeding. Appellants were found guilty and the judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. State v. Cox, 91 N.H. --, 16 A.2d 508.\n By motions and exceptions, appellants raised the questions that the statute was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it deprived appellants of their rights of freedom of worship, freedom of speech and press, and freedom of assembly, vested unreasonable and unlimited arbitrary and discriminatory powers in the licensing authority, and was vague and indefinite. These contentions were overruled and the case comes here on appeal.\n The statutory prohibition is as follows (New Hampshire, P.L., Chap. 145, Sec. 2): 'No theatrical or dramatic representation shall be performed or exhibited, and no parade or procession upon any public street or way, and no open-air public meeting upon any ground abutting thereon, shall be permitted, unless a special license therefor shall first be obtained from the selectmen of the town, or from a licensing committee for cities hereinafter provided for'.\n The provisions for licensing are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 572]\n\u00a0\n The facts, which are conceded by the appellants to be established by the evidence, are these: The sixty-eight defendants and twenty other persons met at a hall in the City of Manchester on the evening of Saturday, July 8, 1939, 'for the purpose of engaging in an information march'. The company was divided into four or five groups, each with about fifteen to twenty persons. Each group then proceeded to a different part of the business district of the city and there 'would line up in single-file formation and then proceed to march along the sidewalk, 'single-file', that is, following one another'. Each of the defendants carried a small staff with a sign reading 'Religion is a Snare and a Racket' and on the reverse 'Serve God and Christ the King'. Some of the marchers carried placards bearing the statement 'Fascism or Freedom. Hear Judge Rutherford and Face the Facts'. The marchers also handed out printed leaflets announcing a meeting to be held at a later time in the hall from which they had started, where a talk on government would be given to the public free of charge. Defendants did not apply for a permit and none was issued.\n There was a dispute in the evidence as to the distance \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 573]\n\u00a0\n between the marchers. Defendants said that they were from fifteen to twenty feet apart. The State insists that the evidence clearly showed that the 'marchers were as close together as it was possible for them to walk'. Appellants concede that this dispute is not material to the questions presented. The recital of facts which prefaced the opinion of the state court thus summarizes the effect of the march: 'Manchester had a population of over 75,000 in 1930, and there was testimony that on Saturday nights in an hour's time 26,000 persons passed one of the intersections where the defendants marched. The marchers interfered with the normal sidewalk travel, but no technical breach of the peace occurred. The march was a prearranged affair, and no permit for it was sought, although the defendants understood that under the statute one was required'.\n Appellants urge that each of the defendants was a minister ordained to preach the gospel in accordance with his belief and that the participation of these ministers in the march was for the purpose of disseminating information in the public interest and was one of their ways of worship.\n The sole charge against appellants was that they were 'taking part in a parade or procession' on public streets without a permit as the statute required. They were not prosecuted for distributing leaflets, or for conveying information by placards or otherwise, or for issuing invitations to a public meeting, or for holding a public meeting, or for maintaining or expressing religious beliefs. Their right to do any one of these things apart from engaging in a 'parade or procession' upon a public street is not here involved and the question of the validity of a statute addressed to any other sort of conduct than that complained of is not before us.\n There appears to be no ground for challenging the ruling of the state court that appellants were in fact \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 574]\n\u00a0\n engaged in a parade or procession upon the public streets. As the state court observed: 'It was a march in formation, and its advertising and informatory purpose did not make it otherwise. ... It is immaterial that its tactics were few and simple. It is enough that it proceeded in ordered and close file as a collective body of persons on the city streets'.\n Civil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the existence of an organized society maintaining public order without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses. The authority of a municipality to impose regulations in order to assure the safety and convenience of the people in the use of public highways has never been regarded as inconsistent with civil liberties but rather as one of the means of safeguarding the good order upon which they ultimately depend. The control of travel on the streets of cities is the most familiar illustration of this recognition of social need. Where a restriction of the use of highways in that relation is designed to promote the public convenience in the interest of all, it cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which in other circumstances would be entitled to protection. One would not be justified in ignoring the familiar red traffic light because he thought it his religious duty to disobey the municipal command or sought by that means to direct public attention to an announcement of his opinions. As regulation of the use of the streets for parades and processions is a traditional exercise of control by local government, the question in a particular case is whether that control is exerted so as not to deny or unwarrantedly abridge the right of assembly and the opportunities for the communication of thought and the discussion of public questions immemorially associated with resort to public places. Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 451\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 668; Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organiza- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 575]\n\u00a0\n tion, \n307 \nU.S. 496, 515\n, 516 S., 59 S.Ct. 954, 963, 964; Schneider v. State of New Jersey, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 160\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 306\n, 307 S., 60 S.Ct. 900, 904, 128 A.L.R. 1352\n\n\n In the instant case, we are aided by the opinion of the Supreme Court of the State which construed the statute and defined the limitations of the authority conferred for the granting of licenses for parades and processions. The court observed that if the clause of the Act requiring a license 'for all open-air public meetings upon land contiguous to a highway' was invalid, that invalidity did not nullify the Act in its application to the other situations described. Recognizing the importance of the civil liberties invoked by appellants, the court thought it significant that the statute prescribed 'no measures for controlling or suppressing the publication on the highways of facts and opinions, either by speech or by writing'; that communication 'by the distribution of literature or by the display of placards and signs' was in no respect regulated by the statute; that the regulation with respect to parades and processions was applicable only 'to organized formations of persons using the highways'; and that 'the defendants separately or collectively in groups not constituting a parade or procession', were 'under no contemplation of the act'. In this light, the court thought that interference with liberty of speech and writing seemed slight; that the distribution of pamphlets and folders by the groups 'traveling in unorganized fashion' would have had as large a circulation, and that 'signs carried by members of the groups not in marching formation would have been as conspicuous, as published by them while in parade or procession'.\n It was with this view of the limited objective of the statute that the state court considered and defined the duty of the licensing authority and the rights of the appellants to a license for their parade, with regard only to considerations of time, place and manner so as to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 576]\n\u00a0\n conserve the public convenience. The obvious advantage of requiring application for a permit was noted as giving the public authorities notice in advance so as to afford opportunity for proper policing. And the court further observed that, in fixing time and place, the license served 'to prevent confusion by overlapping parades or processions, to secure convenient use of the streets by other travelers, and to minimize the risk of disorder'. But the court held that the licensing board was not vested with arbitrary power or an unfettered discretion; that its discretion must be exercised with 'uniformity of method of treatment upon the facts of each application, free from improper or inappropriate considerations and from unfair discrimination'; that a 'systematic, consistent and just order of treatment, with reference to the convenience of public use of the highways, is the statutory mandate'. The defendants, said the court, 'had a right, under the act, to a license to march when, where and as they did, if after a required investigation it was found that the convenience of the public in the use of the streets would not thereby be unduly disturbed, upon such conditions or changes in time, place and manner as would avoid disturbance'.\n If a municipality has authority to control the use of its public streets for parades or processions, as it undoubtedly has, it cannot be denied authority to give consideration, without unfair discrimination, to time, place and manner in relation to the other proper uses of the streets. We find it impossible to say that the limited authority conferred by the licensing provisions of the statute in question as thus construed by the state court contravened any constitutional right.\n There remains the question of license fees which, as the court said, had a permissible range from $300 to a nominal amount. The court construed the Act as requiring 'a reasonable fixing of the amount of the fee'. 'The \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 577]\n\u00a0\n charge', said the court, 'for a circus parade or a celebration procession of length, each drawing crowds of observers, would take into account the greater public expense of policing the spectacle, compared with the slight expense of a less expansive and attractive parade or procession, to which the charge would be adjusted'. The fee was held to be 'not a revenue tax, but one to meet the expense incident to the administration of the act and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed'. There is nothing contrary to the Constitution in the charge of a fee limited to the purpose stated. The suggestion that a flat fee should have been charged fails to take account of the difficulty of framing a fair schedule to meet all circumstances, and we perceive no constitutional ground for denying to local governments that flexibility of adjustment of fees which in the light of varying conditions would tend to conserve rather than impair the liberty sought.\n There is no evidence that the statute has been administered otherwise than in the fair and non-discriminatory manner which the state court has construed it to require.\n The decisions upon which appellants rely are not applicable. In Lovell v. Griffin, supra, the ordinance prohibited the distribution of literature of any kind at any time, at any place, and in any manner without a permit from the city manager, thus striking at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship. In Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, supra (\n307 \nU.S. 496\n, 59 S.Ct. 964), the ordinance dealt with the exercise of the right of assembly for the purpose of communicating views; it did not make comfort or convenience in the use of streets the standard of official action but enabled the local official absolutely to refuse a permit on his mere opinion that such refusal would prevent 'riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage'. The ordi- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 569, 578]\n\u00a0\n nance thus created, as the record disclosed, an instrument of arbitrary suppression of opinions on public questions. The court said that 'uncontrolled official suppression of the privilege cannot be made a substitute for the duty to maintain order in connection with the exercise of the right'. In Schneider v. State, supra, 308 U.S., page 163, 60 S.Ct. page 151, the ordinance was directed at canvassing and banned unlicensed communication of any views, or the advocacy of any cause, from door to door, subject only to the power of a police officer to determine as a censor what literature might be distributed and who might distribute it. In Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, 310 U.S., page 305, 60 S. Ct. page 904, 128 A.L.R. 1352, the statute dealt with the solicitation of funds for religious causes and authorized an official to determine whether the cause was a religious one and to refuse a permit if he determined it was not, thus establishing a censorship of religion.\n Nor is any question of peaceful picketing here involved, as in Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, and Carlson v. People of California, \n310 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 746. The statute, as the state court said, is not aimed at any restraint of freedom of speech, and there is no basis for an assumption that it would be applied so as to prevent peaceful picketing as described in the cases cited.\n The argument as to freedom of worship is also beside the point. No interference with religious worship or the practice of religion in any proper sense is shown, but only the exercise of local control over the use of streets for parades and processions.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] New Hampshire, P.L., Chap. 145, Sections 3, 4 and 5 are as follows:\n'3.

Huxley, of Chicago, Ill., and Thomas J. Byrne, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action in equity brought by respondent for infringement, inter alia, upon claims 2, 3, and 11 of patent No. 1,736,544, granted November 19, 1929, on the application of H. E. Mead, filed August 24, 1927, for a cigar lighter. The District Court held these claims not infringed. 34 F.Supp. 146. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding them valid and infringed. 2 Cir., 117 F.2d 361. We granted the petition for certiorari, limited to the question whether claims 2, 3, and 11 of the Mead patent are valid, because of a conflict between the decision below and Automatic Devices Corp. v. Sinko Tool & Manufacturing Co., 112 F.2d 335, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n The claims in question1 are for improvements in light- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 86]\n\u00a0\n ers, commonly found in automobiles, for cigars, cigarettes and pipes. There were earlier lighters of the 'reel type'. The igniter unit was connected with a source of current by a cable which was wound on a spring drum so that the igniter unit and cable could be withdrawn from the socket and be used for lighting a cigar or cigarette. As the removable plug was returned to the socket the wires were reeled back into it. The circuit was closed either by manual operation of a button or by withdrawal of the igniter from its socket. In 1921 the Morris patent (No. 1,376,154) was issued for a so-called 'wireless' or 'cordless' lighter. This lighter eliminated the cables and the mechanism for winding and unwinding them, it provided for heating the igniter unit without removing it from its socket, and it eliminated all electrical and mechanical connection of the igniter unit with the socket once it was removed therefrom for use. Several types of the 'wireless' or 'cordless' lighter appeared. \n2\n Morris represented a type in which the circuit was open when the plug rested \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 87]\n\u00a0\n in the socket and closed when the plug was pushed farther into the socket against the resistance of a spring. In Zecchini (No. 1,437,701) the operator pressed and held down a push-button to close the circuit. In Metzger (No. 1,622,334) the operator closed the circuit by depressing and rotating the plug. In each the operator was obliged to hold the plug, or the circuit-closing part, in place until the heating coil became hot enough for use. After he concluded that it had become hot enough (by observation or guess work) he removed the plug, using it like a match or hot coal, and then replaced it in the socket. Thus these lighters were said to require rather continual attention on the part of the person using them, so that there would be no over-heating or burning out of the heating coil.\n This inconvenience and hazard were eliminated, according to respondent,3 by the automatic feature of the Mead patent. Mead added to the so-called 'wireless' or 'cordless' lighter a thermostatic control responsive to the temperature of the heating coil. In operation it automatically returned the plug to its 'off' position after the heating coil had reached the proper temperature. To operate Mead's device the knob on the igniter plug was turned to a point where an electrical connection was established from the battery through the heating coil. There the plug remained temporarily latched. When the heating coil was sufficiently hot for use, the bimetallic elements in the thermostat responsive to the temperature condition of the heating coil caused the igniter plug to be released and to be moved by operation of a spring to open-circuit position. The plug might then be manually removed for use in the manner of a match, torch, or ember. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 88]\n\u00a0\n When replaced in the socket after use, it was held in open-circuit position until next needed.\n Petitioner makes several objections to the validity of the claims- that they do not comply with the standards for full, clear and concise description prescribed by 35 U.S.C.  33, 35 U.S.C.A.  33, R.S.  4888; that they are indefinite and broader than any disclosed invention; and that they are for a device so imperfect and unsuccessful that a construction of the claims broad enough to include it is not permissible. See Deering v. Winona Harvester Works, \n155 \nU.S. 286, 295\n, 15 S.Ct. 118, 121. We do not, however, stop to consider these objections. For it is our opinion that the Mead device was not the result of invention but a 'mere exercise of the skill of the calling', an advance 'plainly indicated by the prior art'. Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc., v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 477, 486\n, 55 S.Ct. 455, 458.\n Thermostatic controls of a heating unit, operating to cut off an electric current energizing the unit when its temperature had reached the desired point, were well known to the art when Mead made his device. They had been employed in a wide variety of electrical designs since Hammarstrom in 1893 (No. 493,380) showed a bimetallic thermostat to break a circuit when it got overcharged. A few examples will suffice. Harley in 1907 (No. 852,326) included such a thermostat in an electric heater for vulcanizing, so as to limit automatically the temperature attainable. Andrews in 1912 (No. 1,025,852) showed a bimetallic thermostat in an electrical flat iron designed to open the circuit at a predetermined temperature. In 1919 Newsom (No. 1,318,168) showed an electric coffee cooker in which a thermostat, actuated by the temperature within the receptacle, operated to open and close the circuit intermittently. Stahl in 1921 (No. 1,372,207) showed an electric switch automatically released by operation of a thermostat. Hurxthal in 1925 (No. 1,540,628) showed an electric bread toaster with a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 89]\n\u00a0\n thermostat for stopping the toasting when the bread reached a given degree of temperature. Copeland (No. 1,844,206), filed April 18, 1927, before Mead, showed an electric lighter for cigars and cigarettes with thermostatic control. It differed from Mead in several respects. Thus in Copeland's device a cigar was inserted in a tube at the end of which was a heating coil. By pressing the cigar against the heating coil (or in another form, by pressing a push-button) a spring was overset and the circuit closed. When the desired temperature of the heating unit was reached, a thermostatic bar pushed back the spring and opened the circuit. Thus in the Copeland device the cigar (or the push-button) was the 'means for moving' the 'heating member' of the Mead claims so as to establish the energizing electric heating circuit. The advance of Mead over Copeland was the use of the removable plug bearing the heating unit, as in Morris, to establish the automatically controlled circuit of Copeland.\n And so the question is whether it was invention for one skilled in the art and familiar with Morris and Copeland, and with the extensive use of the automatic thermostatic control of an electric heating circuit, to apply the Copeland automatic circuit to the Morris removable heating unit in substitution for a circuit manually controlled.\n To incorporate such a thermostatic control in a so-called 'wireless' or 'cordless' lighter was not to make an 'invention' or 'discovery' within the meaning of the patent laws. As we have shown, both the thermostatically controlled heating unit and the lighter with a removable plug bearing the heating unit were disclosed by the prior art. More must be done than to utilize the skill of the art in bringing old tools into new combinations. Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368; Pickering v. McCullough, \n104 \nU.S. 310\n, 14 Otto 310, 318; Thatcher Heating Co. v. Burtis, \n121 \nU.S. 286, 294\n, 7 S.Ct. 1034; Concrete Appliances Co. v.

Respondent, however, contends that wholly new functions were involved in Mead's conception, viz., relieving the operator of the necessity of manually holding the plug in closed-circuit position, and automatically and permanently opening the circuit when the heating coil was at the temperature predetermined for its proper use. And respondent argues, Mead's new combination had an entirely different mode of operation from any 'wireless' lighter then in existence and from any thermostatically controlled electric device. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n We may concede that the functions performed by Mead's combination were new and useful. But that does not necessarily make the device patentable. Under the statute, 35 U.S.C.  31, 35 U.S.C.A.  31, R.S.  4886, the device must not only be 'new and useful', it must also be an 'invention' or 'discovery'. Thompson v.

Greenwood, 11 How. 248, 267, decided in 1851, it has been recognized that if an improvement is to obtain the privileged position of a patent more ingenuity must be involved than the work of a mechanic skilled in the art.

Faber, \n92 \nU.S. 347\n, 2 Otto 347, 356, 357. The principle of the Hotchkiss case applies to the adaptation or combination of old or well known devices for new uses. Phillips v. Detroit, supra; Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, supra; Powers-Kennedy Contracting Corp. v. Concrete Mixing & Conveying Co., supra; Electric Cable Joint Co. v. Brooklyn Edison Co., \n292 \nU.S. 69\n, 54 S.Ct. 586; Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc. v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., supra; Textile Machine Works v.

That is to say the new device, however useful it may be, must reveal the flash of creative genius not merely the skill of the calling. If it fails, it has not established its right to a private grant on the public domain.\n Tested by that principle Mead's device was not patentable. We cannot conclude that his skill in making this contribution reached the level of inventive genius which the Constitution, Art. I,  8, authorizes Congress to reward. He merely incorporated the well-known thermostat into the old 'wireless' lighter to produce a more efficient, useful and convenient article. Cf. Electric Cable Joint Co. v. Brooklyn Edison Co., supra. A new application of an old device may not be patented if the 'result claimed as new is the same in character as the original result' (Blake v. San Francisco, \n113 \nU.S. 679, 683\n, 5 S.Ct. 692, 694) even though the new result had not before been contemplated. Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Locomotive Engine Safety Truck Co., \n110 \nU.S. 490, 494\n, 4 S.Ct. 220, 222, and cases cited. Certainly the use of a thermostat to break a circuit in a 'wireless' cigar lighter is analogous to or the same in character as the use of such a device in electric heaters, toasters, or irons, whatever may be the difference in detail of design. In- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 92]\n\u00a0\n genuity was required to effect the adaptation, but no more than that to be expected of a mechanic skilled in the art.\n Strict application of that test is necessary lest in the constant demand for new appliances the heavy hand of tribute be laid on each slight technological advance in an art. The consequences of the alternative course were forcefully pointed out by Mr. Justice Bradley in Atlantic Works v. Brady, \n107 \nU.S. 192\n, 17 Otto 192, 200, 2 S.Ct. 225, 231: 'Such an indiscriminate creation of exclusive privileges tends rather to obstruct than to stimulate invention. It creates a class of speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real advancement of the art. It embarrasses the honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of concealed liens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexatious accountings for profits made in good faith.' Cf. Mr. Justice Campbell dissenting in Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330, 344, 345, 347; Hamilton, Patents and Free Enterprise, Mon. No. 31, Investigation of Concentration of Economic Power, Temporary National Economic Committee, 76th Cong., 3d Sess ., ch. VIII (1941).\n Such considerations prevent any relaxation of the rule of the Hotchkiss case as respondent would seem to desire.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n I concur in the result.\n I agree that the use of the well known thermostatically controlled heating circuit exemplified by Copeland, with the removable wireless heating unit plug of Morris, in substitution for the manually controlled circuit which had \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 93]\n\u00a0\n previously been used with the plug, exhibited no more than the skill of the art. The doubt which the court below resolved in favor of patentability because Copeland's invention was 'still-born' should, I think, have been resolved in favor of petitioners because Mead was likewise still-born so far as its substantial commercial success is concerned.\n The commercially successful structure for which respondent claims the protection of the Mead patent and which the court below thought satisfied a felt need, is not the structure described by Mead. Both embody the combination of a thermostatically controlled heating circuit with a heating unit borne on a removable wireless plug and used as a means to close the circuit. But they differ structurally in a number of particulars.\n To mention only the more important, Mead showed a rotatable socket which is turned by manually rotating the plug when placed in the socket, so as to close the heating circuit. A laterally extending pin projecting from the side of the plug in the Mead structure engages with a spring latch outside the socket to hold the plug and socket in the circuit closing position to which they have been rotated until the latch is released by the thermostatic control, thus permitting the plug and the socket, which is activated by a spring, to rotate back to the open circuit position. The base required for the accommodation of the rotating socket and its externally operated mechanism was large and cumbersome. Respondent's commercial structure, like the alleged infringing device, utilizes a fixed socket within which the thermostatic circuit control is located and into which the heat unit carrying plug may be inserted without necessity of rotating it as in the case of the rotating plug with the projecting pin shown by Mead. The thermostatically controlled circuit is closed by pressing the plug further into the socket, the plug being restored to an open circuit position by a spring carried on \n\n[314 \nU.S. 84, 94]\n\u00a0\n the plug, when the latch maintaining the closed circuit is thermostatically released.\n The commercially exploited device because of the differences in its structure from that shown by Mead is the more compact and easily operated. Its utility as a lighter to be located on the dash of an automobile, which is said to be the merit of the Mead invention, is obvious. If the improvements resulting in such utility involved invention it is not the invention of Mead. If they exhibited only the skill of the art their success cannot be relied on to establish invention by Mead, who did not show or make them. The case is therefore not one for the application of the doctrine that commercial success or the manifest satisfaction of a felt need will turn the scale in favor of invention.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '2.

No issue, however, is raised under the assignment statute. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Respondent argues that Mead's combination was different from any prior thermostatic device because in the latter the operation of the thermostat was placed either under the control of some other thing such as the sole plate of an electric iron or under the control of an auxiliary resistance. The point is that in Mead's combination the effective operation of the thermostat was placed under the sole control of the temperature of the working resistance. We agree, however, with the court below that any such difference was merely one of detail of design on which Mead's invention cannot rest. In any case, it is the temperature created in the vicinity of the thermostat that is effective. The manner in which it is transmitted to the thermostat does not rise to the dignity of a patentable device. \n\n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCURRY v.

Lapsley, both of Montgomery, Ala ., for petitioners.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Acting Solicitor General, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 14, 16]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a companion case to State of Alabama v. King & Boozer and United States, \n314 \nU.S. 1\n, 62 S.Ct. 43, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day. It presents the question whether, by the cost-plus contract involved in the King & Boozer case, the contractors, who are respondents here, are immune from the use tax imposed by the Alabama statute, Act No. 67, General Acts of Alabama, 1939, p. 96, Code 1940, Tit. 51, s 787 et seq., because the materials with respect to the use of which the tax was laid, were ordered by the contractors and used by them in the performance of their contract with the Government.\n Section II of the taxing act, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  788, provides: '( a) An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased at retail ... for storage, use or other consumption in this state at the rate of two per cent (2%) of the sales price of such property, ... (b ) ... Every person storing, using or otherwise consuming in this State, tangible personal property purchased at retail shall be liable for the tax imposed by this act ....' Section III, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  789, exempts from the operation of the statute the storage, use or other consumption of property, the sale of which is taxed by other provisions of the statutes, and the storage, use or consumption of property, taxation of which is prohibited by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n Petitioner, Commissioner of Revenue for the State, assessed and collected from the contractors a tax on their use or consumption, within the state, of a quantity of roofing which they purchased outside the state and caused to be shipped to the camp site within the state, where they used it in the performance of their construction contract with the Government. The present suit was brought by the United States and the contractors in the state circuit court against petitioner, individually and as Commissioner, for a declaratory judgment determining the tax \n\n[314 \nU.S. 14, 17]\n\u00a0\n liability of the contractors and for a decree ordering refund of the tax paid by the contractors. The lawfulness of the tax was challenged specifically on the ground that the plaintiffs, respondents here, are exempt from the tax by the provisions of the state statute and are immune from it, because the use and consumption of the roofing by the contractors as agents or instrumentalities of the United States is constitutionally immune from taxation.\n The circuit court sustained the tax, declaring that it was laid upon the contractors by the statute and that they were not constitutionally immune from the tax because of their use of the purchased property in performance of their contract with the United States. The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed, 3 So.2d 582, holding that the tax infringed the constitutional immunity of the United States, for reasons stated in its opinion in King & Boozer v. State of Alabama, 3 So.2d 572. We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 599\n, 62 S.Ct. 118, 86 L.Ed. --, so that we might consider this with the King & Boozer case.\n Since the Supreme Court of Alabama rested its decision on the constitutional ground and not upon the inapplicability of the taxing statute to the contractors, we assume for present purposes, as we take it the state court assumed, that the contractors are subject to the tax but for the asserted Government immunity, and that upon the correct interpretation of the Alabama statute they would have been subject to the tax if their cost-plus contract had been with a private individual. Cf. Felt & Tarrant Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 167\n, 59 S.Ct. 389; Department of Treasury v. Wood Corp., \n313 \nU.S. 62\n, 61 S.Ct. 885\n\n\n For the reasons stated at length in our opinion in the King & Boozer case we think that the contractors, in purchasing and bringing the building material into the state and in appropriating it to their contract with the Government, were not agents or instrumentalities of the Gov- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 14, 18]\n\u00a0\n ernment; and they are not relieved of the tax, to which they would otherwise be subject, by reason of the fact that they are Government contractors. If the state law lays the tax upon them rather than the individual with whom they enter into a cost-plus contract like the present one, then it affects the Government, like the individual, only as the economic burden is shifted to it through operation of the contract. As pointed out in the opinion in the King & Boozer case, by concession of the Government and on authority, the Constitution, without implementation by Congressional legislation, does not prohibit a tax upon Government contractors because its burden is passed on economically by the terms of the contract or otherwise as a part of the construction cost to the Government.\n Upon the record as it comes to us we are not called upon to determine whether the taxing statute is applicable to transactions of the contractors on the camp site, a government reservation. We decide only the question passed upon by the Supreme Court of Alabama, that if the statute is applicable to and taxes the contractors upon a cost-plus contract like the present, if entered into with a private person, they are not immune from the tax when, as here, the contract is with the Government.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEPARTMENT OF TREASURY OF STATE OF INDIANA v.

Hutchinson, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioners.\n Mr. Harry T. Ice, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by respondent, The Wood Preserving Corporation, to recover taxes collected from it by the Department of Treasury of the State of Indiana under the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933. The District Court denied recovery and its judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the ground that the taxes were invalid under the Federal Constitution as laid upon income received outside the State and as constituting an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce. 7 Cir., 114 F.2d 922. In view of the asserted conflict with applicable decisions of this Court, certiorari was granted, February 3, 1941, \n312 \nU.S. 671\n, 61 S.Ct. 613, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The facts were found in accordance with the stipulation of the parties. Respondent is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is qualified to do business in Indiana but has no agents or employees within that State except as specified. Respondent is engaged in the business of treating railroad ties by creosoting them and also in the business of purchasing and selling ties. It does not, however, sell ties save to those with whom it has a contract for treatment.\n The taxes in question were for the years 1934, 1935 and 1936. The taxes were laid upon respondent's gross receipts from the sale of ties to the Baltimore and Ohio \n\n[313 \nU.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Company in accordance with certain contracts. One contract required the Railroad Company to deliver for treatment 600,000 ties annually to a treatment plant at Finney, Ohio, belonging (through a subsidiary) to respondent. The other provided for the sale of raw ties to the Railroad Company, delivered f.o.b. cars on the railroad tracks; also for treatment of ties at another plant to be operated by respondent (under lease from the Railroad Company) in West Virginia. A supplemental agreement required respondent to ship all ties delivered to the railroad in territory west of the Ohio River, including Indiana, to the plant at Finney, Ohio, for treatment. Respondent sold to the Railroad Company no ties that were not to be treated at one or the other of its plants before use.\n The course of business, so far as material here, was as follows: Respondent itself produced no ties in Indiana. Requisitions for ties were issued from the Railroad Company's office in Baltimore and were accepted at respondent's office in Marietta, Ohio, by telephone or mail. Respondent then procured the ties from local producers in Indiana through communications by telephone or mail from its Marietta office. The Indiana vendors delivered the ties at loading points on the railroad in Indiana. When the ties were ready, an inspector for the Railroad Company and respondent's agent met at the loading point in Indiana, and as the ties were examined with respect to compliance with specifications, those accepted by the railroad inspector were loaded on freight cars furnished by the Railroad Company at the loading point. The inspection and loading were simultaneous. Respondent paid the Indiana producers only for ties which were thus accepted. Respondent's agent made out bills of lading with respondent as consignor and the Railroad Company's Chief Engineer of Maintenance at Finney, Ohio, as consignee, and the ties were \n\n[313 \nU.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n carried to Finney, Ohio, for treatment. Respondent paid no freight to the Railroad Company for that transportation. Respondent's office at Marietta mailed weekly invoices to the Railroad Company at its Baltimore office for the ties sold and delivered to the Railroad Company and monthly reports of such invoices were made to respondent's main office at Pittsburgh. All payments for ties were made to respondent's Pittsburgh office and were there deposited in bank.\n The taxes in question were laid by the Indiana authorities on the receipts which respondent derived from the sale of the untreated ties. These receipts did not include charges for the creosoting treatment; those charges were separately billed by respondent's subsidiary when the treatment was completed.\n Section 2 of the Indiana Taxing Act of 1933, the text of which is set forth in the margin,1 provides for a tax upon gross income 'derived from sources within the State of Indiana' of all nonresident persons and corporations. The court below (114 F.2d 926), has held that under this statute the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n thing taxed was 'the receipt of gross income' and as the income in question was received by respondent in Pennsylvania, it was beyond the jurisdiction of Indiana; that, if the contrary theory of the taxing officials was sound, still the tax was invalid because no method was provided for allocating the tax to the income derived from that part of the business transacted within Indiana; and, further, that the transactions in question 'were had in interstate commerce', that the tax discriminated against that commerce and for that reason was void.\n As to the first point, the court relied upon our decision in Adams Manufacturing Company v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 117 A.L.R. 429. That was a case under the same taxing act of Indiana, but there the tax was applied to gross receipts derived by an Indiana corporation from sales in other States of goods manufactured in Indiana. We observed that the tax is not an excise for the privilege of domicile 'since it is levied upon the gross income of nonresidents from sources within the State'. The point of the decision was that 'the tax is what it purports to be-a tax upon gross receipts from commerce', and that the tax was there laid upon receipts from sales to customers in other States and abroad which constituted interstate and foreign commerce. Id., 304 U.S. at pages 310, 311, 58 S.Ct. at pages 915, 916.\n The present question is as to the validity of the tax upon receipts 'derived from sources within the State',2 that is, under Section 2 of the Act, from activities which petitioners insist were intratate. If petitioners are right in this contention there can be no doubt that Indiana had authority to lay the tax. Underwood Typewriter \n\n[313 \nU.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n Co. v.

Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229, decided December 16, 1940. In that view, it cannot be said that respondent had a constitutional right to escape that burden by arranging to have the proceeds of its intrastate transactions paid to it in another State. Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, supra, 254 U.S. at page 120, 41 S.Ct. at page 46; Continental Assurance Co. v. Tennessee, \n311 \nU.S. 5\n, 61 S.Ct. 1.\n Further, as the sole subject of the challenged tax is the income derived from respondent's sales to the Railroad Company there is no occasion for apportionment. The creosoting operations in Ohio, and the income derived from them, were not involved. And the fact that the ties which were sold to the Railroad Company were purchased by respondent through orders given to the Indiana producers from respondent's Marietta office cannot affect the authority of Indiana to tax the receipts from intrastate activities of respondent in its dealings with the Railroad Company. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 140; Banker Brothers Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n222 \nU.S. 210\n, 32 S.Ct. 38; Wiloil Corporation v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 169, 175\n, 55 S.Ct. 358, 360.\n As to these dealings, it appears that respondent received in Indiana the ties it purchased from the local producers and that respondent sold and delivered these ties in Indiana to the Railroad Company. The fact that the delivery by the producers to respondent and respondent's delivery to the Railroad Company took place at the same time is not important. Respondent was in Indiana acting through its agent at the designated points on the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 62, 68]\n\u00a0\n railroad line. The Railroad Company was at the same points represented by its inspector. The ties brought there by the producers were then examined and those found by the inspector to be in accordance with specifications were accepted. In these transactions, respondent through its agent at once accepted from its vendors the ties which the Railroad Company f und satisfactory and then and there sold and delivered these ties to the Railroad Company. These were local transactions-sales and deliveries of particular ties by respondent to the Railroad Company in Indiana. The transactions were none the less intrastate activities because the ties thus sold and delivered were forthwith loaded on the railroad cars to go to Ohio for treatment. The contract providing for that treatment called for the treatment of ties to be delivered by the Railroad Company at the Ohio plant, and the ties bought by the Railroad Company in Indiana, as above stated, were transported and delivered by the Railroad Company to that treatment plant. Respondent did not pay the freight for that transportation and the circumstance that the billing was in its name as consignor is not of consequence in the light of the facts showing the completed delivery to the Railroad Company in Indiana.

Joseph P. McNamara and Joseph W. Hutchinson, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioners.\n Mr. Earl B. Barnes, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court, has held that respondent, Ingram-Richardson Manufacturing Company, is entitled to a refund f a tax levied under the Indiana Gross Income Tax Law,1 upon the ground of the invalidity of the tax under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, article 1,  8, cl. 3. 7 Cir., 114 F.2d 889. We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict with applicable decisions of this Court, February 3, 1941, \n312 \nU.S. 671\n, 61 S.Ct. 613, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The tax was for $5,410.202 and was laid upon respondent's gross receipts derived as follows:\n Respondent, an Indiana corporation, has a factory at Frankfort in that State where it manufactures enamel, both in a granular form, known as frit, and in a hard, finished form fused with metal articles. In the instant case the enamel was fused with metal parts used in stoves and refrigerators manufactured by respondent's customers in various States other than Indiana. Respondent's traveling salesmen solicited orders from such customers pursuant to which respondent transported by its trucks the stove and refrigerator parts belonging to its customers from their plants to its own plant for enameling. There \n\n[313 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n the enameling was done by the process set forth in the findings, and respondent then hauled the enameled parts back to its customers' factories. Respondent thereafter billed its customers for the enameling and remittances were made to respondent by mail. The value of the metal parts as units after the completion of the enameling process was from two and one-half to three times the value of the respective parts before the enameling.\n Respondent's contention, as set forth in its complaint and as still asserted, is that these transactions constituted sales of the hard, finished enamel in interstate commerce. The Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with that contention and held that the income in question was derived from services. We are in accord with that view.\n In the alternative, respondent contends that the services paid for included the solicitation of orders by respondent's agents and the execution of contracts in other States, interstate communications by mail, telephone and telegraph, and also the transportation by respondent of the stove and refrigerator parts from and to places in other States.\n The enameling process was an activity performed at respondent's plant in Indiana and the gross receipts therefrom were taxable by Indiana under its Gross Income Tax Law. See Department of Treasury of Indiana v. Wood Preserving Corporation, \n313 \nU.S. 62\n, 61 S.Ct. 885, 85 L.Ed. --. The fact that the orders for the enameling were obtained by respondent's agents and contracts were executed outside Indiana did not make the enameling process other than an intrastate activity and any the less a proper subject for the application of the taxing statute. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944.\n But the court below has held that there was included in the service rendered by respondent the transportation by its trucks of the stove and refrigerator parts from and to the customers' plants in other States. The court thought \n\n[313 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n that the reasoning of our opinion in Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434\n, 59 S.Ct. 325, applied. That case, however, presented a different situation. The business there was that of a marketing agent for a federation of fruit growers and the state tax was measured by the gross receipts of the taxpayer from the business of marketing fruit shipped from the taxing State to the places of sale in other States and foreign countries. We found that the entire service for which the compensation was paid was 'in aid of the shipment and sale of merchandise in that commerce' (inter tate and foreign) and hence the service was held to be within the protection of the commerce clause. Id., 305 U.S. page 437, 59 S.Ct. page 327. Here, on the contrary, the entire service was in aid of the enameling business conducted within the State. The transportation of the metal parts to and from Indiana were but incident to that intrastate business, as was the circulation of appellants' magazine in States other than the taxing State in the Western Live Stock case, supra, 303 U.S. page 254, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944.\n Moreover, if the transportation of the metal parts were regarded as an item of service for which a deduction should have been allowed, we think that it was the duty of respondent, in view of the fact that it was conducting an intrastate business clearly subject to the tax, to claim the deduction and show the amount which should be allowed. It does not appear that respondent did either. Respondent made its claim for a total exemption from the tax upon the ground that it was laid upon interstate sales, a contention which it has failed to support.\n The State contends, citing provisions of the taxing act, that the legislature of Indiana contemplated that the taxpayer would reflect in the tax return any deductions claimed, making a separation between taxable and non-taxable items and that the tax return itself provided a method for claiming any deductions to which \n\n[313 \nU.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer thought itself entitled. Respondent insists that the Act did not provide a method of apportionment. In the absence of an effort on the part of respondent to present a claim for deduction and to have the state authorities pass upon the question of deduction or apportionment, as distinguished from its claim for a total exemption, we are not called upon to attempt to resolve the question of state law.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 of Chapter 50 of the Acts of Indiana of 1933. 11 Burns' Indiana Statutes, Sec. 64-2602.

Darby, Jr., of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. William H. Davis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n July 7, 1927, Harold A. Wheeler applied for a patent for a circuit designed automatically to control the amplitude of amplified signal voltage in modulated carriercurrent signalling systems. Patent No. 1,879, 863 issued September 27, 1932, to the respondent as assignee of Wheeler.\n A suit was brought in the Eastern District of New York for infringement of Claims 1, 5, 6, and 10.1 The District Court held the claims invalid for want of invention. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decree. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n September 26, 1934, while the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals was pending, respondent applied for \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 261]\n\u00a0\n a reissue. After the decision of the Circuit Court of App als respondent redrafted the claims and, October 29, 1935, a reissue patent, no. 19,744, was granted. The present suit was thereafter instituted against the petitioner for infringement of all the thirteen claims of the reissue except Claim 8. The District Court held the patent valid and infringed and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n3\n The petition for certiorari presented, inter alia, the question whether the decision conflicts with that of the Second Circuit.\n Control of the amplification of a modulated carrier-wave signal is useful in connection with transmitting and receiving apparatus and, in the original patent, Wheeler claimed his system as respects both. In his specifications, however, he confined himself to its application to receivers, wherein its function is to control the volume of sound emitted from the loud speaker. In broadcasting, a high frequency wave, known as a carrier wave, is impressed with another low frequency wave or, as it is said, modulated. The high frequency, or signal, wave is picked up by the antenna of a receiver and conducted thence to the input of an amplifying device which consists of an amplifier tube, or several of them in series. These tubes have three electrodes, a cathode, an anode, and a grid, and are called triodes. The signal wave, as amplified, is carried from the output of the amplifying device to the input of a vacuum tube, known as a detector or rectifier, which transmutes the alternating current into a unidirectional or direct pulsating current. This is led to audio tubes which enhance its volume, and thence to a loud speaker. Such a receiving set has other equipment for selecting signals of varying frequency and adjusting the amplification of the audio waves, with which we need not concern ourselves. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 262]\n\u00a0\n One of the problems of the art has arisen from variations of the received signals. When the set is tuned from a weak signal to a much stronger one the tendency is for potential to build up in the last amplifying tube, which results in what is known as blasting in the loud speaker. Often the same signal varies in intensity. Weakening may result in fading, whereby the sound production weakens or disappears; and strengthening may beget distortion of the sounds emitted.\n Wheeler essayed to obviate these objectionable features. It was known that the amplification of the carrier signal could be controlled by increasing or decreasing the potential upon the grid of a triode amplifier. Wheeler proposed automatically to vary this potential so as to increase or decrease the degree of amplification and thus hold it at a substantially predetermined level. To this end he provided means to increase the negative potential upon the anode of the detector tube in step with the increased strength of the signal and to conduct a direct current from that anode to the grid electrode of one or more of the amplifying tubes. Thus an increase of the strength of the signal would automatically increase the negative potential on the grid of the amplifier and decrease the amplification; the reverse result would be effected if the signal weakened. The means he adopted to accomplish this were alternative.\n According to one method the signal was amplified to a comparatively high voltage, and a diode used as a detector. The output voltage from the detector was approximately as great as that of the amplified signal. By coupling the cathode and anode of the detector and inserting a resistance in the coupling he could maintain the anode of the detector slightly negative at all times. Since he connected all the cathodes in parallel the cathode of the detector was maintained at substantially the same potential as the cathode of the radio frequency am- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 263]\n\u00a0\n plifier. By this means the anode of the detector could be maintained normally negative relative to at least a part of the amplifier cathode. When the rectified current flowing t rough the detector circuit increased with the strength of the signal there was developed at the output terminal of the detector circuit, through the operation of the resistance, which was also connected between the anode of the detector and the grid of the amplifier, an increase of negative voltage which, through the direct current connection from the terminal of the detector circuit to the grid of the amplifier, increased the negative potential thereof, and lessened the signal amplification. Conversely, if the strength of the signal current decreased, the negative potential developed upon the anode of the detector correspondingly decreased and there was a decreased inhibition of the amplifying power of the signal amplifier.\n In his alternative method, he accomplished the same result with a triode detector. In this arrangement he maintained a negative voltage on the grid of the detector triode by the use of a battery and a potentiometer connected across the cathode of the detector tube. The output circuit of the detector included a resistance connected between the anode of the detector and the common 'B' battery of a radio set. A direct connection was provided from the output terminal of this circuit to the grid of the signal amplifier for impressing thereon the potential developed on the anode of the detector. The amplified signal voltage operated to bring into play the voltage of the battery which created the potential on the anode of the detector.\n According to the specifications, each arrangement had advantages and disadvantages. The diode detector used in the first furnished no amplification but it dispensed with the necessity of an additional battery or source of current supply. The second not only required an addi- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 264]\n\u00a0\n tional battery but an adjustment between the voltage delivered by the two batteries which cooperate to vary the negative potential on the anode of the triode detector.\n Both arrangements include devices to prevent the passage from the detector to the audio tubes, and from the detector to the grid of the amplifier tubes, of undesired forms of electrical energy and both embrace means to provide a time constant with respect to the transmission of negative potential from the anode of the detector to the grid of the amplifier. None of these are now asserted to be novel or to constitute a part of the asserted invention.\n In Wheeler's drawings and specifications he exhibited both methods and said of them that they operate 'substantially in the same manner', and again that they are 'substantially similar in operation.' In his application he presented claims which did not specify the kind of detector to be used, and others calling for a diode. All of the latter were disallowed and he concurred in their cancellation without prejudice. he had asserted in prosecuting his application that 'the invention can obviously be used with any kind of detector.' Nine claims were finally allowed. Just before the patent issued, and nearly five years after original application, Wheeler presented a number of additional claims. In two he described the detector as a diode and in one of these he denominated the resistance connected between the detector anode and the amplifier cathode as a 'high resistance.' He asserted that these two claims were 'practically the same as allowed Claim 11', which became Claim 1 of the patent as issued and specified no particular form of detector tube and no high resistance. They were allowed as Claims 10 and 11 of the patent as issued.\n In the Abrams suit only Claims 1, 5, 6 and 10 were in issue. The contention was that the invention was a broad one covering the principle of automatic volume control by means of any form of circuit. The defendant insisted \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 265]\n\u00a0\n that the patent involved no invention in view of the prior art and cited patents issued before Wheeler's date of conception4 and others issued before the patent in suit on applications antedating his date of invention and pending when his application was filed. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Some of these were for transmission systems and some for receiving systems. Several disclosed automatic amplification control. All constituted prior art. 6 Hazeltine attempted to distinguish them from the Wheeler patent in three respects. It contended that Wheeler's patent was limited to the receiving art and that prior inventions addressed to automatic amplification control in transmission did not constitute anticipation. The District Court answered that Wheeler's patent was not limited but was for any modulated wave carrier signalling system. Hazeltine also insisted that some of the prior art dealt with amplification control in amplifiers beyond the detector rather than in those through which the controlled current passed before it reached the detector, as in Wheeler. The District Court was unable to find any such distinction from the prior art in the Wheeler claims. Finally Hazeltine urged that the time constand device was not found in the prior art cited. The District Court held that if any of these alleged differences constituted invention on Wheeler's part the claims did not disclose them, and that to sustain Hazeltine's contention would be to rewrite the claims. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 266]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals took a more liberal view of the Wheeler patent as evidenced by the claims in connection with the specifications. It assumed, for the purposes of decision, that Wheeler's patent was limited to receivers. It recognized the difference between the feed of the negative potential back to the radio frequency amplifiers instead of forward but it found no invention in the change. It held there was no invention in the provision of a time constant. That court, therefore, found that all Wheeler did was to take certain obvious steps in an already crowded art, which steps were based upon various disclosures of that art, and that the changes he made did not amount to invention. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the mention of a diode detector in Claim 10 represented no new inventive element since at least one of the patents in the prior art,-that of Heising,-disclosed the use of such a tube in an automatic amplification control system.\n Confronted with these holdings Hazeltine, as has been stated, rewrote the specifications and claims in its application for reissue. It eliminated all reference to the use of a triode detector in its drawings and specifications and limited them to a system employing a diode. Certain of the claims of the old patent, however, were retained which make no distinction between a diode and a triode since they refer merely to a detector. Hazeltine also altered the specifications to refer particularly to a diode and a high resistance. Such a high resistance had been claimed as part of the invention in Claim 11 of the original patent, which claim was not in suit in the Abrams case. This fact is significant for, if the high resistance had been considered novel or essential to the invention, it is hard to see why suit was not founded on Claim 11, the only claim which disclosed it.\n It is evident that Hazeltine found it necessary to abandon its broad claims to a monopoly of automatic \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 267]\n\u00a0\n volume control circuits and to limit the claims to an alleged improvement in such circuits. The petitioner insists that the effort is unavailing for the reason that the patent, as defined in the reissue, fails to disclos invention in view of the prior art.\n As is admitted, automatic amplification control was old in the art when Wheeler made his alleged invention. The invention must then consist in the conception of improved means for obtaining such control. The courts below have found invention in the combination in a radio receiver of a diode detector with a high resistance connected between the anode of the detector and the cathode of the amplifying tube and a direct connection between the anode and the grid of the amplifier for impressing negative potential upon the latter, thus obtaining from the signal voltage a so- called linear response to the variations in the amplitude of the signal current. This combination, they held, was such an advance in the art as to constitute invention. We think the decision below conflicts with that in the Abrams case and fails to give due weight to the disclosures of the prior art.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals distinguishes from Wheeler's conception automatic amplification control used in receivers, such control used in transmitters, such control used for other purposes than volume control of audio waves, or accomplished by the use of a triode or by means other than those which employ the signal current itself and also sets apart amplification control which does not produce a linear response.\n There can be no question that the patents cited as prior art disclose the accomplishment of linear response. The curve exhibited in Wheeler's drawings to illustrate the result of the use of his system is duplicated in similar curves by Affel and Friis. It cannot be claimed, therefore, that Wheeler has accomplished a new result. At most he can have obtained an old result by new means. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 268]\n\u00a0\n The prior art discloses that automatic amplification control is useful both in receiving and transmitting devices for the accomplishment of various ends, including volume control. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the limitation of Wheeler's claims to receivers of radio signals would not spell invention.\n The respondent insists, and the courts below held, that the reissue patent is limited to claiming a diode detector and a high resistance connected between the detector anode and the amplifier cathode and a direct connection of anode with cathode. Passing the fact that Claims 2, 3, and 6 in suit embrace any sort of detector without limitation, and assuming that the reissue is limited as suggested, it remains that practically all of the patents cited from the prior art employ a resistance to impress the required potential on the amplifier grid for controlling amplification and that two of them, those of Heising and Slepian, disclose the use of a resistance in connection with a diode.\n The court below distinguishes Heising on the ground that his purpose was not to control the volume of audio waves but rather to use less current in the radio frequency amplifiers of a transmitter. We hold, as did the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, that these distinctions do not negative anticipation by Heising. With respect to Slepian, the court below remarks that his device was intended to accomplish a different end. This is true for his object was to provide a receiving system which would admit of an extremely high amplification of received signal impulses. But the use of automatic amplification control, whatever the end in view, is the critical consideration.\n The court below states that neither Heising nor Slepian succeeded in producing automatic amplification control. In this the court overlooked the uncontradicted testimony \n\n[313 \nU.S. 259, 269]\n\u00a0\n of the respondent's expert, Dr. Hazeltine, who flatly testified that each of them does produce it. And Heising produces it from the signal current by the use of a diode detector, a 'high resistance' inserted between the anode thereof and the cathode of the amplifier and a direct current connection from the detector anode to the amplifier cathode.\n We think the court below was in error i stating that all the workers in the prior art obtained their control potential from an additional battery whereas Wheeler obtained it from signal energy. This is not true of Heising or Slepian.\n Nor can Wheeler claim novelty, as the court held, in the production of a linear response. While Friis obtained energy for the production of potential from a battery, he discloses a resulting linear response comparable to that claimed by Wheeler. If, as is now asserted, the insertion of a high resistance between the anode of the detector and the cathode of the amplifier is an integral part of Wheeler's conception, it may be noted that a resistance to develop a potential to be carried to the amplifier grid is disclosed by prior inventors, including Heising, Friis, Slepian, Affel and Evans and several of them describe it as Wheeler does, namely, a 'high resistance'.\n We conclude that Wheeler accomplished an old result by a combination of means which, singly or in similar combination, were disclosed by the prior art and that, notwithstanding the fact he was ignorant of the pending applications which antedated his claimed date of invention and eventuated into patents, he was not in fact the first inventor, since his advance over the prior art, if any, required only the exercise of the skill of the art.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hazeltine Corp. v.

The following facts appear from proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals for the District of Columbia:\n The respondent in No. 58, a single man, first came to the District of Columbia in 1935 to work as an economist in the Treasury Department, and was blanketed into Civil Service in that position in July, 1938. He came here from Detroit, Michigan, and has ever since continued to \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n be a registered voter and has voted in the elections and primaries in Wayne County, Michigan. He was born in New London, Connecticut, in 1905, and when five years old moved with his parents to Los Angeles, California where he resided until 1926. when he removed to Berkeley, California. His parents live in California. In 1929 he completed his studies at Brown University and immediately thereafter accepted employment in a trust company in Detroit, Michigan, of which one of his former professors at Brown was vice president. While in Detroit, respondent lived first in a rooming house and later in an apartment. He owns no property there. In the District of Columbia he lives in an apartment, which he has furnished himself. His present employment pays him $6,500 a year, while that which he left in Detroit paid but $6,000. He testified before the Board of Tax Appeals that he does not think he would improve his condition by returning to Detroit, but that 'It is the place to which I will return if I ever become disemployed by the Government, which I hope will not happen ....' Although he has no present connection with the trust company, he believes that he could go back with it if he should return to Detroit. If a better position than he now has should be offered in a city other than Detroit, he 'very likely would' accept it, despite a 'preference for Detroit' based on a belief that he 'would fit in more easily' there.\n Respondent claimed that Detroit was his 'legal residence' and that he was not domiciled in the District of Columbia. The Board of Tax Appeals for the District of Columbia found 'as a fact' that when he came to Washington in 1935 he 'had an intention to remain and make his home in the District of Columbia for an indefinite period of time; and that such intention has ever since, and still does remain with him; and that if he has any intention to return and make his home in Detroit, it is a floating intention.' The Board held, however, 'as \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n matter of law,' that on December 31, 1939, the last day of the taxable year, petitioner was not domiciled in the District of Columbia, believing that it was compelled to do so by the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Sweeney v. District of Columbia, 72 App.D.C. 30, 113 F.2d 25, 129 A.L.R. 1370, certiorari denied, \n310 \nU.S. 631\n, 60 S.Ct. 1082\n\n\n The respondent in No. 59 lived in the District of Columbia for twenty- six years after coming here from Pennsylvania in 1914 to accept a clerical position of indefinite tenure under Civil Service in the Patent Office. He was then on a year's leave of absence from a railroad by which he was employed, but continued in the Civil Service to the time of hearing, becoming Chief Clerk of the Personnel and Organization Division of the National Guard Bureau, War Department, with offices in Washington. Single when he came, in 1917 he married a native of Washington, who died in 1935 without children. Shortly after their marriage the couple purchased as a home, premises at 1426 Massachusetts Avenue, S.E., in the District of Columbia, in which respondent still lives. In about 1925, he purchased a lot at 'Selby on the Bay' in nearby Maryland, and before his wife's death he bought a building lot in the District of Columbia, acting on his wife's pleas for a summer place and a better residence. He agreed with his wife that on his retirement six months would be spent at Selby. He testified that he never desired to purchase the lot in the District of Columbia, but did so at the insistence of his wife. He put a 'For Sale' sign on it when she died, and both lots, which he still owns, are up for sale. He has deposits in three Washington financial institutions and owns first trust notes on property located in Maryland and Virginia.\n In 1915 respondent became a member of a Lutheran church in Washington, and has ever since been an active member, at one time serving as president of its Christian \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n Endeavor Society. He is a contributor to Washington charities, a member of the Motor Club of Washington, and of the Washington units of 'Tall Cedars of Lebanon' and the 'Mystic Shrine,' both identified with freemasonry. He has filed his federal income-tax returns with the Collector of Internal Revenue at Baltimore, and always paid to the District of Columbia an intangible property tax while that tax was in effect.\n Respondent had resided in Pennsylvania from birth until he left for Washington. He claimed as his 'legal residence' the residence of his parents in Harrisburg, where they still keep intact his room in which are kept some of his clothes and childhood toys. Though paying nothing as rent or for lodging, he has from time to time made presents of money to his parents. He has visited his parents' home in Harrisburg over week ends at least eight times a year, and has been there annually between Christmas and the New Year. A registered voter in Pennsylvania, he has voted in all its general elections since he became of age. He paid the Pennsylvania poll tax until it was superseded by an occupational tax, which he has also paid. Payment of such taxes was a prerequisite to voting.\n In 1912 respondent became a life member of the Robert Burns Lodge No. 464, Free and Accepted Masons, and of the Harrisburg Consistory, Scottish Rite, both Masonic bodies. While he resided in Harrisburg he was a member of the Bible Class of the Pine Street Presbyterian Church, which he still attends on visits there, and to which he made substantial contributions in 1939. He owns jointly with his father a note secured by a mortgage on Pennsylvania real estate. Respondent testified that he expected to retire from Civil Service in four years and intended then to sell his house and 'leave Washington.'\n The Board found 'as a fact' that at the end of one year after he came to the District in 1914 respondent 'had an \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 449]\n\u00a0\n intention to remain and make his home in the District of Columbia for an indefinite period of time and that intention remained with him, at least until the death of his wife.' As in No. 58, it considered itself bound by the Sweeney case, supra, and accordingly held 'as a matter of law' that the petitioner was not domiciled in the District on December 31, 1939, and never had been.\n The decisions in both cases were affirmed on review by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 73 App.D.C. 345, 119 F.2d 449; 73 App.D.C. 347, 119 F.2d 451. The cases were brought here on writs of certiorari because of the importance of the questions involved. \n313 \nU.S. 556\n, 61 S.Ct. 1103, 1104.\n Although the District of Columbia Income Tax Act made 'domicile' the fulcrum of the income tax, the first ever imposed in the District, it set forth no definition of that word. To ascertain its meaning we therefore consider the Congressional history of the Act, the situation with reference to which it was enacted, and the existing judicial precedents, with which Congress may be taken to have been familiar in at least a general way. United States v. Dickerson, \n310 \nU.S. 554, 562\n, 60 S.Ct. 1034, 1038.\n As introduced into and passed by the House of Representatives, the bill which, with amendments, became the Act, laid a tax upon income of residents from whatever source derived, and upon income of nonresidents from sources within the District, with a provision for credit for the payment of income taxes elsewhere. H.R. 6577, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.,  2( a), 4(a), 9(a), (b), D.C.Code Supp. V, T. 20,  980a(a), 980c(a), 980h(a, b). The bill was amended on the floor of the House to except 'Senators, Representatives, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, officers and employees of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.' 84 Cong. Rec. 7036. It was unacceptable to the Senate in this form, and it was agreed in conference that the tax should be levied 'upon every individual domiciled in the District of Columbia \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 450]\n\u00a0\n on the last day of the taxable year,' with no provision for credit for income taxes paid elsewhere. H.R. Rep. Nos. 1093, 1206, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3; Sen. Doc. No. 92, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3. This was agreed to by the Senate and by the House of Representatives, and became part of the Act under consideration.\n The conference agreement was presented to the Senate by Senator Overton, chairman of the Senate conferees, with the following explanation: 'Mr. President, I now call attention to the fact that the individual income tax is imposed only on those domiciled in the District of Columbia. It, therefore, necessarily excludes from its imposition all Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, the President of the United States, all Cabinet officers, and Federal employees who have been brought into the District from the various States of the Union to serve their country in the National Capital, provided such employees have not of their own volition surrendered their domiciles in the States and have voluntarily acquired domiciles within the District of Columbia.' 84 Cong. Rec. 8824. Senator Overton also stated: 'I took the position before the District of Columbia Committee and in conference that I would not support any legislation which would exempt Senators and Members of the House of Representatives and their official force from an income tax in the District of Columbia but would impose it on all others. I then took the position in conference that if we imposed an income tax only on those domiciled within the District, then we would be imposing it only on those who of their own volition had abandoned their domiciles in the States of their origin and had elected to make their permanent home or domicile here in the District of Columbia. Such persons, it may be justly contended, have no cause to complain against an income tax that is imposed upon them only because they have \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 451]\n\u00a0\n chosen to establish within the District of Columbia their permanent2 places of abode and to abandon their domiciles within the States.' 84 Cong. Rec. 8825.\n In the House, Representative Nichols, chairman of the House conferees, and also chairman of the House District Committee in charge of fiscal affairs, submitted the conference report and stated: 'Since the question of the effect of the word 'domicile' in this act has been raised, I think the House would probably like to have the legal definition read: 'Domicile is the place where one has his true, fixed, permanent home and principal establishment and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning, and where he exercises his political rights. \n3\n ... There must exist in combination the fact of residence and animus manendi-' which means residence and his intention to return (sic); so that under this definition he could certainly live in the District of Columbia and have his legal domicile in any other State in the United States.' 84 Cong.Rec. 8974.\n Representative Bates, another of the House conferees, stated in response to a question regarding the possibility of triple taxation, 'We raised that particular point (in conference) because we are much concerned about how those who come from our States would be affected by the income- tax provisions of the new law, and it was distinctly \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 452]\n\u00a0\n understood that in this bill there should be no triple taxation ....' 84 Cong.Rec. 8973.\n The unusual character of the National Gapital, making the income tax a 'very explosive and controversial item,'4 was vividly before the Congress, and must also be considered in construing the statute imposing the tax.\n The District of Columbia is an exceptional community. It is not a local municipal authority, but was established under the Constitution as the seat of the National Government. Those in Government service here are not engaged in local enterprise, although their service may be localized. Their work is that of the nation, and their pay comes not from local sources but from the whole country. Because of its character as a federal city, there is no local political constituency with whose activities those living in it may identify themselves as a symbol of their acceptance of a local domicile.\n Not all who flock here are birds of a feather. Some enter the Civil Service, finding tenure and pay there more secure than in private enterprise. Political ties are of no consequence in obtaining or maintaining their positions. At the other entreme are those who hold appointive office at the pleasure of the appointing officer. These latter, as well as appointive officers with definite but unprotected tenure, and all elective officers, usually owe their presence here to the intimate and influential part they have played in community life in one of the States.\n Relatively few persons here in any branch of the Government service can truthfully and accurately lay claim to an intention to sever themselves from the service on any exact date. Persons in all branches usually desire, quite naturally and properly, to continue family life and to have the comforts of a domestic establishment for whatever may be the term of their stay here. This is true of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 453]\n\u00a0\n many Senators and Congressmen, cited by Senator Overton as typical of those whom the limitation of the statute to persons 'domiciled' here 'necessarily excludes.'\n Turning to the judicial precedents for further guidance in construing 'domicile' as used in the statute, we find it generally recognized that one who comes to Washington to enter the Government service and to live here for its duration does not thereby acquire a new domicile. More than a century ago, Justice Parker of New Hampshire observed that 'It has generally been considered that persons appointed to public office under the authority of the United States, and taking up their residence in Washington for the purpose of executing the duties of such office, do not thereby, while engaged in the service of the government, lose their domicil in the place where they before resided, unless they intend on removing there to make Washington their permanent5 residence.' See Atherton v. Thornton, 8 N.H. 178, 180. By and large, subsequent cases have taken a like view. \n6\n It should also be observed \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 454]\n\u00a0\n that a policy against loss of domicile by sojourn in Washington is expressed in the constitutions and statutes of many states. \n7\n Of course no individual case, constitution, or statute is controlling, but the general trend of these authorities is a significant recognition that the distinctive character of Washington habitation for federal service is meaningful to those who are served as well as to those in the service.\n From these various data on Congressional intent, it is apparent that the present cases are not governed by the tests usually employed in cases where the element of federal service in the Federal City is not present. \n8\n We hold that a man does not acquire a domicile in the District simply by coming here to live for an indefinite period of time while in the Government service. A contrary decision would disregard the statements made on the floor of Congress as to the meaning of the statute, fail to give proper weight to the trend of judicial decisions, with which Congress should be taken to have been cognizant, and result in a wholesale finding of domicile on the part of Government servants quite obviously at variance with Congressional policy. Further, Congress did not intend that one living here indefinitely while in the Government service be held domiciled here simply because he does not maintain a domestic establishment at the place he hails from. Such a rule would result in taxing those unable to maintain two establishments, and exempting those able to meet such a burden-thus reversing the usual philosophy of income tax as one based on ability to pay.\n On the other hand, we hold that persons are domiciled here who live here and have no fixed and definite intent to return and make their homes where they were formerly \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 455]\n\u00a0\n domiciled. \n9\n A decision that the statute lays a tax only on those with an affirmative intent to remain here the rest of their days would be at odds with the prevailing concept of domicile, and would give the statute scope far narrower than the Congress must have intended.\n Cases falling clearly within such broad rules aside, the question of domicile is a difficult one of fact to be settled only by a realistic and conscientious review of the many relevant (and frequently conflicting) indicia of where a man's home10 is and according to the established modes of proof.\n The place where a man lives is properly taken to be his domicile until facts adduced establish the contrary. Ennis v. Smith, 14 How. 400, 423; Anderson v. Watt, \n138 \nU.S. 694, 706\n, 11 S.Ct. 449, 452. The taxing authority is warranted in treating as prima facie taxable any person quartered in the District on tax day whose status it deems doubtful. It is not an unreasonable burden upon the individual, who knows best whence he came, what he left behind, and his own attitudes, to require him to establish domicile elsewhere if he is to escape the tax.\n To hold taxable one who contends that he is not domiciled here, the Board need not find the exact time when the 'attitude and relationship of person to place' which constitute domicile, Texas v. Florida, \n306 \nU.S. 398, 411\n, 59 S.Ct. 563, 570, 830, 121 A.L.R. 1179, were \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 456]\n\u00a0\n formed, so long as it finds they were formed before the tax day. What was at first a firm intent to return may have withered gradually in consequence of dissolving associations elsewhere and growing interests in the District. It is common experience that this process usually is unmarked by any dramatic or even sharply defined episode. The taxing authority need not find just when the intent was finally dissipated; it is enough that it finds that this has happened before the tax day.\n If one has at any time become domiciled here, it is his burden to establish any change of status upon which he relies to escape the tax. Anderson v. Watt, supra, 138 U.S. at page 706, 11 S.Ct. at page 452.\n In order to retain his former domicile, one who comes to the District to enter Government service must always have a fixed and definite intent to return and take up his home there when separated from the service. A mere sentimental attachment will not hold the old domicile. And residence in the District with a nearly equal readiness to go back where one came from or to any other community offering advantages upon the termination of service is not enough.\n One's testimony with regard to his intention is of course to be given full and fair consideration, but is subject to the infirmity of any self- serving declaration, and may frequently lack persuasiveness or even be contradicted or negatived by other declarations and inconsistent acts.\n Whether or not one votes where he claims domicile is highly relevant but by no means controlling. \n11\n Each state prescribes for itself the qualifications of its voters, and each has its own machinery for determining compliance with such qualifications. A vote cast without challenge and adjudication may indicate only laxity of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 457]\n\u00a0\n state officials, and even an adjudication of the right to vote cannot preclude the levy of a tax by an arm of the Federal Government. On the other hand, failure to vote elsewhere is, of course, not conclusive that domicile is here.\n Also of great significance is the nature of the position which brings one to or keeps him in the service of the Government: whether continuous or emergency, special or war-time in character; whether requiring fixed residence in the District or only intermittent stays; whether entailing monetary sacrifices or betterment; and whether political or non-political. Those dependent upon the action of a local constituency on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November are of course loath to leave their local identifications behind when taking up Government duties in Washington.\n Of course the manner of living here, taken in connection with one's station in life, is relevant. Did he hire a furnished room or establish himself by the purchase of a house? Or did he rent a house or apartment? Has he brought his family and dependents here? Has he brought his goods? What relations has he to churches, clubs, lodges, and investments that identify him with the District?\n All facts which go to show the relations retained to one's former place of abode are relevant in determining domicile. What bridges have been kept and what have been burned? Does he retain a place of abode there, or is there a family home with which he retains identity? Does he have investments in local property or enterprise which attach him to the community? What are his affiliations with the professional, religious, and fraternal life of the community, and what other associations does he cling to? How permanent was his domicile in the community from which he came? Had it long been a family seat, or was he there a bird of passage? Would a return to \n\n[314 \nU.S. 441, 458]\n\u00a0\n the old community pick up threads of close association? Or has he so severed his relations that his old community is as strange as another? Did he pay taxes in the old community because of his retention of domicile which he could have avoided by giving it up? Were they nominal or substantial? In view of the legislative history showing that Congress was concerned lest there be 'triple taxation'-Federal, State and District-the Board should consider whether taxes similar in character to those laid by this Act have been paid elsewhere. See statement of Representative Bates, quoted supra, p. 6.\n Our mention of these considerations as being relevant must not be taken as an indication of the relative weights to be attached to them, as an implied negation of the relevance of others, or as an effort to suggest a formula to handle all cases that may arise, or the possibility of devising one.\n In view of what we have said, it is clear that the present cases did not call for rulings of non-taxability 'as a matter of law.' On the other hand, we do not consider whether taxability follows as a matter of law, as petitioner contends it does, for the factual inquiries and findings of the Board, made under a view of the law not our own, are quite likely not in all respects those which the Board would have made had it proceeded with knowledge of our opinion, and are in some respects ambiguous for the purpose of decision in accordance with it. Accordingly we reverse the decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and remand these cases to that Court with directions to remand to the Board for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, and Mr. Justice REED, took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 53 Stat. 1087; 20 D.C.Code (Supp. V, 1939)  980a(a). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We do not understand 'permanent' to have been used in a literal sense. Of course it cannot be known without the gift of prophecy whether a given abode is 'permanent' in the strictest sense. But beyond this, it is frequently used in the authorities on domicile to describe that which is not merely 'temporary,' or to describe a dwelling for the time being which there is no presently existing intent to give up. And further, compare a statement by Representative Dirksen on the floor of the House, 84 Cong.Rec. 8973. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Exercise of political rights elsewhere cannot be considered as meant to be conclusive on the issue of taxability in the District.

It makes no difference whether the office is elective or appointive; nor is it material whether the appointment is in its nature merely temporary or has a degree of permanence, though the permanence of the appointment is an element to be considered in determining the domicil.' I Beale, Conflict of Laws  22.6. See also, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, pp. 42, 43. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 1 Beale, Conflict of Laws, p. 172, note 2. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Cf. Williamson v.

David, \n235 \nU.S. 561\n, 35 S.Ct. 164. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This is not inconsistent with our holding that domicile here does not follow from more indefiniteness of the period of one's stay. While the intention to return must be fixed, the date need not be; while the intention to return must be unconditional, the time may be, and in most cases of necessity is, contingent. The intention must not waver before the uncertainties of time, but one may not be visited with unwelcome domicile for lacking the gift of prophecy. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Of course this term does not have the magic qualities of a divining rod in locating domicile. In fact, the search for the domicile of any person capable of acquiring a domicile of choice is but a search for his 'home'.

STATE OF ARKANSAS(1941)\nNo. 43\nArgued: Decided: December 15, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harold R. Ratcliff, of Memphis, Tenn., and Cecil B. Nance, of Marion, Ark., for appellant. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jno. P. Streepey and Leffee Gentry, Asst. Attys. Gen., of Arkansas, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant was convicted and fined by an Arkansas court for transporting intoxicating liquor through the state without a permit as required by an Arkansas statute. The question for decision is whether this statutory requirement and its penal sanction unduly encroach upon the power over interstate commerce delegated to Congress. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 392]\n\u00a0\n The Arkansas Supreme Court sustained the requirement of the permit as a local police regulation permissible under the commerce clause. 201 Ark. 1123, 148 S.W.2d 656. The case comes here on appeal under the provisions of  237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a),  861a, 861b, 28 U. S.C.A.  344(a),  861a, 861b.\n Section 14177, Pope's 1937 Digest of Arkansas Statutes,  5, Act 109 of 1935, under which appellant was convicted, makes it unlawful for any person to ship into the state any distilled spirits without first having obtained a permit from the state commissioner of revenue. The statute provides that the form of permit and the shipments into the state shall be governed by rules and regulations promulgated by the commissioner. Appellant was tried upon a stipulation of facts which tended to show that when arrested in Arkansas he was engaged in transporting by motor truck, without a permit, a load of distilled spirits from a point in Illinois to a point in Mississippi. The state court held that this violated  14177. At the time of the offense there were no regulations specifically applicable to transportation passing through the state, the regulations then in force being adapted to transportation for delivery within the state or from point to point within the state.\n We have no occasion to decide whether the Arkansas statute, when applied to transportation passing through that state for delivery or use in another, derives support from the Twenty-first Amendment, which prohibits the 'transportation or importation' of intoxicating liquors 'into any State ... for delivery or use therein' in violation of its laws, cf. United States v. Gudger, \n249 \nU.S. 373\n, 39 S.Ct. 323. Nor need we decide whether appellant's admission that the transported liquor was intended for importation into Mississippi for illegal use there establishes a violation of the Twenty-first Amendment while he was in Arkansas, so as to deprive him of the right to seek protection of the commerce clause on his journey through Arkansas, cf. McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 85 S., 36 S.Ct. 498, 500, 501. We may also assume that appellant's admission no more deprives him of the right to invoke the protection of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n commerce clause against the Arkansas statute than did intended violation by the importer of the liquor laws of the state of destination defore the adoption of the Webb-Kenyon Act, 37 Stat. 699, 27 U.S.C.A.  122, and the Twenty-first Amendment. See Bowman v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., \n125 \nU.S. 465\n, 8 S.Ct. 689, 1062; Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100\n, 10 S.Ct. 681. For we are of the opinion that upon principles of constitutional interpretation consistently accepted and followed by this Court ever since the decisions in Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 and Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, the commerce clause does not foreclose the Arkansas regulation with which we are now concerned.\n The commerce here is transportation alone, there being no question of sale or use within the state of regulation. We may therefore put to one side the cases in which local restrictions or prohibitions on sale or use of intoxicating liquor or other articles of commerce, unaided by Acts of Congress, have been deemed a prohibited burden on interstate commerce, see Bowman v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., supra; Leisy v. Hardin, supra. The present scheme of regulation is narrower in operation and has a less restrictive effect upon the commerce. It does not forbid the traffic in liquor, nor does it impede it more than is reasonably necessary to inform the local authorities who is to effect the transportation through the state, and to afford opportunity for them to police it.\n The Arkansas Supreme Court in this case has declared that under the statute appellant was entitled to a permit on application, which he does not appear to have made; that the permit requirement is in its nature an inspection measure for which only a nominal fee, necessary to defray the cost of issuing it and of police inspection \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 394]\n\u00a0\n and of necessary reports, is charged. \n1\n It also said that any failure by the state commissioner to act reasonably and promptly in administering the law would be controlled by the courts through mandamus. In a later case, Hardin, Commissioner, v. Spiers, 152 S.W.2d 1010, arising under regulations not in force at the time of appellant's conviction, the same court declared that the commissioner must exercise this power in a reasonable, not an arbitrary manner.\n While the commerce clause has been interpreted as reserving to Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce in matters of national importance, that has never been deemed to exclude the states from regulating matters primarily of local concern with respect to which Congress has not exercised its power, even though the regulation has some effect on interstate commerce. As we had occasion to point out at the last term of Court, there are many matters which are appropriate subjects of regulation in the interest of the safety, health and well-being of local communities which, because of their local character and their number and diversity and because of the practical difficulties involved, may never be adequately dealt with by Congress. Because of their local character also there is wide scope for local regulation without impairing the uniformity of control over the commerce in matters of national concern and without materially obstructing the free flow of commerce, which were the principal objects sought to be secured by the commerce Such regulations, in the absence of supervening Congressional action, have for the most part been sustained by this Court, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 395]\n\u00a0\n notwithstanding the commerce clause. See California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109, 113\n, 61 S.Ct. 930, 932, set seq. and cases cited. See also cases collected in Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34, 39\n, 40 S., 47 S.Ct. 267, 269, 270, and in South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 188, Note 5, and 191, 58 S.Ct. 510, 515, 517.\n In the cases referred to the Court has sustained a variety of local regulations designed to safeguard the states from injurious local effects that may attend interstate transportation. Familiar examples are inspection and quarantine laws for the protection of local health and safety, applicable to persons, animals, and merchandise moving in interstate commerce. Again, a state may insure the safe and convenient use of its harbors and navigable waterways by controlling the movement of vessels in interstate and foreign commerce; in the interests of safety it may control the operations of interstate trains and of their employees and appliances.\n Of recent years the Court has sustained state regulations of the size and weight of motor cars moving interstate, designed to insure the safe and economical use of the states' highways. South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra, and cases cited. A state may police 'caravans' of motor vehicles moving over its highways in interstate commerce and charge a compensatory license for for doing it. Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407\n, 56 S.Ct. 756; Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S. Ct. 744. It may, in the interest of public safety and convenience, restrict particular types of motor vehicles moving in interstate commerce to particular areas. Sproles v.

And a state may undertake to insure the fitness and integrity of those negotiating contracts for interstate transportation, by licensing them and requiring a bond to insure their good behavior. California v. Thompson, supra.\n While the subject matter of the present regulation, transportation of liquor, with its attendant dangers to the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n communities through which it passes, differs in many respects from those which we have mentioned, all are alike in their tendency, if unregulated, to affect the public interest adversely in varying ways depending on local conditions. The efforts at effective regulation, state and national, of intoxicating liquor, evidenced by the long course of litigation in this Court, have not left us unaware of the peculiar difficulties of controlling it or of its tendency to get out of legal bounds. The present requirement of a permit is not shown to be more than a meas of establishing the identity of those who are to engage in the transportation, their route and point of destination, and affords opportunity for local officials to take appropriate measures to insure that the liquor is transported without diversion, in conformity to the permit. The permit device is not unlike state requirements of health certificates for animals or certificates of inspection for goods, which have been sustained here both as to transportation into a state, Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 528\n, 32 S.Ct. 715, 723, 724; Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346\n, 53 S.Ct. 611, and through it, Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S.Ct. 92; cf. Morf v. Bingaman, supra. Where the power to regulate commerce for local protection exists, the states may adopt effective measures to accomplish the permitted end. The Arkansas statute does not conflict with any act of Congress. It does not forbid or preclude the transportation, or interfere with the free flow of commerce among the states beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect the local public interest in preventing unlawful distribution or use of liquor within the state. It does not violate the commerce clause. Cf. Ziffrin, Inc., v. Reeves, \n308 \nU.S. 132\n, 60 S.Ct. 163.\n What we have said is restricted to the statute as applied under the regulations in force at the time of petitioner's alleged offense. It will be time enough to deal with abuses of the permit system if and when they arise. Nor have we occasion to consider the state's authority to regulate other \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 397]\n\u00a0\n articles of commerce less susceptible to uses injurious to the communities through which they pass. Cf. Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 332\n, 37 S.Ct. 180, 187, 188, L.R.A.1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845; Ziffrin, Inc., v. Reeves, supra, \n308 \nU.S. 138\n, 60 S.Ct. 166, 167.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring in result.\n I agree that this Court should not relieve Duckworth of his conviction, but I would rest the decision on the constitutional provision applicable only to the transportation of liquor, and refrain from what I regard as an unwise extension of state power over interstate commerce.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Appellant was convicted for transporting a load of intoxicating liquor through Arkansas without permit from that State on the way from Illinois to Mississippi. The owner of the liquor testified, and his testimony was treated as a stipulation of fact, 'that the liquor was intended to be sold in the State of Mississippi in violation of the state laws of Mississippi.'\n The Twenty-first Amendment provides:\n'The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.'\n\n Duckworth now contends that it is our duty to assure him safe conduct as against the action of Arkansas, although his goal is to violate both the laws of Mississippi and the Federal Constitution. He asks us to hold that one provision of the Constitution guarantees him an opportunity to violate another. The law is not that tricky.\n Whether one transporting liquor across Arkansas to a legal destination might not have some claim to federal protection, we do not need to consider. One who assails the constitutionality of a statute must stand on his own \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 398]\n\u00a0\n right to relief. \n1\n Since this appellant had no rightful claim to constitutional protection for his trip, the whole purpose of which was to violate the Constitution which he invokes, we should leave him where we find him, and for this reason I concur in the judgment of this Court affirming the conviction.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n If we yield to an urge to go beyond this rather narrow but adequate ground of decision, we should then consider whether this liquor controversy cannot properly be determined by guidance from the liquor clauses of the Constitution. These clauses of the Twenty-first Amendment create an important distinction between state power over the liquor traffic and state power over commerce in general. The people of the United States knew that liquor is a lawlessness unto itself. They determined that it should be governed by a specific and particular constitutional provision. They did not leave it to the courts to devise special distortions of the general rules as to interstate com- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n merce to curb liquor's 'tendency to get out of legal bounds.' It was their unsatisfactory experience with that method that resulted in giving liquor an exclusive place in constitutional law as a commodity whose transportation is governed by a special constitutional provision.\n Transportation itself presented no special dangers or hazards, but it might be a step in evading and undermining a policy as to use and sale of liquor which the state has a right to prescribe for itself. Regulated transportation of liquor is a necessary incident of regulated consumption and distribution. So the Twenty-first Amendment made the laws as to delivery and use in the state of destination the test of legality of interstate movement. This obviously gives to state law a much greater control over interstate liquor traffic than over commerce in any other commodity.\n If the Twenty-first Amendment is not to be resorted to for the decision of liquor cases, it is on the way to becoming another 'almost forgotten' clause of the Constitution. Compare Edwards v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 160\n, 62 S.Ct. 164, 86 L.Ed. --, decided November 24, 1941. It certainly applies to nothing else. We should decide whether this Arkansas statute is sustainable under the Twenty-first Amendment. Does it authorize a state to exact some assurance that all liquor entering its territory either is imported for lawful delivery under its own laws or will pass through without diversion? The Amendment might bear a construction that would allow a state to prohibit liquor from entering its borders at all unless by responsible carrier under consignment to some lawful destination within or beyond the state. I should not at all object to considering all of the potential evils which the Court's opinion associates with the liquor traffic, and some more that I could supply, to be sufficient reasons for giving a liberal interpretation to the Twenty-first Amendment as to state power over liquor. But the Court brushes aside the liquor provisions of the Twenty-first Amendment. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 400]\n\u00a0\n III.\n The opinion of the Court solves the present case through a construction of the interstate commerce power. It regards this liquor as a legitimate subject of a lawful commerce, and then, because of its special characteristics, approves this admittedly novel permit system and thus expands the power of the state to regulate such lawful commerce beyond anything this Court has yet approved.\n The extent to which state legislation may be allowed to affect the conduct of interstate business in the absence of Congressional action on the subject has long been a vexatious problem. Recently the tendency has been to abandon the earlier limitations and to sustain more freely such state laws on the ground that Congress has power to supersede them with regulation of its own. It is a tempting escape from a difficult question to pass to Congress the responsibility for continued existence of local restraints and obstructions to national commerce. But these restraints are individually too petty, too diversified, and too local to get the attention of a Congress hard pressed with more urgent matters. The practical result is that in default of action by us they will go on suffocating and retarding and Balkanizing American commerce, trade and industry.\n I differ basically with my brethren as to whether the inertia of government shall be on the side of restraint of commerce or on the side of freedom of commerce. The sluggishness of government, the multitude of matters that clamor for attention, and the relative ease with which men are persuaded to postpone troublesome decisions, all make inertia one of the most decisive powers in determining the course of our affairs and frequently gives to the established order of things a longevity and vitality much beyond its merits. Because that is so, I am reluctant to see any new local systems for restraining our national commerce \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 401]\n\u00a0\n get the prestige and power of established institutions. The Court's present opinion and tendency would allow the states to establish the restraints and let commerce struggle for Congressional action to make it free. This trend I am unwilling to further in any event beyond the plain requirements of existing cases.\n If the reaction of this Court against what many of us have regarded as an excessive judicial interference with legislative action is to yield wholesome results, we must be cautious lest we merely rush to other extremes. The excessive use for insufficient reason of a judicially inflated due process clause to strike down states' laws regulating their own internal affairs, such as hours of labor in industry, minimum wage requirements, and standards for working conditions, is one thing. To invoke the interstate commerce clause to keep the many states from fastening their several concepts of local 'well being' onto the national commerce is a wholly different thing.\n Our national free intercourse is never in danger of being suddenly stifled by dramatic and sweeping acts of restraint. That would produce its own antidote. Our danger, as the forefathers well knew, is from the aggregate strangling effect of a multiplicity of individually petty and diverse and local regulations. Each may serve some local purpose worthy enough by itself. Congress may very properly take into consideration local policies and dangers when it exercises its power under the commerce clause. But to let each locality conjure up its own dangers and be the judge of the remedial restraints to be clamped onto interstate trade inevitably retards our national economy and disintegrates our national society. It is the movement and exchange of goods that sustain living standards, both of him who produces and of him who consumes. This vital national interest in free commerce among the states must not be jeopardized. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 390, 402]\n\u00a0\n I do not suppose the skies will fall if the Court does allow Arkansas to rig up this handy device for policing liquor on the ground that it is not forbidden by the commerce clause, but in doing so it adds another to the already too numerous and burdensome state restraints of national commerce and pursues a trend with which I would have no part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The regulations promulgated by the commissioner on February 3, 1941, after appellant's conviction, provided for the payment of a license fee for the permit. It does not appear that there was any prescribed fee at the time of appellant's offense. Moreover, his sole contention is that the commerce clause precludes the state from exacting any form of permit, either with or without a fee, for the interstate transportation of liquor through the state. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for a unanimous Court, laid down the rule as to tax cases equally applicable to this if, indeed, this is not itself something of a tax case. He pointed out that the Court does not consider arguments on constitutional grounds 'unless the party setting up the unconstitutionality of the state law belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given, or the class primarily protected ....'

PEOPLE OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA(1941)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 21, 1941Decided: November 24, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Slaff, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John H. Tolan, of Oakland, Cal., for the Select Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States, appointed pursuant to House Resolution No. 63, April 22, 1940, to investigate Interstate Migration of Destitute Citizens, as amicus curiae by special leave of Court.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 169]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. T. Sweigert, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts of this case are simple and are not disputed. Appellant is a citizen of the United States and a resident of California. In December, 1939, he left his home in Marysville, California, for Spur, Texas, with the intention of bringing back to Marysville, his wife's brother, Frank Duncan, a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 171]\n\u00a0\n When he arrived in Texas, appellant learned that Duncan had last been employed by the Works Progress Administration. Appellant thus became aware of the fact that Duncan was an indigent person and he continued to be aware of it throughout the period involved in this case. The two men agreed that appellant should transport Duncan from Texas to Marysville in appellant's automobile. Accordingly, they left Spur on January 1, 1940, entered California by way of Arizona on January 3, and reached Marysville on January 5. When he left Texas, Duncan had about $20. It had all been spent by the time he reached Marysville. He lived with appellant for about ten days until he obtained financial assistance from the Farm Security Administration. During the ten day interval, he had no employment.\n In Justice Court a complaint was filed against appellant under Section 2615 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of California, St.1937, p. 1406, which provides: 'Every person, firm or corporation, or officer or agent thereof that brings or assists in bringing into the State any indigent person who is not a resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person, is guilty of a misdemeanor.' On demurrer to the complaint, appellant urged that the Section violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution. The demurrer was overruled, the cause was tried, appellant was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment in the county jail, and sentence was suspended.\n On appeal to the Superior Court of Yuba County, the facts as stated above were stipulated. The Superior Court, although regarding as 'close' the question of the validity of the Section, felt 'constrained to uphold the statute as a valid exercise of the police power of the State of California'. Consequently, the conviction was affirmed. No appeal to a higher state court was open to appellant. We noted probable jurisdiction early last \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 172]\n\u00a0\n term, and later ordered reargument (\n313 \nU.S. 545\n, 61 S.Ct. 956) which has been held.\n At the threshold of our inquiry a question arises with respect to the interpretation of Section 2615. On reargument, the Attorney General of California has submitted an exposition of the history of the Section, which reveals that statutes similar, though not identical to it have been in effect in California since 1860, see Cal.Stat. 1860, p. 213; Cal.Stat. 1901, p. 636; Cal.Stat.1933, p. 2005. Neither under these forerunners nor under Section 2615 itself does the term 'indigent person' seem to have been accorded an authoritative interpretation by the California courts. The appellee claims for the Section a very limited scope. It urges that the term 'indigent person' must be taken to include only persons who are presently destitute of property and without resources to obtain the necessities of life, and who have no relatives or friends able and willing to support them. It is conceded, however, that the term is not confined to those who are physically or mentally incapacitated. While the generality of the language of the Section contains no hint of these limitations, we are content to assign to the term this narrow meaning.\n Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution delegates to the Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce. And it is settled beyond question that the transportation of persons is 'commerce', within the meaning of that provision. \n1\n It is nevertheless true that the States are not wholly precluded from exercising their police power in matters of local concern even though they may thereby affect inter- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 173]\n\u00a0\n state commerce. California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109, 113\n, 61 S.Ct. 930, 932. The issue presented in this case, therefore, is whether the prohibition embodied in Section 2615 against the 'bringing' or transportation of indigent persons into California is within the police power of that State. We think that it is not, and hold that it is an unconstitutional barrier to interstate commerce.\n The grave and perplexing social and economic dislocation which this statute reflects is a matter of common knowledge and concern. We are not unmindful of it. We appreciate that the spectacle of large segments of our population constantly on the move has given rise to urgent demands upon the ingenuity of government. Both the brief of the Attorney General of California and that of the Chairman of the Select Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States as amicus curiae have sharpened this appreciation. The State asserts that the huge influx of migrants into California in recent years has resulted in problems of health, morals, and especially finance, the proportions of which are staggering. It is not for us to say that this is not true. We have repeatedly and recently affirmed, and we now reaffirm, that we do not conceive it our function to pass upon 'the wisdom, need, or appropriateness' of the legislative efforts of the States to solve such difficulties. See Olsen v. Nebraska, \n313 \nU.S. 236, 246\n, 61 S.Ct. 862, 865, 133 A.L.R. 1500\n\n\n But this does not mean that there are no boundaries to the permissible area of State legislative activity. There are. And none is more certain than the prohibition against attempts on the part of any single State to isolate itself from difficulties common to all of them by restraining the transportation of persons and property across its borders. It is frequently the case that a State might gain a momentary respite from the pressure of events by the simple expedient of shutting its gates to the outside world. But, in the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo: 'The Constitution was \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 174]\n\u00a0\n framed under the dominion of a political philosophy less parochial in range. It was framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.' Baldwin v. Seelig, \n294 \nU.S. 511, 523\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 500, 101 A.L.R. 55.\n It is difficult to conceive of a statute more squarely in conflict with this theory than the Section challenged here. Its express purpose and inevitable effect is to prohibit the transportation of indigent persons across the California border. The burden upon interstate commerce is intended and immediate; it is the plain and sole function of the statute. Moreover, the indigent non-residents who are the real victims of the statute are deprived of the opportunity to exert political pressure upon the California legislature in order to obtain a change in policy. South Carolina Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 185, note 2, 58 S.Ct. 510, 513. We think this statute must fail under any known test of the validity of State interference with interstate commerce.\n It is urged, however, that the concept which underlies Section 2615 enjoys a firm basis in English and American history. \n2\n This is the notion that each community should care for its own indigent, that relief is solely the responsibility of local government. Of this it must first be said that we are not now called upon to determine anything other than the propriety of an attempt by a State to prohibit the transportation of indigent non-residents into its territory. The nature and extent of its obligation to afford relief to newcomers is not here involved. We do, however, suggest that the theory of the Elizabethan poor laws no longer fits the facts. Recent years, and particularly the past decade, have been marked by a growing recognition that in an industrial society the task of pro- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 175]\n\u00a0\n viding assistance to the needy has ceased to be local in character. The duty to share the burden, if not wholly to assume it, has been recognized not only by State governments, but by the Federal government as well. The changed attitude is reflected in the Social Security laws under which the Federal and State governments cooperate for the care of the aged, the blind and dependent children. U.S.C., Title 42,  301-1307, 42 U.S.C.A.  301-1307, esp.  301, 501, 601, 701, 721, 801, 1201. It is reflected in the works programs under which work is furnished the unemployed, with the States supplying approximately 25% and the Federal government approximately 75% of the cost. See, e.g., Joint Resolution of June 26, 1940, c. 432,  1(d), 76th Cong., 3rd Sess., 54 Stat. 611, 613, 15 U.S.C.A .  721-728. It is further reflected in the Farm Security laws, under which the entire cost of the relief provisions is borne by the Federal government. Id., at  2(a), 2(b), 2(d).\n Indeed the record in this very case illustrates the inadequate basis in fact for the theory that relief is presently a local matter. Before leaving Texas, Duncan had received assistance from the Works Progress Administration. After arriving in California he was aided by the Farm Security Administration, which, as we have said, is wholly financed by the Federal government. This is not to say that our judgment would be different if Duncan had received relief from local agencies in Texas and California. Nor is it to suggest that the financial burden of assistance to indigent persons does not continue to fall heavily upon local and State governments. It is only to illustrate that in not inconsiderable measure the relief of the needy has become the common responsibility and concern of the whole nation.\n What has been said with respect to financing relief is not without its bearing upon the regulation of the transportation of indigent persons. For the social phenomenon of large-scale interstate migration is as certainly a matter of national concern as the provision of assistance to those who have found a permanent or temporary abode. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 176]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, and unlike the relief problem, this phenomenon does not admit of diverse treatment by the several States. The prohibition against transporting indigent non-residents into one State is an open invitation to retaliatory measures, and the burdens upon the transportation of such persons become cumulative. Moreover, it would be a virtual impossibility for migrants and those who transport them to acquaint themselves with the peculiar rules of admission of many states. 'This court has repeatedly declared that the grant (the commerce clause) established the immunity of interstate commerce from the control of the states respecting all those subjects embraced within the grant which are of such a nature as to demand that, if regulated at all, their regulation must be prescribed by a single authority.' Milk Control Board v. Eisenberg Farm Products, \n306 \nU.S. 346, 351\n, 59 S.Ct. 528, 530. We are of the opinion that the transportation of indigent persons from State to State clearly falls within this class of subjects. The scope of Congressional power to deal with this problem we are not now called upon to decide.\n There remains to be noticed only the contention that the limitation upon State power to interfere with the interstate transportation of persons is subject to an exception in the case of 'paupers'. It is true that support for this contention may be found in early decisions of this Court. In City of New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 102, 103, at page 143, it was said that it is 'as competent and as necessary for a state to provide precautionary measures against the moral pestilence of paupers, vagabonds, and possibly convicts; as it is to guard against the physical pestilence, which may arise from unsound and infectious articles imported ....' This language has been casually repeated in numerous later cases up to the turn of the century. See, e.g., Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 426 and 466, 467; Hannibal & St. J. Railway Company v. Husen, \n95 \nU.S. 465\n, 471; Plumley v. Massachusetts, \n155 \nU.S. 461, 478\n, 15 S.Ct. 154, 160; Missouri, Kansas & Topeka Ry. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 177]\n\u00a0\n v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 629\n, 18 S.Ct. 488, 494. In none of these cases, however, was the power of a State to exclude 'paupers' actually involved.\n Whether an able-bodied but unemployed person like Duncan is a 'pauper' within the historical meaning of the term is open to considerable doubt. See 53 Harvard L.Rev. 1031, 1032. But assuming that the term is applicable to him and to persons similarly situated, we do not consider ourselves bound by the language referred to. City of New York v. Miln was decided in 1836. Whatever may have been the notion then prevailing, we do not think that it will now be seriously contended that because a person is without employment and without funds he constitutes a 'moral pestilence'. Poverty and immorality are not synonymous.\n We are of the opinion that Section 2615 is not a valid exercise of the police power of California, that it imposes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce, and that the conviction under it cannot be sustained. In the view we have taken it is unnecessary to decide whether the Section is repugnant to other provisions of the Constitution.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.\n I express no view on whether or not the statute here in question runs afoul of Art. I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution granting to Congress the power 'to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.' But I am of the opinion that the right of persons to move freely from State to State occupies a more protected position in our constitutional system than does the movement of cattle, fruit, steel and coal across state lines. While the opinion of the Court expresses no view on that issue, the right involved is so fundamental that I deem it appropriate to indicate the reach of the constitutional question which is present. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 178]\n\u00a0\n The right to move freely from State to State is an incident of national citizenship protected by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against state interference. Mr. Justice Moody in Twining v. State of New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n, 29 S.Ct. 14, 18, stated, 'Privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States ... are only such as arise out of the nature and essential character of the national government, or are specifically granted or secured to all citizens or persons by the Constitution of the United States.' And he went on to state that one of those rights of national citizenship was 'the right to pass freely from state to state'. Id., 211 U.S. page 97, 29 S.Ct. pages 18, 19. Now it is apparent that this right is not specifically granted by the Constitution. Yet before the Fourteenth Amendment it was recognized as a right fundamental to the national character of our Federal government. It was so decided in 1867 by Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 39. In that case this Court struck down a Nevada tax 'upon every person leaving the State' by common carrier. Mr. Justice Miller writing for the Court held that the right to move freely throughout the nation was a right of national citizenship. That the right was implied did not make it any the less 'guaranteed' by the Constitution. Id., 6 Wall. page 47. To be sure, he emphasized that the Nevada statute would obstruct the right of a citizen to travel to the seat of his national government or its offices throughout the country. And see United States v. Wheeler, \n254 \nU.S. 281, 299\n, 41 S.Ct. 133, 136. But there is not a shred of evidence in the record of the Crandall case that the persons there involved were en route on any such mission any more than it appears in this case that Duncan entered California to interview some federal agency. The point which Mr. Justice Miller made was merely in illustration of the damage and havoc which would ensue if the States had the power to prevent the free movement of citizens from one State to another. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 179]\n\u00a0\n This is emphasized by his quotation from Chief Justice Taney's dissenting opinion in the Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492: 'We are all citizens of the United States, and as members of the same community must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.' Hence the dictum in United States v. Wheeler, supra, 254 U.S. page 299, 41 S.Ct. page 136, which attempts to limit the Crandall case to a holding that the statute in question directly burdened 'the performance by the United States of its governmental functions' and limited the 'rights of the citizens growing out of such functions,' does not bear analysis.\n So, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868 it had been squarely and authoritatively settled that the right to move freely from State to State was a right of national citizenship. As such it was protected by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against state interference. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 74, 79. In the latter case Mr. Justice Miller recognized that it was so 'protected by implied guarantees' of the Constitution. Id., 16 Wall. page 79. That was also acknowledged in Twining v. State of New Jersey, supra. And Chief Justice Fuller in Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 21 S.Ct. 128, 129, stated: 'Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to remove from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any state is a right secured by the 14th Amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution.'\n In the face of this history I cannot accede to the suggestion (Helson v. Com. of Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 49 S.Ct. 279, 281; Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404, 444\n, 56 S.Ct. 252, 265, 102 A.L.R. 54) that the commerce clause is the appropriate explanation of Crandall v. Nevada, supra. Two of the Justices in that case expressly \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 180]\n\u00a0\n put the decision on the commerce clause; the others put it on the broader ground of rights of national citizenship, Mr. Justice Miller stating that 'we do not concede that the question before us is to be determined' by the commerce clause. Id., 6 Wall. page 43. On that broader ground it should continue to rest.\n To be sure, there are expressions in the cases that this right of free movement of persons is an incident of state citizenship protected against discriminatory state action by Art. IV, Sec. 2 of the Constitution. Corfield v. Coryell, Fed.Cas.No.3,230, 4 Wash. C.C. 371, 381; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall, 168, 180; Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430; United States v. Wheeler, supra, 254 U.S. pages 298, 299, 41 S.Ct. pages 135, 136. Under the dicta of those cases the statute in the instant case would not survive, since California is curtailing only the free movement of indigents who are non-residents of that State. But the thrust of the Crandall case is deeper. Mr. Justice Miller adverted to Corfield v. Coryell, Paul v. Virginia, and Ward v. Maryland, when he stated in the Slaughter-House Cases that the right protected by the Crandall case was a right of national citizenship arising from the 'implied guarantees' of the Constitution. 16 Wall. at pages 75-79. But his failure to classify that right as one of state citizenship protected solely by Art. IV, sec. 2, underscores his view that the free movement of persons throughout this nation was a right of national citizenship. It likewise emphasizes that Art. IV, Sec. 2, whatever its reach, is primarily concerned with the incidents of residence ( the matter involved in United States v. Wheeler, supra) and the exercise of rights within a State, so that a citizen of one State is not in a 'condition of alienage when he is within or when he removes to another state.' Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 256\n, 19 S.Ct. 165, 172. Furthermore, Art. IV, Sec. 2, cannot explain the Crandall decision. The statute in that case applied to citizens of Nevada as well as to citizens of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 181]\n\u00a0\n other States. That is to say Nevada was not 'discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of its own.' Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, \n307 \nU.S. 496, 511\n, 59 S.Ct. 954, 962, and cases cited. Thus it is plain that the right of free ingress and egress rises to a higher constitutional dignity than that afforded by state citizenship.\n The conclusion that the right of free movement is a right of national citizenship stands on firm historical ground. If a state tax on that movement, as in the Crandall case, is invalid, a fortiori a state statute which obstructs or in substance prevents that movement must fall. That result necessarily follows unless perchance a State can curtail the right of free movement of those who are poor or destitute. But to allow such an exception to be engrafted on the rights of national citizenship would be to contravene every conception of national unity. It would also introduce a caste system utterly incompatible with the spirit of our system of government. It would permit those who were stigmatized by a State as indigents, paupers, or vagabonds to be relegated to an inferior class of citizenship. It would prevent a citizen because he was poor from seeking new horizons in other States. It might thus withhold from large segments of our people that mobility which is basic to any guarantee of freedom of opportunity. The result would be a substantial dilution of the rights of national citizenship, a serious impairment of the principles of equality. Since the state statute here challenged involves such consequences, it runs afoul of the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n I concur in the result reached by the Court, and I agree that the grounds of its decision are permissible ones under \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 182]\n\u00a0\n applicable authorities. But the migrations of a human being, of whom it is charged that he possesses nothing that can be sold and has no wherewithal to buy, do not fit easily into my notions as to what is commerce. To hold that the measure of his rights is the commerce clause is likely to result eventually either in distorting the commercial law or in denaturing human rights. I turn, therefore, away from principles by which commerce is regulated to that clause of the Constitution by virtue of which Duncan is a citizen of the United States and which forbids any state to abridge his privileges or immunities as such.\n This clause was adopted to make United States citizenship the dominant and paramount allegiance among us. The return which the law had long associated with allegiance was protection. The power of citizenship as a shield against oppression was widely known from the example of Paul's Roman citizenship, which sent the centurion scurrying to his higher-ups with the message: 'Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.' I suppose none of us doubts that the hope of imparting to American citizenship some of this vitality was the purpose of declaring in the Fourteenth Amendment: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ....'\n But the hope proclaimed in such generality soon shriveled in the process of judicial interpretation. For nearly three-quarters of a century this Court rejected every plea to the privileges and immunities clause. The judicial history of this clause and the very real difficulties in the way of its practical application to specific cases have been too well and recently reviewed to warrant repetition. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 183]\n\u00a0\n While instances of valid 'privileges or immunities' must be but few, I am convinced that this is one. I do not ignore or belittle the difficulties of what has been characterized by this Court as an 'almost forgotten' clause. But the difficulty of the task does not excuse us from giving these general and abstract words whatever of specific content and concreteness they will bear as we mark out their application, case by case. That is the method of the common law, and it has been the method of this Court with other no less general statements in our fundamental law. This Court has not been timorous about giving concrete meaning to such obscure and vagrant phrases as 'due process,' 'general welfare,' 'equal protection,' or even 'commerce among the several States.' But it has always hesitated to give any real meaning to the privileges and immunities clause lest it improvidently give too much.\n This Court should, however, hold squarely that it is a privilege of citizenship of the United States, protected from state abridgment, to enter any state of the Union, either for temporary sojourn or for the establishment of permanent residence therein and for gaining resultant citizenship thereof. If national citizenship means less than this, it means nothing.\n The language of the Fourteenth Amendment declaring two kinds of citizenship is discriminating. It is: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' While it thus establishes national citizenship from the mere circumstance of birth within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, birth within a state does not establish citizenship thereof. State citizenship is ephemeral. It results only from residence and is gained or lost therewith. That choice of residence was subject to local approval is contrary to the inescapable implications of the westward movement of our civilization. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 184]\n\u00a0\n Even as to an alien who had 'been admitted to the United States under the Federal law,' this Court, through Mr. Justice Hughes, declared that 'He was thus admitted with the privilege of entering and abiding in the United States, and hence of entering and abiding in any state in the Union.' Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 36 S.Ct. 7, 9, L.R.A.1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.1917B, 283. Why we should hesitate to hold that federal citizenship implies rights to enter and abide in any state of the Union at least equal to those possessed by aliens passes my understanding. The world is even more upside down than I had supposed it to be, if California must accept aliens in deference to their federal privileges but is free to turn back citizens of the United States unless we treat them as subjects of commerce.\n The right of the citizen to migrate from state to state which, I agree with Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, is shown by our precedents to be one of national citizenship, is not, however, an unlimited one. In addition to being subject to all constitutional limitations imposed by the federal government, such citizen is subject to some control by state governments. He may not, if a fugitive from justice, claim freedom to migrate unmolested, nor may he endanger others by carrying contagion about. These causes, and perhaps others that do not occur to me now, warrant any public authority in stopping a man where it finds him and arresting his progress across a state line quite as much as from place to place within the state.\n It is here that we meet the real crux of this case. Does 'indigence' as defined by the application of the California statute constitute a basis for restricting the freedom of a citizen, as crime or contagion warrants its restriction' We should say now, and in no uncertain terms, that a man's mere property status, without more, cannot be used by a state to test, qualify, or limit his rights as a citizen of the United States. 'Indigence' in itself is neither a source of rights nor a basis for denying them. The mere \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 185]\n\u00a0\n state of being without funds is a neutral fact-constitutionally an irrelevance, like race, creed, or color. I agree with what I understand to be the holding of the Court that cases which may indicate the contrary are overruled.\n Any measure which would divide our citizenry on the basis of property into one class free to move from state to state and another class that is poverty-bound to the place where it has suffered misfortune is not only at war with the habit and custom by which our country has expanded, but is also a short-sighted blow at the security of property itself. Property can have no more dangerous, even if unwitting, enemy than one who would make its possession a pretext for unequal or exclusive civil rights. Where those rights are derived from national citizenship no state may impose such a test, and whether the Congress could do so we are not called upon to inquire.\n I think California had no right to make the condition of Duncan's purse, with no evidence of violation by him of any law or social policy which caused it, the basis of excluding him or of punishing one who extended him aid.\n If I doubted whether his federal citizenship alone were enough to open the gates of California to Duncan, my doubt would disappear on consideration of the obligations of such citizenship. Duncan owes a duty to render military service, and this Court has said that this duty is the result of his citizenship. Mr. Chief Justice White declared in the Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 \nU.S. 366, 378\n, 38 S.Ct. 159, 161, L.R.A.1918C, 361, Ann.Cas.1918B, 856: 'It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel it.' A contention that a citizen's duty to render military service is suspended by 'indigence' would meet with little favor. Rich or penniless, Duncan's citizenship under the Con- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 160, 186]\n\u00a0\n stitution pledges his strength to the defense of California as a part of the United States, and his right to migrate to any part of the land he must defend is something she must respect under the same instrument. Unless this Court is willing to say that citizenship of the United States means at least this much to the citizen, then our heritage of constitutional privileges and immunities is only a promise to the ear to be broken to the hope, a teasing illusion like a munificent bequest in a pauper's will. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Gloucester Ferry Co. v.

Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here upon affirmance by the Circuit Court of Appeals of a sentence imposed after a plea of nolo contendere. \n1\n We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 632\n, 61 S.Ct. 51, 85 L.Ed. --, because there were involved certain important questions of criminal procedure, especially with respect to a plea in bar filed by petitioner. That plea claimed immunity from prosecution because of prior incriminating testimony given under compulsion by the petitioner at an investigation conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n The indictment against petitioner, in eleven counts, arose out of an alleged fraudulent scheme for selling in- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n terests, created by him as a part of the device, in various oil and gas leases in Oklahoma and Texas. The first three counts charged violations of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.  77q(a), 15 U.S.C.A .  77q(a); the fourth and fifth, violations of the registration provisions of that Act, 15 U.S.C.  77e, 15 U.S.C.A.  77e; counts six to ten, violations of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.  338, 18 U.S.C.A.  338; and the eleventh count, a conspiracy to commit the offenses previously set forth.\n On December 16, 1938, petitioner filed a demurrer, attacking the legal sufficiency of the indictment on a number of grounds. At the same time he filed a 'Plea in Bar and Application for Production of Transcript of Evidence.' The substance of this plea was the following: That on April 14, 1938, and two successive dates, pursuant to subpoenas duces tecum, petitioner had appeared before an officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission with the books and records called for, and 'after having claimed his immunity against self incrimination, as provided by law and the Constitution of the United States, under compulsion, testified under oath, pursuant to various questions propounded and asked him by said officer of said Commission, said testimony concerning said defendant's identity and relationship to various trusts and organizations which are the subject matter of this prosecution and concerning divers and sundry other matters pertaining to the matters which are the subject of this prosecution, and particularly to the personal entries, books and records of said defendant, which are a part of the subject matter of this prosecution.' The pleading goes on to state, upon information and belief, that the evidence adduced by the Commission in the course of its investigation was transmitted to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution; that petitioner was compelled to give information and testimony 'which \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n it is believed the Government will use against him in the prosecution herein'; and that petitioner was accordingly immune from prosecution under Section 22(c) of the Securities Act. \n2\n Petitioner further set forth that at the time of the Commission hearings he had demanded a copy of the transcript of his testimony, offering to pay the cost thereof, but that the request had been refused; that on December 1, 1938, he had made a similar request, which also had been refused, as evidenced by an attached letter from the assistant general counsel of the Commission. \n3\n Petitioner renewed his demand and tender of payment, asserting that it was necessary for him to have the transcript in the presentation to the court of his plea in bar, and that it was necessary for the court to have it before passing on the plea. The pleading concludes by pray- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 477]\n\u00a0\n ing the court to order that the transcript be furnished petitioner and that he be heard on the merits of this plea in bar.\n On February 28, 1939, the Government filed a pleading called a 'Motion to Strike Plea in Bar and Objection to Production of Transcript of Evidence.' This attacked the sufficiency of the plea in bar on its face in three different respects, and also alleged in the nature of an answer that petitioner 'was never sworn at any time during the proceedings or hearings complained of and at no time produced any books or records, and did not at any time testify under oath, and was never compelled to testify or give any information against himself of anyone else under oath or otherwise and that each of said hearings complained of was recessed shortly after the defendant interposed his plea of immunity.' In support of this last allegation the Government attached an affidavit of an attorney of the Securities and Exchange Commission who had been present on all three occasions when the petitioner claimed to have given incriminating testimony under compulsion.\n Petitioner moved to strike this affidavit of the Commission attorney on the ground that it deprived him of his right to cross-examination and that it was 'wholly incompetent to establish the facts attempting to be established.'\n The District Court overruled petitioner's demurrer to the indictment, his plea in bar and application for the transcript, and also his motion to strike the affidavit of the Commission attorney. An affidavit later filed by the Government in the Circuit Court of Appeals shows that at this hearing on petitioner's plea in bar 'counsel for the government of the United States stated to the Court that they had the transcripts of the record \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 478]\n\u00a0\n in the proceedings ... and if the government's affidavit was not sufficient, the government would offer them in evidence if the Court desired to examine them; that upon being so advised, His Honor, Judge Vaught, stated that he did not care to see the transcripts, that he did not need them to pass upon the said plea in bar, and that he was going to overrule the defendant's plea in bar.' The Government's motion to strike the plea in bar was overruled, also. Subsequently petitioner withdrew his original plea of not guilty,4 and entered a plea of nolo contendere. The District Court sentenced him to three years on each count, the terms to run concurrently. On appeal petitioner assigned as error the action of the District Court in overruling his demurrer and plea.\n When the case was argued before the Circuit Court of Appeals the Government submitted, over petitioner's objection, a copy of what it said was a transcript of petitioner's testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission, supported by an affidavit of the assistant United States attorney in charge of this prosecution. The transcript was offered to buttress the Government's contention that petitioner had in fact given no testimony of an incriminating nature, but the Circuit Court of Appeals did not rest its affirmance even in part upon the contents of the transcript.\n The court affirmed because the plea in bar did not allege that the claim of immunity was made in a 'hearing' of the Commission as distinguished from an 'investigation' and because no evidence was produced by petitioner in support of his plea. As to the demurrer to the indictment, the Circuit Court of Appeals found no error in omitting from the conspiracy count allegations that the classes of securities involved in the alleged frauds were not in the excepted categories of securities \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n in section three of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  77c. This was the sole ground of petitioner's attack on the conspiracy count. In the belief that a sentence on this count, to run concurrently with equal sentences on the other counts, made it unnecessary to examine the other counts,5 the court did not examine the sufficiency of the other counts.\n Petitioner urges as grounds for our reversal of the judgment below the errors in overruling his plea in bar and demurrer, in affirming a sentence of three years on the conspiracy count of the indictment without examination of the other counts, and in receiving the transcript of testimony before the Commission and accompanying affidavit as evidence.\n Plea in Bar. The Government challenges the sufficiency of the plea in bar to show petitioner's claim to the benefit of the amnesty of Section 22( c). It suggests that the excerpt set out in the third paragraph of this opinion shows only that testimony was given concerning 'defendant's identity and relationship' to the organizations whose securities the indictment charges defendant fraudulently sold; that 'other matters' testified to are not specified nor the 'nature' of the testimony concerning them or his personal records. But the allegations of the plea are not to be weighed separately. Petitioner's identity and his relationship to the trusts alleged to have been created by him as a part of the fraudulent scheme are of primary importance in the proof of his criminality. This is quite different from the testimony in Heike v. United States,6 a prosecution for fraud on the revenue in weighing imported sugar. There former testimony in a Sherman Act proceeding related to official connection with a company involved and also a table showing the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n amount of sugar handled by the company, and a claim for amnesty was denied because the evidence 'neither led nor could have led to a discovery of his crime.' Certainly had petitioner given evidence of his creation of the organizations which the indictment says were part of his artifice it might easily have led to discovery of his trickery. It seems, too, that at least some of the other matters were specified, to wit: the personal entries, books and records of petitioner. Likewise the nature of his alleged testimony concerning his records is sufficiently related to the indictment by saying they are a part of the subject matter of this prosecution. The plea is good on its face.\n It is next urged that the plea was properly overruled because of petitioner's failure to prove its allegations. \n7\n Such result is assumed to follow on the theory that as the burden was on petitioner to prove his plea, the failure of the record to show an offer of proof justifies the order. As appears from the preceding statement of the case, the trial court overruled not only the plea in bar but petitioner's motion for production of the transcript, which was certainly the best evidence of whether the testimony before the Commission was sufficiently related to the prosecution to support amnesty. In the Martin case,8 this Court said the action dismissing a traversed motion for failure of proof would have been reversed if the opportunity to establish the facts by evidence had been denied the accused. Treating the Government's motion to strike the plea in bar as a traverse of that pleading which would justify the order overruling it in the absence of a showing in the record of an offer of proof, that result does not follow where, as here, the plea \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 481]\n\u00a0\n is accompanied by a motion for the production of the transcript of the former evidence. The plea and motion showed that application had previously been made to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the transcript and had been refused.\n We assume that the proceeding in which the former testimony was given was a private and confidential investigation of the Commission rather than a hearing which might eventuate in an order. \n9\n The Commission's refusal to produce the record indicates that the request had been for a complete transcript of the hearing. It rests in the discretion of the trial court to issue an order to show cause why the complete transcript should not be produced, if it deems all of it necessary, or only so much as may fairly make it appear whether the testimony of petitioner before the Commission was a proper foundation for the amnesty claimed. This is not an instance of the inspection of notes or material gathered by a prosecutor for his own use. \n10\n What is sought is the production as evidence in the hearing on the plea in bar of the very foundation of the plea. We find nothing in this record to indicate the desirability of secrecy so far as the testimony of petitioner is concerned. The Government introduced in the Court of Appeals a purported transcript of petitioner's former testimony without asserting its confidential character then or in the motion and traverse below.\n Finally the Government contends that the refusal to order the production of the testimony was not prejudicial. This argument presupposes that the offer to produce in the trial court and the actual production in the Circuit Court of Appeals was adequate. Otherwise we cannot \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 482]\n\u00a0\n know what the testimony was which is relied upon for the amnesty. We think that neither offer was an adequate proffer. In neither instance was the petitioner given an opportunity to cross-examine; no witness produced the transcript; it was not certified as a part of the record from the trial court or as a part of the records of the agency. \n11\n The record certified to the Circuit Court of Appeals is the record on which the appeal is to be heard. Criminal Appeals Rules VIII and IX, 18 U.S.C.A.  688.\n The refusal to permit the accused to prove his defense may prove trivial when the facts are developed. Procedural errors often are. But procedure is the skeleton which forms and supports the whole structure of a case. The lack of a bone mars the symmetry of the body. The parties must be given an opportunity to plead and prove their contentions or else the impression of the judge arising from sources outside the record dominates results. The requirement that allegations must be supported by evidence tested by cross-examination protects against falsehood. The opportunity to assert rights through pleading and testimony is essential to their successful protection. Infringement of that opportunity is forbidden. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Other objections. As the case must be remanded, petitioner's objection to the three-year sentence on the conspiracy count is sustained without discussion. Criminal Code, section 37, 18 U.S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A .  88. Frivolous objection is made to the indictment because it is endorsed 'A true bill, Ernest W. Clarke, Foreman' instead of Foreman of the grand jury. This contention is rejected.\n Petitioner brings here for review his demurrer to the indictment and each count thereof. The Circuit Court of Appeals found the conspiracy count sufficient against \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 483]\n\u00a0\n an attack that in charging a conspiracy to violate the Securities Act of 1933 by selling unregistered securities, the count failed to charge that the securities so sold were not of the class exempted from registration under section three of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. With this ruling we agree. \n13\n As the sentence under count eleven, the conspiracy count, was for as long a time as any of the other counts upon which concurrent sentences had been imposed, the Circuit Court of Appeals did not review the alleged deficiencies of the other counts.\n Counts four and five are charged with the same fault as eleven. For a like reason we hold them good. Counts one and two describe the scheme to defraud and allege instances of the use of the mails. The brief of petitioner fails to raise any question deserving consideration as to their sufficiency and we see none. Petitioner challenges count three for failure to state the materiality of facts which the count charges were omitted, although they were required to be stated to avoid misleading purchasers. \n14\n But the count after describing various omitted facts by paragraphs, ends such paragraphs with the allegation 'such fact being well known to said defendants and each of them at all times herein mentioned, and such fact being material in order to make the statements made by said defendants, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading ....' The facts alleged were obviously material. Counts six to ten inclusive are based upon the mail fraud statute. \n15\n Petitioner's objection to these counts is that a later act, the Securities Act of 1933, makes it unlawful to use the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 473, 484]\n\u00a0\n mails to defraud by the sale of securities. His argument is that in so far as the later act prohibits the fraudulent sale of securities by mail, it repeals by implication the provisions of the old mail fraud statute in so far as they cover securities. We see no basis for a conclusion that Congress intended to repeal the earlier statute.

Gamble and Alden B. Howland, both of Des Moines, Iowa, for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward R. Johnston, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this suit in the District Court for Northern Illinois to recover damages suffered by reason of alleged fraudulent statements made by respondent's agents which induced petitioner to purchase of respondent a large number of Longview (Washington) local improvement bonds. The trial to a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for petitioner in the sum of $66,150. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed on the ground that some of the untrue statements, on the faith of which petitioner had purchased the bonds, were within the protection of the 'hedge clause' which appeared in a circular by which respondent had offered the bonds for sale to petitioner. The clause read:\n'All statements herein are official or are based on information which we regard as reliable, and while we do \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 412]\n\u00a0\n not guarantee them, we ourselves have relied upon them in the purchase of this security.' (112 F.2d 302, 305.)\n\n The court found that another untrue statement contained in a letter written by respondent's agent to petitioner was 'carelessly made', but, taken alone, was too trivial in its effect in inducing petitioner to purchase the bonds, to support the verdict. It also held that there was no breach of legal duty on the part of respondent or its officers in their failure to reveal to petitioner facts known to respondent indicating that a financial statement of a guarantor of the bonds, submitted to petitioner by respondent's agent, on the faith of which petitioner had bought the bonds, did not truly represent the financial condition of the guarantor. We granted certiorari October 14, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 626\n, 61 S.Ct. 40, 85 L.Ed . --, upon a petition which asserted the failure of the court below to follow state law in its rulings, the questions presented being of public importance because they involve the relation of the federal courts to the states.\n We summarize briefly the evidence submitted to the jury which bears on the contentions made before us. Respondent is a large dealer in bonds and securities, with an office in Chicago. Petitioner is an Iowa corporation having its office and principal place of business in Iowa where the transactions resulting in the sale of the bonds in question took place. In May, 1930, respondent through an agent offered to sell petitioner a quantity of the bonds of the Longview local improvement districts. The offering was by printed circular issued by respondent on April 7, 1927, which described the bonds as payable from proceeds of special assessments to be levied upon the benefited properties and stated that their payment was guaranteed principal and interest by Long-Bell Lumber Company, whose balance sheet for the year ending December 31, 1926, was printed in the circular. The circular stated \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 413]\n\u00a0\n 'LONGVIEW IS SITUATED ABOUT 133 MILES SOUth Of seattle at the confluence of the Columbia and Cowlitz Rivers. It has a frontage of 7 1\/4 miles on the former, and is a port of call for ocean-going vessels midway between Portland and the Pacific Ocean. ... Because of its natural advantages and proximity to the timber stands of the Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser interests, Longview was selected as the site for the vast lumber manufacturing plants of these companies. The present output of the Long- Bell plants is 1,800,000 board feet per day. The Weyerhaeuser plants are under construction. Manufacturing plants have also been erected by other concerns, including the Longview Concrete Pipe Company, the Pacific Straw Paper & Board Company, the Magor Car Corporation, the Standard Oil Company, Longview Paint & Varnish Company, and the Central Mill Works. The first unit of the plants of the Longview Fibre Company, to cost 2 1\/2 million dollars, is now well under way.'\n The circular contained the 'hedge clause' which has already been quoted.\n In making the offering, respondent's agent also informed a vice president of petitioner that the bonds were secured by assessments on properties in the City of Longview and as additional security carried the full and complete guarantee of the Long-Bell Lumber Company which was a very large, long established company doing business in the south and west, and that local improvement districts Nos. 11 and 19, against which most of the bonds were issued, were practically co-extensive with the limits of the city.\n After reading the circular petitioner's view president requested of respondent's agent additional information about Longview and the property there and about the Long-Bell Lumber Company, which he supplied in a number of documents. One was a booklet issued by the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n Longview Company, a subsidiary of Long-Bell Lumber Company, engaged in selling Longview real estate. The booklet showed a map on which the mills of Longview Lumber Company, the property of the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company and the City of Longview appeared to extend to and along the northerly side of the Columbia River. The map bore a legend reciting that it 'is intended to show in a general way the relation of the various parts of the city in relation to water, railroad and highway transportation facilities'. Another document was advance proof of an advertisement of the Longview Company, published in the Saturday Evening Post. It contained an illustration of extensive manufacturing plants, beneath which it was stated 'The thoroughly modern electrically operated manufacturing plants shown in the above sketch are in Longview, Wn. They produce 1,800,000 feet of Douglas lumber a day. The buildings cover 72 acres. Six ocean-going freighters can load at one time at the Long-Bell docks'. Another document was a booklet issued by the Longview Chamber of Commerce containing statements from which it could reasonably be inferred that the manufacturing plants of the Long-Bell Lumber Company and the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company were within the City of Longview and that the latter was on the Longview waterfront along the Columbia River.\n Still another document, which will presently be discussed, was the published balance sheet for the year ending December 31, 1929, of the Long- Bell Lumber Company. Respondent's sales manager, on May 15, 1930, also wrote to petitioner's vice president a letter offering the first $100,000 of bonds purchased by petitioner saying, 'We believe you have before you practically all the data covering this issue of bonds' and, 'you observe, of course, that this city has no funded debt other than these \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n improvement bonds and that the original debt has been materially reduced through retirement and maturity.'\n It is not seriously contended here that petitioner did not purchase the bonds on the faith of the statements which we have detailed and others of similar character, nor is it denied that the Long-Bell, Weyerhaeuser, Longview Fibre and Standard Oil Company plants were all outside the city limits of Longview and that none of those properties were subject to assessments in any of the improvement districts. The mill properties were located between the Columbia River and the limits of the City of Longview. The city never had a frontage of 7 1\/4 miles upon the Columbia River and no such frontage at all except for a distance of about 200 yards adjacent to the Longview dock and not within the improvement districts. Substantially all of the land included within the local improvement districts of Longview was also included within a diking district known as Cowlitz County Consolidated Diking District No. 1, which in May, 1930, when the negotiations for the sale of the bonds to petitioner took place, had outstanding bonds in the sum of $2,554,000 payable from the proceeds of special assessments to be levied upon substantially all lands within the improvement districts. Respondent had purchased the entire issue of diking bonds from the Long-Bell Lumber Company in 1925 and later resold them to the public.\n At the trial a vice president of respondent, called by petitioner as an adverse witness, testified that in purchasing the local improvement district bonds respondent gave no consideration to the special assessments against Longview real estate; that respondent regarded Long-Bell Lumber Company's guarantee as the sole justification for handling the bonds and would not have handled them without the guarantee. None of these facts detailed by the witness were communicated to petitioner in advance of the sale of the bonds. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 416]\n\u00a0\n A close business relationship had existed between respondent and Long- Bell Lumber Company for some years before 1930. It had purchased from the Lumber Company and sold to customers $25,000,000 of its first mortgage bonds between 1922 and 1926, and in some of its offerings it had been referred to as the 'fiscal agent' of the Long-Bell Lumber Company. In 1926 it had purchased from the Lumber Company and resold $3,250,000 of its bonds. In the years 1925, 1926, and 1927 it purchased from the Lumber Company and later resold more than $3,000,000 of the Longview local improvement district bonds.\n The Long-Bell Lumber Company balance-sheet for 1929, to which we have referred, disclosed total assets of more than $116,000,000 with current assets of cash and inventories amounting to more than $15,000,000. Current liabilities were less than $8,000,000 including bank loans of $4,000,000. The funded debt of Long-Bell and all subsidiaries was less than $42,000, 000, and capital and surplus were shown in excess of $59,000,000.\n There was much evidence from which the jury could have found that the Lumber Company, prior to the first sale of the bonds to petitioner in May, 1930, had, by more or less regular reports, kept respondent closely advised of developments at Longview and generally of its financial condition. Among the data transmitted were documents produced from respondent's files showing that in 1927 sales of Longview real estate by the Lumber Company's real estate subsidiary had practically ceased; that during 1928 properties already sold were being taken back on the forfeiture of installment sales contracts, and that in April and May of that year forfeitures and repurchases in number and valuation of properties equalled new sales; that in 1928 respondent conducted market operations in the securities of the Lumber Company and asked $75,000 as compensation \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 417]\n\u00a0\n for bringing about an improvement in their market quotations.\n During the early months of 1930 and before the first sale of bonds to petitioner, which occurred on May 17th, there were frequent communications of information from the Long-Bell Lumber Company to respondent from which the jury could have found that respondent was advised of the progressive financial deterioration and loss of credit of the Long-Bell Lumber Company. These included discussion of an attempt to consolidate the Long-Bell Company with other lumber producers in the effort, as stated by Long- Bell's officers to respondent, 'to meet quickly an acute and distressing situation'; efforts to procure loans and to convert Long-Bell property into cash; 'to strengthen the Lumber Company's current financial condition by converting physical assets into working capital to meet current requirements'; unsuccessful efforts in March and April to market secured bonds and note issues of the Long-Bell Lumber Company; unsuccessful efforts by respondent in May to secure financing for Long-Bell by New York banking houses. There was evidence from which the jury could have found that respondent had been advised by the Long-Bell Company, that the officers of the Chase National Bank of New York and a large St. Louis bank had withdrawn and refused to renew the Long-Bell Company's line of bank credit and that the Chase Bank had advised strengthening of the Lumber Company's current financial position, and had suggested the formation for credit purposes of a subsidiary corporation to which the Long-Bell could transfer its liquid assets for purposes of borrowing operations. This advice was carried into effect in October, 1930. None of these circumstances showing the changed financial condition of the Long-Bell Lumber Company after its December 31, 1929 statement or any of the information of respondent with \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 418]\n\u00a0\n respect to them were revealed by respondent or known to petitioner before purchasing the improvement bonds.\n Petitioner purchased from respondent $353,000 of the bonds, $100,000 on May 17, 1930, $26,000 in September, $211,000 in October, $13,000 in January, 1931 and $3,000 in February. Of these $279,000 were bonds of districts 11 and 19 which were the two districts which embraced substantially the whole city of Longview. In 1934 the Long-Bell Lumber Company filed a petition for reorganizationunder  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. By the decree in the reorganization proceeding the Lumber Company was relieved of its guarantee of the improvement district bonds, the petitioner receiving 8 and 4\/10ths shares of common stock in the reorganized corporation in lieu of the guarantee on each $1,000 bond.\n Petitioner's case as submitted to the jury was in substance that it had been induced to purchase the bonds by untrue statements knowingly or recklessly made by respondent's officers and agents as follows: (1) That the extensive mill properties of the Long-Bell Lumber Company the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, the Longview Fibre Company and others were located in Longview and subject to assessment in Local Improvement Districts Nos. 11 or 19, the limits of which were substantially co- extensive with the limits of the city; (2) that Longview had a frontage of 7 1\/4 miles upon the Columbia River which, if true, would locate the mill properties within the corporate limits; (3) that the improvement bonds were the only bonds constituting a charge or lien upon the lands in the improvement districts of the city, and, finally, (4) that respondent's officers and agents had in May, 1930, made representations of the strong financial position shown in the 1929 balance sheet of the Long-Bell Lumber Company which had guaranteed the improvement bonds, without disclosing to petitioner the knowledge which it then had or later acquired before \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 419]\n\u00a0\n the sale of the bonds, that the Long-Bell Company was in fact in a declining and precarious financial condition.\n The Court of Appeals held that the various statements and information given by respondent's officers and agents, after respondent's offering circular had been submitted to petitioner, were substantially the same as those made in the circular itself and therefore were under the protection of the hedge clause which had been printed in the circular. Stipulations by which one attempts to avoid the consequences of false statements fraudulently or recklessly made are strictly construed in the Iowa courts. Jordan v. Nelson, Iowa, 178 N.W. 544, 10 A.L.R. 1464. We are cited to no Iowa authority to the effect that such a clause applies or affords protection to any except the statements to which it refers. But we assume for present purposes, without deciding, as the Court of Appeals held, that the hedge clause extended its protection to later statements made by respondent like those contained in the circular. But in reaching its conclusion the court overlooked the fact that the documents and statements which followed the submission of the circular to petitioner were in response to a request by petitioner for additional information and contained items of information not found in the circular.\n Among them was the December 31, 1929, financial statement of the Long- Bell Lumber Company, the advertising map bearing a legend indicating the city's frontage on the river and the location of the taxing districts within the city limits, other advertising material containing pictures indicating the location of the Long-bell and other plants within the city limits, and the statement made to petitioner by respondent's sales manager that the city, which was co-extensive with the improvement district, had no funded debt. The court also failed to consider the question whether under Iowa law, the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 420]\n\u00a0\n hedge clause afforded to respondent protection from untrue statements recklessly made, whether the statements in the circular and others later submitted to petitioner were recklessly made, and whether the hedge clause itself contained statements known to respondent to be untrue and had a material influence in inducing petitioner's purchase of the bonds.\n It is obvious that the jury could have found that statements having persuasive influence in promoting the sale of the improvement bonds to the petitioner were, the statement as to the location along the waterfront and within the Improvement District of extensive manufacturing plants which would thus be subject to assessment for payment of the bonds, the statement that the city had no funded indebtedness other than the improvement bonds, and the representations as to the strong financial position of the Long-Bell Lumber Company which was guarantor of payment of the bonds. If, as the jury found, petitioner relied on these representations to its injury, it is immaterial, as appears to be conceded, that petitioner did not make its own investigation to ascertain whether they were true. Gardner v. Trenary, 65 Iowa 646, 22 N.W. 912; Creamer v. Stevens, 192 Iowa 920, 185 N.W. 581; Ford v. Ott, 186 Iowa 820, 173 N.W. 121.\n The trial court correctly charged the jury in accordance with the Iowa decisions, in substance, that as a prerequisite to a verdict for petitioner, it must find that the representations in question were known by respondent to be false or were made as true with no reasonable ground for believing them to be true, but that if they were believed by respondent to be true and were made without reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity, and without intention to deceive petitioner, petitioner could not recover. The question of respondent's recklessness was thus submitted to the jury and we think properly so \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 421]\n\u00a0\n upon the evidence. Hanson v. Kline, 136 Iowa 101, 113 N.W. 504; Davis v. Central Land Company, 162 Iowa 269, 143 N.W. 1073, 49 L.R.A.,N.S., 1219; Haigh v. White Way Laundry Co., 164 Iowa 143, 145 N.W. 473, 50 L.R.A.,N.S., 1091\n\n\n Respondent's witness, a vice president in charge of its municipal bond issues, testified that he assembled the data appearing in the circular submitted by respondent to petitioner without his ever having visited the City of Longview and without making any inquiry of the city officials or representatives as to the truth of the matters stated in the circular. So far as appears no such inquiry was made by respondent or in its behalf before the sale of the bonds to petitioner. The witness stated that he had obtained the information from the offices of the Long-Bell Lumber Company at Kansas City and Longview; that he had submitted the circular when prepared to the general counsel of the Long-Bell Lumber Company at Kansas City, who had approved it. Whether counsel has any personal knowledge of the matters stated in the circular or what he stated to respondent with respect to it does not appear. The information about the 7 1\/4 mile frontage of the city on the Columbia River and the location of the Long-Bell, Weyerhaeuser and other plants within the limits of the improvement districts was compiled by the witness from advertising copy suggested by the advertising manager of the Long-Bell Lumber Company. His recollection was that some of this information came from an address made 'by one of the Long-Bell land agents at Longview'.\n No testimony was forthcoming to show that any executive officer of the Long-Bell Lumber Company gave assurances of the truth or accuracy of this information, or that any of them believed it to be true. When the witness sought this information in October, 1930, he promptly obtained the correct information from the Long- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 422]\n\u00a0\n view tax authorities. The evidence is conflicting whether this information ever was communicated to petitioner, and if so whether before its October purchase of the bonds. Petitioner's testimony was that it first acquired the information in June, 1931. Two of respondent's vice presidents had visited Longview two or more times in 1922 and 1924 in connection with the purchase by respondent of Long-Bell bond issues. Both testified as witnesses, but neither of them denied knowledge of the location of the corporate limits of the City of Longview and of the mill properties. Another vice president in charge of purchases of municipal issues had made a trip to Longview in 1925 and while there had entered into a contract with the Lumber Company for the purchase from it by respondent of the improvement bonds. He also arranged in that year for the purchase from Long-Bell Lumber Company by respondent of the diking district bonds, already referred to. This vice president, having died, did not testify, but there was testimony by his assistant and successor that the location of the diking district was ascertained by respondent at that time.\n The only identified sources of respondent's information as to the location of the city on the river and the location of the manufacturing plants with respect to the taxing districts, were and advertising agent of the Long-Bell Lumber Company, a land agent acting either for the Long-Bell Lumber Company or its subsidiary, and a map with a descriptive material printed on it appearing as a part of a published advertisement of the Longview Company which promoted the real estate enterprise in Longview. None of this information was verified by any responsible official of the Long-Bell Lumber Company nor by any official or representative of the City of Longview, and no such verification appears to have been sought by respondent. We think it was for the jury to say whether statements resting upon such flimsy support, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 423]\n\u00a0\n made as the basis for a public offering of municipal bonds aggregating more than $3,000,000, were recklessly made, or were without reasonable basis for the assertion of their truth to prospective investors.\n The court below thought the statement made by respondent's sales manager, despite the outstanding diking district bonds, that the city was without funded debt other than the improvement district bonds, was carelessly made but trivial in its effect in inducing the purchase of the bonds. But we cannot say that the trial court should not have left it to the jury to decide whether this statement was knowingly false or recklessly made, or whether in all the circumstances it materially influenced petitioner's purchase of the bonds. Moreover, we think that in all the circumstances of the case the trial court rightly left it to the jury to say whether in fact respondent in the course of its investigation, through its vice presidents or others, of issues of bonds totalling more than $30,000,000, issued either by the City of Longview or the Long-Bell Lumber Company or bearing its guarantee, became aware of the actual location of the properties in question.\n Petitioner also insists that the jury could have found that the hedge clause itself was known by respondent to be untrue when made. The clause declared that the statements contained in the circular 'are based on information which we regard as reliable and ... we ourselves have relied upon them in the purchase of this security'. Yet, respondent's vice president in charge of municipal issues, who had prepared the offering circular, testified, without contradiction, 'We bought and sold the bonds solely on the guarantee of the Long-Bell Lumber Company paying no attention whatever to the valuation of the lands upon which the assessments were laid'. Upon this state of the record the jury could have found that the hedge clause itself was untrue and would mislead \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 424]\n\u00a0\n prospective purchasers to the erroneous belief that Halsey, Stuart & Co. regarded the bonds as worthy investments on their merits either independently or in conjunction with the guarantee. It could have found also that its materiality was of added importance in influencing the sale of the bonds in view of the knowledge of respondent, not disclosed to petitioner, that the Long-Bell Lumber Company was already in financial straits.\n While it is arguable, as the court below thought, whether in view of all the circumstances petitioner placed more or less reliance upon the obligations attaching to a municipal security on the one hand or upon the guarantee of the Long-Bell Lumber Company on the other, or whether it would have scrutinized more searchingly the guarantee had it known that respondent depended on that alone, these are arguments for the jury and not the court.\n The court below held that the failure of respondent to reveal to petitioner its knowledge of the declining financial status of the Long- Bell Lumber Company, which respondent acquired in the early months of 1930, fell short of establishing fraud or breach of legal duty on its part. The court reached this conclusion on the grounds that there was no fiduciary relationship between respondent and petitioner; that the 1929 balance sheet of the Lumber Company was not shown to be an untruthful statement of the financial condition of the Company at that time; that respondent did not seek additional information as to the financial condition of the Company and if it had done so could readily have ascertained its condition from other sources.\n But we think that, under Iowa law, these factors did not, in the circumstances of this case, relieve respondent of the duty to speak. As we have said, petitioner was under no duty to make an independent investigation of the truth of respondent's statements if, as the jury found, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 425]\n\u00a0\n it relied on those statements in the purchase of the bonds. Respondent furnished the balance sheet in response to petitioner's request for information about the Lumber Company after emphasizing to petitioner the Company's guarantee of the improvement bonds and stating 'we believe you have before you practically all the data covering this issue of bonds.' From the evidence the jury could have found that the balance sheet was submitted to petitioner as one of the bases of the pending negotiation and as a representation, that it disclosed, so far as known to respondent, the financial condition of the Company, that notwithstanding such representation respondent then knew that the Company's financial condition had so steadily and seriously declined after the date of the balance sheet as to impair substantially the value of the guarantee, and that this statement of a half truth had materially assisted in the sale of the bonds to petitioner.\n The trial court instructed the jury.\n'It is the duty of one selling securities who attempts to supply a prospective purchaser with facts concerning the issue not only to state truthfully what he actually tells but also not to suppress any facts within his knowledge which will materially change or alter the effect of the facts actually stated. To tell less than the whole truth may constitute a false and fraudulent representation. A partial and fragmentary disclosure of certain facts concerning an issue of securities accompanied by the willful concealment of material facts which change the facts actually stated, is as much a fraud as an actual positive misrepresentation'.\n\n By this instruction and others of like tenor the court left the jury free to apply to the evidence the generally accepted doctrine adopted by the American Law Institute, Restatement of Torts,  529, 551. Section 529 states:\n'A statement in a business transaction which, while stating the truth so far as it goes, the maker knows or be- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 410, 426]\n\u00a0\n lieves to be materially misleading because of his failure to state qualifying matter is a fraudulent misrepresentation.'\n\n Such a statement of a half truth is as much a misrepresentation as if the facts stated were untrue. The court's charge was in conformity to Iowa law as disclosed by its judicial opinions. See Howard v. McMillen, 101 Iowa 453, 70 N.W. 623; Noble v. Renner, 177 Iowa 509, 159 N.W. 214; Foreman v. Dugan, 205 Iowa 929, 218 N.W. 912. No argument made or authority cited here persuades us that the Supreme Court of Iowa would, upon the evidence presented, apply any different rule. See Wichita Royalty Co. v. City National Bank of Wichita Falls, \n306 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 59 S.Ct. 420, 421; cf. West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n311 \nU.S. 223\n, 61 S.Ct. 179, decided December 9, 1940.\n Respondent has raised numerous other questions which were not considered by the court below. This cause will therefore be reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE HULL(1941)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 546, 547]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In January, 1936, petitioner was convicted of a statutory sex offense and was sentenced to the Michigan state prison at Jackson, Michigan, for an indeterminate term of six months to ten years. About ten months later he was paroled. In October, 1937, he was convicted of another sex offense and was returned to the same prison to serve a sentence of two and one- half to five years from entry of the second judgment. Apparently for the sole reason that the second conviction was regarded as a violation of his parole, petitioner was given a hearing before the state parole board and was passed indefinitely toward the maximum sentence for the first offense. See Michigan Statutes Annotated, 1940 supplement,  28.2108.\n In November, 1940, petitioner prepared a petition for writ of habeas corpus and exhibits to file in this Court. He took the papers to a prison official and requested him to notarize them. The official refused and informed petitioner that the papers and a registered letter to the clerk of this Court concerning them would not be accepted for mailing. Although the papers were not notarized, petitioner then delivered them to his father for mailing outside the prison but guards confiscated them. Several days later, petitioner again attempted to mail a letter concerning his case to the clerk of this Court. It was intercepted and sent to the legal investigator for the state parole board. 1 Apparently neither of the let- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 546, 548]\n\u00a0\n ters was returned to the petitioner,2 and the papers taken from his father were not returned until late in December.\n Petitioner then prepared another document which he somehow managed to have his father, as 'agent', file with the clerk of this Court on December 26, 1940. In this document petitioner detailed his efforts to file the papers confiscated by prison officials, contended that he was therefore unlawfully restrained, and prayed that he be released.\n On January 6, 1941, we issued a rule to show cause why leave to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus should not be granted. The warden filed a return to the rule setting forth the circumstances of the two convictions, the proceedings of the parole board, and numerous exhibits. In justification of the action preventing petitioner from filing his papers or communicating with this Court, the warden alleged that in November, 1940, he had published a regulation providing that: 'All legal documents, briefs, petitions, motions, habeas corpus proceedings and appeals will first have to be submitted to the institutional welfare office and if favorably acted upon be then referred to Perry A. Maynard, legal investigator to the Parole Board, Lansing, Michigan. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 546, 549]\n\u00a0\n Documents submitted to Perry A Maynard, if in his opinion are properly drawn, will be directed to the court designated or will be referred back to the inmate.'\n In answer, petitioner filed a 'Response to the Return' which again challenged the validity of this regulation and which contained numerous exhibits. One of the exhibits was the petition for writ of habeas corpus taken from petitioner's father. In brief, this petition assailed the legality of petitioner's imprisonment under the second conviction on the ground that he had been denied procedural due process.\n The first question concerns the effect of the regulation quoted in the warden's return.\n The regulation is invalid. The considerations that prompted its formulation are not without merit, but the state and its officers may not abridge or impair petitioner's right to apply to a federal court for a writ of habeas corpus. Whether a petition for writ of habeas corpus addressed to a federal court is properly drawn and what allegations it must contain are questions for that court alone to determine. Compare First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 346\n, 46 S.Ct. 135, 137; Erie Railroad v. Purdy, \n185 \nU.S. 148, 152\n, 22 S.Ct. 605, 606; Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 20 S.Ct. 687, 689; see Ex parte Sharp, D.C., 33 F.Supp. 464.\n However, the invalidity of the prison regulation does not compel petitioner's release. For that reason it is necessary to examine the petition annexed to the response. Although it is here as an exhibit to the response, it may be considered as a motion for leave to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus inasmuch as the warden has not had an opportunity to answer it. The next question, therefore, is whether this petition is premature.\n The petition is not premature. Compare McNally v. Hill, \n293 \nU.S. 131\n, 55 S.Ct. 24; Re Bonner, \n151 \nU.S. 242\n, 14 S.Ct. 323. Despite \n\n[312 \nU.S. 546, 550]\n\u00a0\n the fact that petitioner is now in prison under the sentence for the first offense, he was at liberty on parole at the time he was arrested and charged with the second offense. True, parole regulations obligated him to stay within Jackson County but that is not the imprisonment present in the McNally case. Moreover, petitioner's parole was revoked and he was ordered to serve out his first sentence only because of the second conviction. See Michigan Statutes Annotated, supra. There is no reason to suppose that he can compel the parole board to review the record of the second conviction, or to make a declaratory ruling that if that conviction is void his parole will be reinstated. Thus the last question is whether the petition, treated as a motion for leave to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus, is sufficient to necessitate an order requiring the warden to answer.\n At bottom, petitioner's case is this: that in the second trial there was a variance between pleading and proof with respect to the date when the offense was committed, and that petitioner thus was denied the fair notice of the charge guaranteed by the due process clause. From exhibits and rather vague statements in the petition, the following appears: that in his opening statement and throughout the trial the prosecutor insisted that the offense occurred on the date charged in the information; that petitioner's defense was that he was elsewhere at the time in question; that some of the testimony tended to fix the date of the offense about a week earlier than that charged in the indictment; that at the close of all the evidence, petitioner's counsel moved for a directed verdict on the ground that there was no evidence to prove that the offense was committed on the date charged in the information; that the trial judge denied this motion and charged the jury that the precise date was immaterial, it being sufficient to show that the offense occurred during the month previous; that the trial judge \n\n[312 \nU.S. 546, 551]\n\u00a0\n entered judgment on the jury's verdict of guilty and denied petitioner's motion for a new trial on the same ground urged in the motion for directed verdict; and that the Michigan Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari.\n We conclude that the showing made by the petition and exhibits is insufficient to compel an order requiring the warden to answer. Petitioner was represented by counsel throughout the second trial. Yet there is no claim in the petition that he objected to evidence tending to establish a different date for commission of the offense, or that he claimed surprise, or that he moved for a continuance to enable him to secure other witnesses. He does not allege that at the time of the trial he had an alibi for any other date, nor does he make clear the actual extent of any variance. Furthermore, ascertainment of these facts is impossible since petitioner has not furnished the transcript taken at the second trial. Accordingly, it would be improper to inquire whether petitioner was denied procedural due process in the second trial. Compare Hardy v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 224, 225\n, 22 S.Ct. 889; Ledbetter v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 606, 612\n, 18 S.Ct. 774, 776; Hodgson v. Vermont, \n168 \nU.S. 262, 271\n, 18 S.Ct. 80, 82; Matthews v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 500\n, 16 S.Ct. 640.\n The motion for leave to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus is therefore denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] About a week later petitioner received the following reply from the legal investigator: 'Your letter of November 18, 1940, addressed to the Clerk of the United States Supreme Court, has been referred to the writer for reply. In the first place your application in its present form would not be acceptable to that court. You must file a petition for whatever relief you are seeking and state your reasons therefor, together with a memorandum brief. Your petition must be verified under oath and supported by proper affidavits, if any you have. Your letter was, no doubt, intercepted for the reason that it was deemed to be inadequate and which undoubtedly accounts for the fact that it found its way to my desk.'\n Apparently the legal investigator serves as attorney and advisor to the state parole board. His functions with respect to legal documents of prison inmates appear more fully from the prison regulation quoted hereafter. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Neither of the letters reached the clerk of this Court. On December 12, 1940, petitioner requested the prison superintendent of mail to trace the registered letter since he had not received the return receipt which accompanied it. The assistant superintendent replied: 'This was mailed thru Perry Maynard by orders from Warden.' Apparently the legal investigator made no reply. \n\n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFASHION ORIGINATORS' GUILD v. FEDERAL TRADE COM'N(1941)\nNo. 537\nArgued: February 10, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n As Amended Mar. 31, 1941. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 458]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles B. Rugg, of Boston, Mass., and Milton C. Weisman, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Biddle, Sol. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, with modifications not here challenged, affirmed a Federal Trade Commission decree ordering petitioners to cease and desist from certain practices found to have been done in combination and to constitute 'unfair methods of competition' tending to monopoly. \n1\n Determination of the correctness of the decision below requires consideration of the Sherman, Clayton, and Federal Trade Commission Acts. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n Some of the members of the combination design, manufacture, sell and distribute women's garments-chiefly dresses. Others are manufacturers, converters or dyers of textiles from which these garments are made. Fashion Originators' Guild of America (FOGA), an organization controlled by these groups, is the instrument through which petitioners work to accomplish the purposes condemned by the Commission. The garment manufacturers claim to be creators of original and distinctive designs of fashionable clothes for women, and the textile manufacturers claim to be creators of similar original fabric designs. After these designs enter the channels of trade, other manufacturers systematically make and sell copies of them, the copies usually selling at prices lower than the garments copied. Petitioners call this practice of copying unethical and immoral, and give it the name of 'style piracy.' And although they admit that their 'original creations' are neither copyrighted nor patented, and indeed assert that existing legislation affords them no protection against copyists, they nevertheless urge that sale of copied designs constitutes an unfair trade practice and a tortious invasion of their rights. Because of these alleged wrongs, petitioners, while continuing to compete with one another in many respects, combined among themselves to combat and, if possible, destroy all competition from the sale of garments which are copies of their 'original creations.' They admit that to destroy such competition they have in combination purposely boycotted and declined to sell their products to retailers who follow a policy of selling garments copied by other manufacturers from designs put out by Guild members. As a result of their efforts, approximately 12,000 retailers throughout the country have signed agreements to 'cooperate' with the Guild's boycott program, but more than half of these signed the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n agreements only because constrained by threats that Guild members would not sell to retailers who failed to yield to their demands-threats that have been carried out by the Guild practice of placing on red cards the names of noncooperators (to whom no sales are to be made), placing on white cards the names of cooperators (to whom sales are to be made), and then distributing both sets of cards to the manufacturers.\n The one hundred and seventy-six manufacturers of women's garments who are members of the Guild occupy a commanding position in their line of business. In 1936, they sold in the United States more than 38% of all women's garments wholesaling at $6.75 and up, and more than 60% of those at $10.75 and above. The power of the combination is great; competition and the demand of the consuming public make it necessary for most retail dealers to stock some of the products of these manufacturers. And the power of the combination is made even greater by reason of the affiliation of some members of the National Federation of Textiles, Inc.-that being an organization composed of about one hundred textile manufacturers, converters, dyers, and printers of silk and rayon used in making women's garments. Those members of the Federation who are affiliated with the Guild have agreed to sell their products only to those garment manufacturers who have in turn agreed to sell only to cooperating retailers.\n The Guild maintains a Design Registration Bureau for garments, and the Textile Federation maintains a similar Bureau for textiles. The Guild employs 'shoppers' to visit the stores of both cooperating and non- cooperating retailers, 'for the purpose of examining their stocks, to determine and report as to whether they contain ... copies of registered designs ....' An elaborate system of trial and appellate tribunals exists, for the determination of whether a given garment is in fact a copy of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n a Guild member's design. In order to assure the success of its plan of registration and restraint, and to ascertain whether Guild regulations are being violated, the Guild audits its members books. And if violations of Guild requirements are discovered, as, for example, sales to red-carded retailers, the violators are subject to heavy fines. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In addition to the elements of the agreement set out above, all of which relate more or less closely to competition by so-called style copyists, the Guild has undertaken to do many things apparently independent of and distinct from the fight against copying. Among them are the following: the combination prohibits its members from participating in retail advertising; regulates the discount they may allow; prohibits their selling at retail; cooperates with local guilds in regulating days upon which special sales shall be held; prohibits its members from selling women's garments to persons who conduct businesses in residences, residential quarters, hotels or apartment houses; and denies the benefits of membership to retailers who participate with dress manufacturers in promoting fashion shows unless the merchandise used is actually purchased and delivered.\n If the purpose and practice of the combination of garment manufacturers and their affiliates runs counter to the public policy declared in the Sherman and Clayton Acts, the Federal Trade Commission has the power to suppress it as an unfair method of competition. \n4\n From \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n its findings the Commission concluded that the petitioners, 'pursuant to understandings, arrangements, agreements, combinations and conspiracies entered into jointly and severally', had prevented sales in interstate commerce, had 'substantially lessened, hindered and suppressed' competition, and had tended 'to create in themselves a monopoly.' And paragraph 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  14, 15 U.S.C.A.  14, declares 'It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce ... to ... make a sale or contract for sale of goods ... on the condition, agreement or understanding that the ... purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods ... of a competitor or competitors of the ... seller, where the effect of such ... sale, or contract for sale ... may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.' The relevance of this section of the Clayton Act to petitioners' scheme is shown by the fact that the scheme is bottomed upon a system of sale under which (1) textiles shall be sold to garment manufacturers only upon the condition and understanding that the buyers will not use or deal in textiles which are copied from the designs of textile manufacturing Guild members; (2) garment manufacturers shall sell to retailers only upon the condition and understanding that the retailers shall not use or deal in such copied designs. And the Federal Trade Commission concluded in the language of the Clayton Act that these understandings substantially lessened competition and tended to create a monopoly. We hold that the Commission, upon adequate and unchallenged findings, correctly concluded that this practice constituted an unfair method of competition. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n Not only does the plan in the respects above discussed thus conflict with the principles of the Clayton Act; the findings of the Commission bring petitioners' combination in its entirety well within the inhibition of the policies declared by the Sherman Act itself. Section 1 of that Act makes illegal every contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states; Section 2 makes illegal every combination or conspiracy which monopolizes or attempts to monopolize any part of that trade or commerce. Under the Sherman Act 'competition, not combination, should be the law of trade.' National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, \n197 \nU.S. 115, 129\n, 25 S.Ct. 379, 381, 382. And among the many respects in which the Guild's plan runs contrary to the policy of the Sherman Act are these: it narrows the outlets to which garment and textile manufacturers can sell and the sources from which retailers can buy ( Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38, 45\n, 24 S.Ct. 307, 309; Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20, 48\n, 49 S., 33 S.Ct. 9, 14, 15); subjects all retailers and manufacturers who decline to comply with the Guild's program to an organized boycott (Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600\n, 609-611, 34 S.Ct. 951, 953, 954, L.R.A.1915A, 788); takes away the freedom of action of members by requiring each to reveal to the Guild the intimate details of their individual affairs (United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371, 389\n, 43 S.Ct. 607, 611); and has both as its necessary tendency and as its purpose and effect the direct suppression of competition from the sale of unregistered textiles and copied designs ( United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., supra, 262 U.S. at 389, 43 S.Ct. at 611). In addition to all this, the combination is in reality an extra-governmental agency, which prescribes rules for the regulation and restraint of interstate commerce, and provides extra- judicial tribunals for determination and punishment of violations, and thus 'trenches upon the power of the national legislature and violates the statute.' \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 466]\n\u00a0\n Addyston Pipe 3 Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 242\n, 20 S.Ct. 96, 107.\n Nor is it determinative in considering the policy of the Sherman Act that petitioners may not yet have achieved a complete monopoly. For 'it is sufficient if it really tends to that end, and to deprive the public of the advantages which flow from free competition.' United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 15 S.Ct. 249, 255; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 237\n, 20 S.Ct. 96, 105. It was, in fact, one of the hopes of those who sponsored the Federal Trade Commission Act that its effect might be prophylactic and that through it attempts to bring about complete monopolization of an industry might be stopped in their incipiency. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners, however, argue that the combination cannot be contrary to the policy of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, since the Federal Trade Commission did not find that the combination fixed or regulated prices, parcelled out or limited production, or brought about a deterioration in quality. But action falling into these three categories does not exhaust the types of conduct banned by the Sherman and Clayton Acts. And as previously pointed out, it was the object of the Federal Trade Commission Act to reach not merely in their fruition but also in their incipiency combinations which could lead to these and other trade restraints and practices deemed undesirable. In this case, the Commission found that the combination exercised sufficient control and power in the women's garments and textile businesses 'to exclude from the industry those manufacturers and distributors who do not conform to the rules and regulations of said respondents, and thus tend to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 467]\n\u00a0\n create in themselves a monopoly in the said industries.' While a conspiracy to fix prices is illegal, an intent to increase prices is not an ever-present essential of conduct amounting to a violation of the policy of the Sherman and Clayton Acts; a monopoly contrary to their policies can exist even though a combination may temporarily or even permanently reduce the price of the articles manufactured or sold. For as this Court has said, 'Trade or commerce under those circumstances may nevertheless be badly and unfortunately restrained by driving out of business the small dealers and worthy men whose lives have been spent therein, and who might be unable to readjust themselves to their altered surroundings. Mere reduction in the price of the commodity dealt in might be dearly paid for by the ruin of such a class and the absorption of control over one commodity by an allpowerful combination of capital.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n But petitioners further argue that their boycott and restraint of interstate trade is not within the ban of the policies of the Sherman and Clayton Acts because 'the practices of FOGA were reasonable and necessary to protect the manufacturer, laborer, retailer and consumer against the devastating evils growing from the pirating of original designs and had in fact benefited all four.' The Commission declined to hear much of the evidence that petitioners desired to offer on this subject. As we have pointed out, however, the aim of petitioners' combination was the intentional destruction of one type of manufacture and sale which competed with Guild members. The purpose and object of this combination, its potential power, its tendency to monopoly, the coercion it could and did practice upon a rival method of competition, all brought it within the policy of the prohibition \n\n[312 \nU.S. 457, 468]\n\u00a0\n declared by the Sherman and Clayton Acts. For this reason, the principles announced in Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S. Ct. 471, and Sugar Institute v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 553\n, 56 S.Ct. 629, have no application here. Under these circumstances it was not error to refuse to hear the evidence offered, for the reasonableness of the methods pursued by the combination to accomplish its unlawful object is no more material than would be the reasonableness of the prices fixed by unlawful combination. Cf. Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 \nU.S. 66, 85\n, 37 S.Ct. 353, 359, Ann.Cas.1917D, 322; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392, 398\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 379, 50 A.L.R. 989; United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 212-224, 60 S.Ct. 811, 839-844. Nor can the unlawful combination be justified upon the argument that systematic copying of dress designs is itself tortious, or should now be declared so by us. In the first place, whether or not given conduct is tortious is a question of state law, under our decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. In the second place, even if copying were an acknowledged tort under the law of every state, that situation would not justify petitioners in combining together to regulate and restrain interstate commerce in violation of federal law. And for these same reasons, the principles declared in International News Service v. Associated Press, \n248 \nU.S. 215\n, 39 S.Ct. 68, 2 A. L.R. 293, cannot serve to legalize petitioners' unlawful combination. The decision below is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 80.

BISMARCK LUMBER CO.(1941)\nNo. 76\nArgued: October 23, 1941Decided: November 10, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 96]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. P. O. Sathre, of Bismarck, N.D., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to decide whether in view of section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916, c. 245, 39 Stat. 360, 380, 12 U.S.C.A.  931-933,1 petitioner is subject to \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n the Sales Tax Act of North Dakota,2 the pertinent sections of which are set forth in the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner, the Federal Land Bank of St. Paul, was created pursuant to the Federal Farm Loan Act, supra. In the course of its operations it acquired by foreclosure proceedings certain farm properties in Burleigh County, North Dakota. \n4\n To effect necessary repairs and improvements to the buildings and fences on these properties, petitioner purchased lumber and other building materials of an aggregate value of $408.26 from the Bismarck Lumber Company, a retail dealer. The Lumber Company demanded the sum of $8.02 from petitioner, representing the total amount of the state sales tax on the various purchases. This petitioner refused to pay. On March 9, 1938, petitioner filed a complaint in the District Court of Burleigh County against the Lumber Company and the State Tax Commissioner, 5 alleging the foregoing facts and praying for an adjudication of nonliability for the sales tax on the ground that petitioner is exempt under section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, supra, and the federal Constitution. To this complaint respondents demurred. In sustaining the demurrer the trial court held that the sales to petitioner were subject to the tax, that the Lumber Company was required to collect the tax, and that petitioner was under a legal duty to pay it. Accordingly \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n judgment was entered against petitioner in the amount of the tax. The Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co. et al., 70 N.D. 607, 297 N.W. 42. The case is here because it presents a question of importance in the administration of the Federal Farm Loan Act.\n We are confronted with two questions:\n First-Does section 26 include within its ban a state sales tax such as this? We hold that it does.\n Second-Can Congress constitutionally immunize from state taxation activities in furtherance of the lending functions of federal land banks? We hold that it can.\n I. It is clear that the North Dakota statute makes the purchaser, petitioner here, liable for the sales tax. Section 6 of the Act requires the retailer to add the tax to the sales price and declares the tax to be a debt from the consumer to the retailer. Section 7 makes it unlawful for the retailer to hold out that he will absorb or refund the tax in whole or in part. The Supreme Court of North Dakota has held that the sales tax is laid upon the purchaser. Jewel Tea Company v. State Tax Commissioner, 70 N. D. 229, 293 N.W. 386. This holding was reaffirmed in the decision below. These determinations of the incidence of the tax by the state court are controlling, and respondents concede the point.\n The unqualified term 'taxation' used in section 26 clearly encompasses within its scope a sales tax such as the instant one, and this conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the section. In reaching an opposite conclusion the court below ignored the plain language, 'That every Federal land bank ... shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation', and seized upon the phrase, 'including the capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom', as delimiting the scope of the exemption. The protection of section 26 cannot thus be frittered away. We recently had occasion under other \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n circumstances to point out that the term 'including' is not one of all- embracing definition, but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 189\n, 61 S.Ct. 845, 850, 133 A.L.R. 1217; see also Helvering v. Morgan's, Inc., \n293 \nU.S. 121, 125\n, 55 S.Ct. 60, 61. If the broad exemption accorded to 'every Federal land bank' were limited to the specific illustrations mentioned in the participial phrase introduced by 'including', there would have been no necessity to except from the purview of section 26 the real estate held by the land banks.\n The additional exemptions granted to farm loan bonds and first mortgages executed to the land banks are proper additions to the general exemption of section 26. The bonds may be held by private persons, and, of course, the general exemption of section 26 would not extend to them. Likewise the general exemption would protect mortgages executed to the land banks and held by them, but it would not survive a transfer.\n Nothing in the legislative history of section 26 commands a contrary result, 6 and a broad construction is indicated by Congress' intention to advance credit to farm borrowers at the lowest possible interest rate. The legislative history of similar exemption clauses in other statutes supports our interpretation of section 26.7 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n It cannot be seriously contended that the tax falls within the real estate exception to section 26. Obviously a tax upon the sale of building materials to be used on the real estate of a federal land bank is not a tax upon that real estate.\n II. The principal argument of respondents, and the major ground of the decision below, is that Congress cannot constitutionally immunize the lending functions, or the activities incidental thereto, of federal land banks from state taxation. It runs in this fashion: Congress has authority to extend immunity only to the governmental functions of the federal land banks; the only governmental functions of the land banks are those performed by acting as depositaries and fiscal agents for the federal government8 and providing a market for government bonds;9 all other functions of the land banks are private; petitioner here was engaged in an activity incidental to its business of lending money, an essentially private function; therefore section 26 cannot operate to strike down a sales tax upon purchases made in furtherance of petitioner's lending functions. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n The argument that the lending functions of the federal land banks are proprietary rather than governmental misconceives the nature of the federal government with respect to every function which it performs. The federal government is one of delegated powers, and from that it necessarily follows that any constitutional exercise of its delegated powers is governmental. Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466, 477\n, 59 S.Ct. 595, 596, 120 A.L.R. 1466. It also follows that when Congress constitutionally creates a corporation through which the federal government lawfully acts, the activities of such corporation are governmental. Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 21, 32\n, 60 S.Ct. 15, 17, 124 A.L.R. 1263; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, supra, 306 U.S. page 477, 59 S.Ct. page 596, 120 A. L.R. 1466\n\n\n The federal land banks are constitutionally created, Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n, 41 S.Ct. 243, and respondents do not urge otherwise. Through the land banks the federal government makes possible the extension of credit on liberal terms to farm borrowers. As part of their general lending functions the land banks are authorized to foreclose their mortgages and to purchase the real estate at the resulting sale. \n10\n They are 'instrumentalities of the federal government, engaged in the performance of an important governmental function.' Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, \n295 \nU.S. 229, 231\n, 55 S.Ct. 705, 706; Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, \n290 \nU.S. 247, 254\n, 54 S. Ct. 168, 171. The national farm loan associations,11 the local co-operative organizations of borrowers through which the land banks make loans to individuals, are also federal instrumentalities. Knox National F.L. Asso. v. Phillips, \n300 \nU.S. 194, 202\n, 57 S.Ct. 418, 422, 108 A.L.R. 738; Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, supra, 290 U.S. page 254, 54 S.Ct. page 171.\n Congress has the power to protect the instrumentalities which it has constitutionally created. This conclusion follows naturally from the express grant of power to Congress 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n for carrying into execution all powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States. Const. Art. I, sec. 8, cl. 18, U.S.C.A.' Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 21, 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 15, 18, 124 A.L.R. 1263, and cases cited. We have held on three occasions that Congress has authority to prescribe tax immunity for activities connected with, or in furtherance of, the lending functions of federal credit agencies. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S.Ct. 385, 29 A.L.R. 1; Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., supra. \n12\n The first two of these cases dealt with the very section 26 now in issue. They are conclusive here.\n In support of their argument respondents rely on Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra, and Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, supra. In the Smith case we held that farm loan bonds, which might be secured by first mortgages accumulated in the course of the land banks' lending activities, 13 could be exempted from state taxation. In the Priddy case, merely as an aid to the proper construction of section 4 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, 12 U.S.C.A.  671-683, giving the land banks the right to sue and be sued 'as fully as natural persons', we noted that the land banks possessed some of the characteristics of private business corporations. \n14\n Their character as federal instrumentalities was specifically affirmed and the broad tax immunity granted to them was not questioned. Manifestly these cases do not support respondents' constitutional theories.\n We cannot accede to the suggestion that the Smith and Crosland cases can be distinguished, as they were by the state court, on the ground that a sales tax upon purchases made by petitioner in furtherance of its lending functions, unlike the taxes in those cases, bears so remotely upon \n\n[314 \nU.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n petitioner's functions as to be beyond the power of Congress to prohibit. We have found that the instant tax is within the scope of section 26 and that section is a valid enactment. It is not our function to speculate whether the immunity from one type of tax as contrasted with another is wise. That is a question solely for Congress, acting within its constitutional sphere, to determine. Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., supra, 308 U.S. page 33, 60 S.Ct. page 18, 124 A.L.R. 1263; Smith v.

BUNTE BROS.(1941)\nNo. 85\nArgued: January 6, 1941Decided: February 17, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Hugh B. Cox, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Theodore E. Rein, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Federal Trade Commission found that Bunte Brothers, candy manufacturers in Illinois, sold products there is what the trade calls 'break and take' packages, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 350]\n\u00a0\n which makes the amount the purchaser receives dependent upon chance; and that thereby it was enabled in the Illinois market to compete unfairly with manufacturers outside of Illinois who could not indulge in this device because the Trade Commission has barred 'break and take' packages as an 'unfair method of competition'. Federal Trade Commission Act,  5(a), 38 Stat. 719, as amended 15 U.S.C.  45(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  45(a); Federal Trade Comm. v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., \n291 \nU.S. 304\n, 54 S.Ct. 423. Deeming the 'break and take' sales unfair methods of competition under  5, even though the sales took place wholly within Illinois, the Commission forbade Bunte Brothers further use of the device. The Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the order, 7 Cir., 110 F.2d 412, and we brought the case here because the issue at stake presents an important aspect of the interplay of state and federal authority. \n311 \nU.S. 624\n, 61 S.Ct. 10, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The scope of  5 is in controversy. \n1\n That section, the court below held, authorizes the Commission to proceed only against business practices employed in interstate commerce. The Commission urges that its powers are not so restricted, that it may also proscribe unfair methods used in intrastate sales when these result in a handicap to interstate competitors.\n While one may not end with the words of a disputed statute, one certainly begins there. 'Unfair methods of competition in commerce' are the concern of  5, and the Commission is 'directed to prevent persons ... from using unfair methods of competition in com- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n merce ....' The 'commerce' in which these methods are barred is interstate commerce. \n2\n Neither ordinary English speech nor the considered language of legislation would aptly describe the sales by Bunte Brothers of its 'break and take' assortments in Illinois as 'using unfair methods of competition in (interstate) commerce'. When in order to protect interstate commerce Congress has regulated activities which in isolation are merely local, it has normally conveyed its purpose explicitly. See, for example, National Labor Relations Act,  2(7), 9(c), 10(a), 49 Stat. 450, 453, 29 U.S.C.  152(7), 159(c), 160(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(7), 159(c ), 160(a); Bituminous Coal Act,  4-A, 50 Stat. 83, 15 U.S.C.  834, 15 U. S.C.A.  834; Federal Employers' Liability Act,  1, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U.S.C.  51, 45 U.S.C.A.  51. To be sure, the construction of every such statute presents a unique problem in which words derive vitality from the aim and nature of the specific legislation. But bearing in mind that in ascertaining the scope of congressional legislation a due regard for a proper adjustment of the local and national interests in our federal scheme must always be in the background, we ought not to find in  5 radiations beyond the obvious meaning of language unless otherwise the purpose of the Act would be defeated. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 398-412, 33 S.Ct. 729, 739, 745, 48 L. R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18.\n That for a quarter century the Commission has made no such claim is a powerful indication that effective enforcement of the Trade Commission Act is not dependent \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n on control over intrastate transactions. \n3\n Authority actually granted by Congress of course cannot evaporate through lack of administrative exercise. But just as established practice may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is equally significant in determining whether such power was actually conferred. See Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n, 53 S.Ct. 350, 358. This practical construction of the Act by those entrusted with its administration is reinforced by the Commission's unsuccessful attempt in 1935 to secure from Congress an express grant of authority over transactions 'affecting' commerce in addition to its control of practices in commerce. S.Rep.No. 46, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. These circumstances are all the more significant in that during the whole of the Commission's life the so-called Shreveport doctrine operated in the regulatory field committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission. And it is that doctrine which gives the contention of the Trade Commission its strongest support. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n Translation of an implication drawn from the special aspects of one statute to a totally different statute is treacherous business. The Interstate Commerce Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act are widely disparate in their historic settings, in the enterprises which they affect, in the range of control they exercise, and in the relation of these controls to the functioning of the federal system. We need not at this late day rehearse the considerations that led to the Shreveport decision. Houston, E. & W.T. Ry. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833. The nub of it, in the language of Chief Justice Taft, lay in the relation between intrastate and interstate railroad traffic: 'Effective control of the one must embrace some control over the other in view of the blending of both in actual operation. The same rails and the same cars carry both. The same men conduct them.' Railroad Comm. of Wisconsin v. C., B. & Q.R.R., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 237, 22 A.L.R. 1086. And so when the Interstate Commerce Commission found that the intrastate rates of a carrier subject to the Act in effect operated as a discrimination against its interstate traffic, this Court sustained the power of the Commission to bring the two rates into harmonious relation and thereby to terminate the unlawful discrimination. Congress in 1920 revised the Interstate Commerce Act and explicitly confirmed this power of the Commerce Commission. 41 Stat. 484, 49 U.S.C.  13(4), 49 U.S.C.A.  13( 4).\n There is the widest difference in practical operation between the control over local traffic intimately connected with interstate traffic and the regulatory authority here asserted. Unlike the relatively precise situation presented by rate discrimination, 'unfair competition' was designed by Congress as a flexible concept with evolving content. Federal Trade Comm. v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., supra, at pages 311, 312 of 291 U.S., at pages 425, 426 of 54 S.Ct.. It touches the greatest variety of unrelated activities. The Trade Commission in its Report \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n for 1939 lists as 'unfair competition' thirty-one diverse types of business practices which run the gamut from bribing employees of prospective customers to selling below cost for hindering competition. \n4\n The construction of  5 urged by the Commission would thus give a federal agency pervasive control over myriads of local businesses in matters heretofore traditionally left to local custom or local law. Such control bears no resemblance to the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n strictly confined authority growing out of railroad rate discrimination. An inroad upon local conditions and local standards of such farreaching import as is involved here, ought to await a clearer mandate from Congress. The problem now before us is very different from that which was recently presented by United States v. F. W. Darby Lumber Co., \n312 \nU.S. 100\n, 61 S. Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. --, decided February 3, 1941. We had there to consider the full scope of the constitutional power of Congress under the Commerce Clause in relation to the subject matter of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This case presents the narrow question of what Congress did, not what it could do. And we merely hold that to read 'unfair methods of competition in (interstate) commerce' as though it meant 'unfair methods of competition in any way affecting interstate commerce', requires, in view of all the relevent considerations, much clearer manifestation of intention than Congress has furnished.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS (dissenting).\n In my opinion the judgment should be reversed.\n The Commission found that respondent's 'use of chance assortments in the sale and distribution of its candies in Illinois has a direct and powerful burdensome effect upon interstate commerce in candies from other states to the State of Illinois, and gives respondent an undue and unreasonable preference over competitors located in other states.' The validity of that finding and of the Commission's conclusion that respondent's practices constitute unfair methods of competition are not in issue. The only question presented by this petition for certiorari is whether respondent's practices constitute unfair methods of competition 'in commerce' within the meaning of  5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n I think they do.\n Unfair competition involves not only an offender but also a victim. Here some of the victims of the unfair methods of competition are engaged in interstate commerce. The fact that the acts of the offender are intrastate is immaterial. The purpose of the Act is to protect interstate commerce against specified types of injury. So far as the jurisdiction of the Commission is concerned, it is the existence of that injury to interstate commerce not the interstate or intrastate character of the conduct causing the injury which is important. An unfair method of competition is 'in' interstate commerce not only when it has an interstate origin but also when it has a direct interstate impact. Respondent is 'using' unfair methods of competition 'in' interstate commerce when the direct effect of its conduct is to burden, stifle, or impair that commerce.\n Under the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., a contract or conspiracy may be 'in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States' even though the acts or conduct are intrastate. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 397\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, 279; United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525\n, 541-543, 33 S.Ct. 141, 144, 145, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163, 168\n, 169 S., 51 S.Ct. 421, 423. Sec. 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act is 'supplementary' to the Sherman Act. Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 647\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 589, 79 A.L.R. 1191. Like the Sherman Act it seeks 'to protect the public from abuses arising in the course of competitive interstate and foreign trade. ... The paramount aim of the act is the protection of the public from the evils likely to result from the destruction of competition or the restriction of it in a substantial degree.' Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., supra, pages 647, 648 of 283 U.S., pages 589, 590 of 51 S.Ct., 79 A.L.R. 1191. And as this Court said in Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 453\n, 42 S.Ct. 150, 154, 19 A.L.R. 882, the declaration of public policy contained in the Sherman Act is 'to be considered in determining what are unfair methods of competition, which \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n the Federal Trade Commission is empowered to condemn and suppress.' For the Federal Trade Commission Act 'undoubtedly was aimed at all the familiar methods of law violation which prosecutions under the Sherman Act had disclosed.' Federal Trade Commission v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., \n291 \nU.S. 304, 310\n, 54 S.Ct. 423, 425.\n That history, of course, does not give us license to disregard plain and unambiguous limitations on the power of the Commission. But it does admonish us to construe one of a series of legislative acts dealing with a common or related problem in light of the integrated statutory scheme. See United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n, 61 S.Ct. 463, 85 L.Ed. --, decided February 3, 1941. It warns us not to whittle away administrative power by resolving an ambiguity against the existence of that power where the full arsenal of that power is necessary to cope with the evil at hand. The evil here is direct, injurious discrimination against interstate commerce. The Commission has issued orders against some 120 of respondent's competitors prohibiting them from selling chance assortments of candy in interstate commerce. Under this decision respondent may continue to use this same unfair method of competition to increase its business at the expense of those who sell in interstate commerce and who are not free to employ the same methods in self-defense. I think the Act, an exercise by Congress of its commerce power, should be interpreted to protect interstate commerce not to permit discrimination against it.\n Such an approach was used in the Shreveport case, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833, to give the Interstate Commerce Commission control over intrastate rates which injuriously affected, through an unreasonable discrimination, traffic that was interstate. That result was reached though the Act expressly denied the Commission any jurisdiction where the 'transportation' was 'wholly within one state'. This Court said (234 U.S. at page 358, 34 S.Ct. at page 839) that those \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n words had 'appropriate reference to exclusively intrastate traffic, separately considered; to the regulation of domestic commerce, as such. The powers conferred by the act are not thereby limited where interstate commerce itself is involved.' The interrelation between the intrastate and interstate activities in the instant case is hardly less intimate than in the Shreveport case. The fact that the nexus here is economic and not physical is inconsequential. In this case as in the other the problem is the existence of administrative authority to provide effective protection of interstate commerce against discrimination. In the Shreveport case statutory doubts were resolved so as to strengthen the administrative process even against the claim that thereby the state authorities would be 'shorn of those powers which alone can justify their existence.' Similar arguments should not deter us from being tolerant of an asserted power, admittedly constitutional, to deal effectively with the realities of economic interdependence.\n The fact that a clarifying amendment to the Act was sought which would have removed the doubts as to the meaning of 'in commerce' is not material except to the extent that it shows that doubts existed. It does not aid in resolving those doubts. To be sure, recent statutes dealing with other fields have removed such doubts by explicit provisions. But they are of little aid in interpreting an earlier act in its own legislative setting. See United States v. Stewart, \n311 \nU.S. 60, 69\n, 61 S. Ct. 102. And as to the charge that for a quarter of a century the Commission made no claim to such a power, two answers may be made. In the first place, as early as 1921, the Commission urged that the doctrine of the Shreveport case permitted an interpretation of the Act which would give it control over certain intrastate activities. Canfield Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 6 Cir., 274 F. 571; Hankin, Jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, 12 Calif. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n L.Rev. 179, 197, et seq. Although the question does not appear to have been definitely settled, in 1926 the Commission received some support for its view. See Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Trade Commission, 8 Cir., 13 F.2d 673, 684. Cf. American Can Co. v. Ladoga Canning Co., 7 Cir., 44 F.2d 763, 770, 771. But in 1939 that power was denied. California Rice Industry v. Federal Trade Commission, 9 Cir., 102 F.2d 716, 723. Nonuse of the asserted power clearly cannot be inferred from that record. In the second place, it would not be relevant if this power did lay dormant for years. Mere non-use does not subtract from power which has been granted. The host of practical reasons which may defer exhaustion of administrative powers lies in the realm of policy. From that delay we can hardly infer that the need did not or does not exist.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice REED join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 5. ( 45.)

NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK(1941)\nNo. 740\nArgued: Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 222]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Link, Jr., of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Barney B. Fensterstock, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 227]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by respondent to foreclose a mortgage made in December, 1932, by Carpenter. At that time  1083 of the New York Civil Practice Act provided that the amount of the deficiency judgment was to be measured by the residue of the debt remaining unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged property and the application of the proceeds pursuant to the directions contained in the judgment. In November, 1938, a judgment of foreclosure and sale was entered for $18,401.25, and in December, 1938, the foreclosure sale was held at which the property was purchased by respondent's nominee for $4,000. The referee, appointed by the court to sell, reported a deficiency which after the inclusion of taxes, fees and expenses was computed at $16,162.12. Respondent moved to confirm the referee's report of sale and asked that a deficiency judgment be entered for that amount. Petitioner took exceptions to the report and made a cross- motion to have the court fix the value of the property for the purpose of determining the amount of the deficiency judgment on the ground that the sale \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 228]\n\u00a0\n price was 'wholly inequitable and unconscionable'. A new  10831 (L. 1938, ch. 510), effective April 7, 1938, provides in substance that the court in determining the amount of a deficiency judgment should, on appropriate motion, 'determine, upon affidavit or otherwise as it shall direct, the fair and reasonable market value of the mortgaged premises' and should deduct from the amount of the debt the 'market value as determined by the court or the sale price of the property whichever shall be the higher.' The right to recover any deficiency is made de- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 229]\n\u00a0\n pendent on the making of such a motion. The court denied petitioner's cross-motion2 and directed the entry of a deficiency judgment for $16,162. 12. The judgment of the Appellate Division denying respondent a deficiency judgment because it had not made a motion for one under the new  1083 ( 257 App.Div. 465, 13 N.Y.S.2d 600), was reversed by the Court of Appeals which held, one judge dissenting, that the new  1083 as applied to mortgage contracts previously made violated the contract clause of the Federal Constitution, article, 1,  10. 284 N.Y. 13, 29 N.E.2d 449, 130 A. L.R. 1472. We granted the petition for certiorari because of the important constitutional question which was raised, \n312 \nU.S. 674\n, 61 S.Ct. 734, 85 L. Ed. --.\n As noted by the Court of Appeals the measure of a deficiency under the new  1083 is in substance the same as that prescribed by the New York moratory deficiency \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 230]\n\u00a0\n judgment act-s 1083-a of the Civil Practice Act. The latter section was sustained by this Court under the contract clause of the Federal Constitution in Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539\n, 59 S.Ct. 702. But the Court of Appeals (284 N.Y. 13, 29 N.E.2d 451, 130 A.L.R. 1472 ), said that the new  1083, unlike the moratory deficiency judgment act, is not addressed to a declared public emergency, is unrestricted in its application, 3 'concerns merely the private contract relationship of the parties to a real property mortgage,' is not 'designed for the relief of urgent public needs,' is not 'conditioned upon any equitable factor,' leaves 'no room for the play of any equitable consideration,' benefits 'every mortgagor irrespective of the character or amount of his investment,' and burdens 'every mortgagee no matter what his necessities'. The Court pointed out that under previously existing statutes of New York the liability for a defi iency was to be finally determined by a judgment of foreclosure and sale, that the 'subsequent docketing of a deficiency judgment was a merely clerical act', and that the deficiency was to be ascertained by a sale and 'not by the estimates of witnesses or other less satisfactory evidence'. It held that that system of foreclosure 'entered into the engagement of the present parties and created and defined the legal and equitable obligations of their contract'. It also pointed out that unlike the situation in Richmond Mortgage & Loan Corp. v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., \n300 \nU.S. 124\n, 57 S.Ct. 338, 108 A.L.R. 886, there remained under the laws of New York no remedy available to the mortgagee which was 'substantially co-extensive' with that afforded by the old  1083, since, though an action at law for the debt might lie, the judgment debtor's equity of redemption could not be sold under an execution upon that judgment and since the right to bring a second action to recover a defi- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 231]\n\u00a0\n ciency resulting on a foreclosure sale, if it existed at all under the new legislation, was drastically restricted. Accordingly, it held that in light of such cases as Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118\n, 16 S.Ct. 1042, the new  1083 could not be applied to mortgage contracts previously made without violation of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.\n We take a different view. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The formula which a legislature may adopt for determining the amount of a deficiency judgment is not fixed and invariable. That which exists at the date of the execution of the mortgage does not become so embedded in the contract between the parties that it cannot be constitutionally altered. As this Court said in Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 435\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 239, 88 A.L.R. 1481, 'Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order.' And see Voeller v. Neilston Warehouse Co., \n311 \nU.S. 531\n, 61 S.Ct. 376. It is that reserved legislative power with which we are here concerned.\n The control of judicial sales of realty by courts of equity and by legislatures in order to prevent sacrificial prices has a long history. Weiner, Conflicting Functions of the Upset Price, 27 Col.L.Rev. 132, 133, et seq. In chancery sales in England during the eighteenth century there developed the practice of opening the bidding, prior to confirmation, on an offer to advance the price 10 per cent. Graffam v. Burgess, \n117 \nU.S. 180, 191\n, 6 S.Ct. 686, 691. That practice, much criticized by Lord Eldon, was gradually supplanted by reserved bidding-in the first instance by equity (Jervoise v. Clarke, 1 Jac. & W. 388) and subsequently by stat- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 232]\n\u00a0\n ute. Sale of Land by Auction Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict. c. 48,  7; Graffam v. Burgess, supra, 117 U.S. page 191, 6 S.Ct. page 691; 1 Daniell, Chancery Practice, 7th Ed. 1901, pp. 879-880. Though the early English rule of advance bidding found little foothold in this country, reserved bidding has its counterpart here in the occasional utilization by equity courts of the upset price in mortgage foreclosures. Blair v. St. Louis, H. & K.R. Co., C.C., 25 F. 232; Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, \n145 \nU.S. 349\n, 12 S.Ct. 887; 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, pp. 849, et seq.; Stetson et al., Some Legal Phases of Corporate Financing, Reorganization and Regulation, 192 , p. 202. And it is quite uniformly the rule in this country, as in England, that while equity will not set aside a sale for mere inadequacy of price,5 it will do so if the inadequacy is so great as to shock the conscience or if there are additional circumstances against its fairness, such as chilled bidding. Cocks v. Izard, 7 Wall. 559; Graffam v. Burgess, supra; Ballentyne v. Smith, \n205 \nU.S. 285\n, 27 S.Ct. 527. Beyond that, a number of states by statute have endeavored to prevent property going for a song at judicial sales. Provisions that the property shall not be sold at less than a designated percentage of its appraised value, and requirements that a stated percentage of the appraised value above the sales price must be credited on the debt are illustrative. 3 Jones, Mortgages, 8th Ed. 1928,  1695 et seq.; 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, pp. 839 et seq.\n We mention these matters here because they indicate that for about two centuries there has been a rather continuous effort either through general rule or by appeal to the chancellor in specific cases to prevent the machinery of judicial sales from becoming an instrument of oppression. And so far as mortgage foreclosures are con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 233]\n\u00a0\n cerned numerous devices have been employed to safeguard mortgagors from sales which will or may result in mortgagees collecting more than their due. The variety of formulae which has been employed to that end is ample evidence not only of the intrusion which advanced notions of fairness have made on the earlier concern for stability of judicial sales but also of the flexibility of the standards of fairness themselves. Underlying that change has been the realization that the price which property commands at a forced sale may be hardly even a rough measure of its value. The paralysis of real estate markets during periods of depression, the wide discrepancy between the money value of property to the mortgagee and the cash price which that property would receive at a forced sale, the fact that the price realized at such a sale may be a far cry from the price at which the property would be sold to a willing buyer by a willing seller reflect the considerations which have motivated departures from the theory that competitive bidding in this field amply protects the debtor.\n Mortgagees are constitutionally entitled to no more than payment in full. \n6\n Honeyman v. Jacobs, supra. They cannot be heard to complain on constitutional grounds if the legislature takes steps to see to it that they get no more than that. As we have seen, equity will intervene in individual cases where it is palpably apparent that gross unfairness is imminent. That is the law of New York. 384 N.Y. 13, 20, 29 N.E.2d 449, 130 A.L.R. 1472. And see Fisher v. Hersey, 78 N.Y. 387. But there is no constitutional reason why in lieu of the more restricted control by a court of equity the legislature cannot substitute a uniform comprehensive rule designed to reduce or to avoid in the run of cases the chance that the mort- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 234]\n\u00a0\n gagee will be paid more than once. Cf. Suring State Bank v. Giese, 210 Wis. 489, 246 N.W. 556, 85 A.L.R. 1477. Certainly under this statute it cannot be said that more than that was attempted. The 'fair and reasonable market value' of the property has an obvious and direct relevancy to a determination of the amount of the mortgagee's prospective loss. In a given case the application of a specified criterion of value may not result in a determination of actual loss with mathematical certitude. But 'incidental individual inequality' is not fatal. Phelps v. Board of Education, \n300 \nU.S. 319, 324\n, 57 S.Ct. 483, 485. The fact that men will differ in opinion as to the adequacy of any particular yardstick of value emphasizes that the appropriateness of any o e formula is peculiarly a matter for legislative determination. Certainly, so far as mortgagees are concerned, the use of the criterion of 'fair and reasonable market value' in cases where they obtain the property for a lesser amount holds promise of tempering the extremes of both inflated and depressed market prices. And so far as mortgagors are concerned, it offers some assurance that they will not be saddled with more than the amount of their obligations. To hold that mortgagees are entitled under the contract clause to retain the advantages of a forced sale would be to dignify into a constitutionally protected property right their chance to get more than the amount of their contracts. Honeyman v. Jacobs, supra. The contract clause does not protect such a strategical, procedural advantage.\n In conclusion, the statute in question, like the one involved in Richmond Mortgage & Loan Corp. v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., supra, 300 U. S. page 130, 57 S.Ct. page 340, 108 A.L.R. 886, 'cannot fairly be said to do more than restrict the mortgagee to that for which he contracted, namely, payment in full.' Here, as in that case, the obligation of the mortgagee's contract is recognized; the statute does no more than limit \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 235]\n\u00a0\n 'that right so as to prevent his obtaining more than his due.' Id., 300 U. S. page 130, 57 S.Ct. page 340, 108 A.L.R. 886. To be sure, the mortgagee retained in that case an alternative remedy while in the instant one the Court of Appeals has said that under New York law there remained no alternative remedy 'substantially coextensive' with that which had been removed. But it is clear from Honeyman v. Hanan, \n302 \nU.S. 375\n, 58 S.Ct. 273, that a requirement that the right to a deficiency judgment should be determined in the foreclosure proceeding or that a mortgagee is not entitled to a deficiency judgment unless he moves for one raises no substantial federal question. As stated by this Court in that case (302 U.S. at page 378, 58 S.Ct. at page 274), the Federal Constitution does not prevent the states from determining, on due notice and opportunity to be heard, 'by what process legal rights may be asserted or legal obligations' enforced. The principles of those cases are applicable here. The fact that an emergency was not declared to exist when this statute was passed does not bring within the protective scope of the contract clause rights which were denied such protection in Honeyman v. Jacobs, supra. See Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, supra.\n Respondent points out that earlier decisions of this Court have struck down under the contract clause, as respects contracts previously made, a state statute requiring judicial sales to bring two-thirds of the amount of the appraised value of the property. Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311; McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608. And see Gantly's Lessee v. Ewing, 3 How. 707. Those cases, however, have been confined to the special circumstances there involved. Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, supra, 290 U.S. pages 431-434, 54 S.Ct. pages 237, 238, 88 A.L.R. 1481. We cannot permit the broad language which those early decisions employed to force legislatures to be blind to the lessons which another century has taught. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 221, 236]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the New York Supreme Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

If a person who is liable to the plaintiff for the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage is made a defendant in the action, and has appeared or has been personally served with the summons, the final judgment may award payment by him of the whole residue, or so much thereof as the court may determine to be just and equitable, of the debt remaining unsatisfied, after a sale of the mortgaged property and the application of the proceeds, pursuant to the directions contained in such judgment, the amount thereof to be determined by the court as herein provided.

Such notice shall be served personally or in such other manner as the court may direct. Upon such motion the court, whether or not the respondent appears, shall determine, upon affidavit or otherwise as it shall direct, the fair and reasonable market value of the mortgaged premises as of the date such premises were bid in at auction or such nearest earlier date as there shall have been any market value thereof and shall make an order directing the entry of a deficiency judgment. Such deficiency judgment shall be for an amount equal to the sum of the amount owing by the party liable as determined by the judgment with interest, plus the amount owing on all prior liens and encumbrances with interest, plus costs and disbursements of the action including the referee's fee and disbursements, less the market value as determined by the court or the sale price of the property whichever shall be the higher. If no motion for a deficiency judgment shall be made as herein prescribed the proceeds of the sale regardless of amount shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt and no right to recover any deficiency in any action or proceeding shall exist. ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] An affidavit of a real estate broker submitted by petitioner in support of his cross-motion stated that in his opinion the fair market value of the property was $11,000.

Richberg, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certiorari brings here a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the sentences of the two petitioners who were convicted of violation of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, 50 U.S.C.A.  31 et seq., 9 Cir., 111 F.2d 712. As the affirmance turned upon a determination of the scope of the Act and its constitutionality as construed, the petition \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n was allowed because of the questions, important in enforcing this criminal statute.\n The joint indictment in three counts charged in the first count violation of section 1(b) by allegations in the words of the statute of obtaining documents 'connected with the national defense'; in the second count violation of section 2(a) in delivering and inducing the delivery of these documents to the petitioner, Gorin, the agent of a foreign nation; and in the third count of section 4 by conspiracy to deliver them to a foreign government and its agent, just named. The pertinent statutory provisions appear below. \n1\n A third party, the wife of Gorin, was joined in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n and acquitted on all three counts. The petitioners were found guilty on each count and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment to run concurrently and fines of $10,000 each. The longest term of Gorin is six years and of Salich four years.\n The proof indicated that Gorin, a citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, acted as its agent in gathering information. He sought and obtained from Salich for substantial pay the contents of over fifty reports relating chiefly to Japanese activities in the United States. These reports were in the files of the Naval Intelligence branch office at San Pedro, California. Salich, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n a naturalized, Russian-born citizen, had free access to the records as he was a civilian investigator for that office. Speaking broadly the reports detailed the coming and going on the west coast of Japanese military and civil officials as well as private citizens whose actions were deemed of possible interest to the Intelligence Office. Some statements appear as to the movements of fishing boats, suspected of espionage and as to the taking of photographs of American war vessels.\n Petitioners object to the convictions principally on the grounds (1) that the prohibitions of the act are limited to obtaining and delivering information concerning the specifically described places and things set out in the act, such as a vessel, aircraft, fort, signal station, code or signal book; and (2) that an interpretation which put within the statute the furnishing of any other information connected with or relating to the national defense than that concerning these specifically described places and things would make the act unconstitutional as violative of due process because of indefiniteness.\n The philosophy behind the insistence that the prohibitions of sections 1(b) and 2(a), upon which the indictment is based, are limited to the places and things which are specifically set out in section 1(a) relies upon the traditional freedom of discussion of matters connected with national defense which is permitted in this country. It would require, urge petitioners, the clearest sort of declaration by the Congress to bring under the statute the obtaining and delivering to a foreign government for its advantage of reports generally published and available which deal with food production, the advances of civil aeronautics, reserves of raw materials or other similar matters not directly connected with and yet of the greatest importance to national defense. The possibility of such an interpretation of the terms 'connected with' or 'relating to' national defense is to be avoided by construing \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n the act so as 'to make it a crime only to obtain information as to places and things specifically listed in section 1 as connected with or related to the national defense.' Petitioners argue that the statute should not be construed so as to leave to a jury to determine whether an innocuous report on a crop yield is 'connected' with the national defense.\n Petitioners rely upon the legislative history to support this position. \n2\n The passage of the Espionage Act3 during the World War year of 1917 attracted the close scrutiny of Congress and resulted in different bills in the two Houses which were reconciled only after a second conference report. Nothing more definite appears in this history as to the Congressional intention in regard to limiting the act's prohibitions upon which this indictment depends to the places and things in section 1(a), than that a House definition of 'national defense' which gave it a broad meaning was stricken out4 and the conference report stated as to the final form of the present act: 'Section 1 sets out the places connected with the national defense to which the prohibitions of the section apply.' Neither change seems significant on this inquiry. The House bill had not specified the places under surveillance. The Conference change made them definite. The fact that the clause 'or other place connected with the national defense' is also included in section 1(a) is \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n not an unusual manner of protecting enactments against inadvertent omissions. With this specific designation of prohibited places, the broad definition of section 1202 of the House was stricken as no longer apt and, as stated in Conference Report No. 69, section 6 of the act was therefore adopted. Obviously the purpose was to give flexibility to the designated places. \n5\n We see nothing in this legislative history to affect our conclusion which is drawn from the meaning of the entire act. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n An examination of the words of the statute satisfies us that the meaning of national defense in sections 1(b) and 2(a) cannot be limited to the places and things specified in section 1(a). Certainly there is no such express limitation in the later sections. Section 1(a) lays down the test of purpose and intent and then defines the crime as going upon or otherwise obtaining information as to named things and places connected with the national defense. Section 1(b) adopts the same purpose and intent of 1(a) and then defines the crime as copying, taking or picturing certain articles such as models, appliances, documents, and so forth of anything connected with the national defense. None of the articles specified in 1(b) are the same as the things specified in 1(a). Apparently the draftsmen of the act first set out the places to be protected, and included in that connotation ships and planes and then in 1(b) covered much of the contents of such places in the nature of plans and documents. Section 2(a), it will be observed, covers in much the same way the delivery of these movable articles or information to a foreign nation or its agent. If a govern- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n ment model of a new weapon were obtained or delivered there seems to be little logic in making its transfer a crime only when it is connected in some undefined way with the places catalogued under 1(a). It is our view that it is a crime to obtain or deliver, in violation of the intent and purposes specified, the things described in sections 1(b) and 2(a) without regard to their connection with the places and things of 1(a).\n In each of these sections the document or other thing protected is required also to be 'connected with' or 'relating to' the national defense. The sections are not simple prohibitions against obtaining or delivering to foreign powers information which a jury may consider relating to national defense. If this were the language, it would need to be tested by the inquiry as to whether it had double meaning7 or forced anyone, at his peril, to speculate as to whether certain actions violated the statute. \n8\n This Court has frequently held criminal laws deemed to violate these tests invalid. United States v. Cohen Grocery Company,9 urged as a precedent by petitioners, points out that the statute there under consideration forbade no specific act,10 that it really punished acts 'detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable' in a jury's view. In Lanzetta v. New Jersey11 the statute was equally vague. 'Any person not engaged in any lawful occupation, known to be a member of any gang ..., who has been convicted at least three times of being a disorderly person or who has been convicted \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 27]\n\u00a0\n of any crime in this or in any other State, is declared to be a gangster ....' We there said that the statute 'condemns no act or omission'; that the vagueness is such as to violate due process. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n But we find no uncertainty in this statute which deprives a person of the ability to predetermine whether a contemplated action is criminal under the provisions of this law. \n13\n The obvious delimiting words in the statute are those requiring 'intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 28]\n\u00a0\n nation.' This requires those prosecuted to have acted in bad faith. The sanctions apply only when scienter is established. \n14\n Where there is no occasion for secrecy, as with reports relating to national defense, published by authority of Congress or the military departments, there can, of course, in all likelihood be no reasonable intent to give an advantage to a foreign government. Finally, we are of the view that the use of the words 'national defense' has given them, as here employed, a well understood connotation. They were used in the Defense Secrets Act of 1911. 15 The traditional concept of war as a struggle between nations is not changed by the intensity of support given to the armed forces by civilians or the extension of the combat area. National defense, the Government maintains, 'is a generic concept of broad connotations, referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national preparedness.' We agree that the words 'national defense' in the Espionage Act carry that meaning. Whether a document or report is covered by sections 1(b) or 2(a) depends upon their relation to the national defense, as so defined, not upon their connection with places specified in section 1(a). The language employed appears sufficiently definite to apprise the public of prohibited activities and is consonant with due process.\n At the conclusion of all the evidence petitioners sought a directed verdict of acquittal because (1) the innocuous character of the evidence forbade a conclusion that petitioners had intent or reason to believe that the informa- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 29]\n\u00a0\n tion was to be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of a foreign nation and (2) the evidence failed to disclose that any of the reports related to or was connected with the national defense. As a corollary to this second contention, reversal is sought on the ground that the trial court overruled the petitioners' objection that as a matter of law none of the reports dealt with national defense. That is, as the trial court stated the objection, that 'the jury has no privilege in determining whether or no any of these reports have to do with the national defense, that that is a matter for the Court and not for the jury, as a matter of law.'\n To justify a court's refusing to permit a jury to consider a defendant's intent in obtaining and delivering these reports, one would be compelled to conclude that nothing in them could be violative of the law. As they gave a detailed picture of the counter-espionage work of the Naval Intelligence, drawn from its own files, they must be considered as dealing with activities of the military forces. A foreign government in possession of this information would be in a position to use it either for itself, in following the movements of the agents reported upon, or as a check upon this country's efficiency in ferreting out foreign espionage. It could use the reports to advise the state of the persons involved of the surveillance exercised by the United States over the movements of these foreign citizens. The reports, in short, are a part of this nation's plan for armed defense. The part relating to espionage and counter-espionage cannot be viewed as separated from the whole.\n Nor do we think it necessary to prove that the information obtained was to be used to the injury of the United States. The statute is explicit in phrasing the crime of espionage as an act of obtaining information relating to the national defense 'to be used ... to the advantage of any foreign nation.' No distinction \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 30]\n\u00a0\n is made between friend or enemy. Unhappily the status of a foreign government may change. The evil which the statute punishes is the obtaining or furnishing of this guarded information, either to our hurt or another's gain. If we accept petitioners' contention that 'advantage' means advantage as against the United States, it would be a useless addition, as no advantage could be given our competitor or opponent in that sense without injury to us.\n An examination of the instructions convinces us that no injustice was done petitioners by their content. Weighed by the test previously outlined of relation to the military establishments, they are favorable to petitioners' contentions. A few excerpts will make this clear:\n'You are instructed that the term 'national defense' includes all matters directly and reasonably connected with the defense of our nation against its enemies. ... As you will note, the statute specifically mentions the places and things connected with or comprising the first line of defense when it mentions vessels, aircraft, works of defense, fort or battery and torpedo stations. You will note, also, that the statute specifically mentions by name certain other places or things relating to what we may call the secondary line of national defense. Thus some at least of the storage of reserves of men and materials is ordinarily done at naval stations, submarine bases, coaling stations, dock yards, arsenals and camps; and of which are specifically designated in the statute. ... You are instructed in the first place that for purposes of prosecution under these statutes, the information, documents, plans, maps, etc., connected with these places or things must directly relate to the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of said places or things as instruments for defending our nation. ... You are instructed that in the second place the information, documents or notes must relate to those an- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 31]\n\u00a0\n gles or phases of the instrumentality, place or thing which relates to the defense of our nation; thus if a place or thing has one use in peacetime and another use in wartime, you are to distinguish between information relating to the one or the other use. ...\n\n'The information, document or note might also relate to the possession of such information by another nation and as such might also come within the possible scope of this statute. ... For from the standpoint of military or naval strategy it might not only be dangerous to us for a foreign power to know our weaknesses and our limitations, but it might also be dangerous to us when such a foreign power knows that we know that they know of our limitations.\n\n'You are, then, to remember that the information, documents or notes, which are alleged to have been connected with the national defense, may relate or pertain to the usefulness, efficiency or availability of any of the above places, instrumentalities or things for the defense of the United States of America. The connection must not be a strained one nor an arbitrary one. The relationship must be reasonable and direct.'\n\n Petitioners' objection, however, is that after having given these instructions, the court instead of determining whether the reports were or were not connected with national defense, left this question to the jury in these words:\n'Whether or not the information, obtained by any defendant in this case, concerned, regarded or was connected with the national defense is a question of fact solely for the determination of this jury, under these instructions.'\n\n These quotations show that the trial court undertook to give to the jury the tests by which they were to determine whether the acts of the petitioners were connected with or related to the national defense. We are \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 32]\n\u00a0\n of the opinion this was properly left to the jury. If we assume, as we must here after our earlier discussion as to the definiteness of the statute, that the words of the statute are sufficiently specific to advise the ordinary man of its scope, we think it follows that the words of the instructions give adequate definition to 'connected with' or 'relating to' national defense. The inquiry directed at the instructions is whether the jury is given sufficient guidance to enable it to determine whether the acts of the petitioners were within the prohibitions. These instructions set out the definition of national defense in a manner favorable and unobjectionable to petitioners. When they refer to facts connected with or related to defense, however, petitioners urge that the connection should be determined by the court. Instructions can, of course, go no farther than to say the connection must be reasonable, direct and natural. Further elaboration would not clarify. The function of the court is to instruct as to the kind of information which is violative of the statute and of the jury to decide whether the information secured is of the defined kind. It is not the function of the court, where reasonable men may differ, to determine whether the acts do or do not come within the ambit of the statute. The question of the connection of the information with national defense is a question of fact to be determined by the jury as negligence upon undisputed facts is determined. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n In a trial under an indictment for violation of section 317 of this same Espionage Act, this Court had occasion to con- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 19, 33]\n\u00a0\n sider a similar question as to the function of the jury. A pamphlet was introduced as evidence of making false statements with the intent to cause insubordination. To the objection that the pamphlet could not legitimately be construed as tending to produce the prohibited consequences this Court said: 'What interpretation ought to be placed upon the pamphlet, what would be the probable effect of distributing it in the mode adopted, and what were defendants' motives in doing this, were questions for the jury, not the court, to decide. ... Whether the printed words would in fact produce as a proximate result a material interference with the recruiting or enlistment service, or the operation or success of the forces of the United States, was a question for the jury to decide in view of all the circumstances of the time and considering the place and manner of distribution.' \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Viewing the instructions as a whole, we find no objection sufficient to justify reversal.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals properly refused to consider the errors alleged with respect to the conspiracy count. \n19\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217:\n'Title 1.

Cocke, of Norfolk, Va., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, receivers of the Seaboard Air Line Railway Company, seek from the Bituminous Coal Division of the Department of the Interior an exemption of certain coal from the Bituminous Coal Code on the ground that they were both the producer and consumer of the coal. If Seaboard is held to be a producer-consumer, it is entitled to an exemption by virtue of Section 4 part II(l) and Section 4-A. These sections together with others pertinent to the discussion are set out in a note below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 404]\n\u00a0\n The application for exemption was filed before the National Bituminous Coal Commission August 4, 1937. The first hearing was in September 1937 before the examiners for the Commission. After the passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939, 53 Stat. 561, 5 U.S.C.A.  133 et seq., and the acquiescence of Congress in Reorganization Plan No. II, 53 Stat. 1433, 5 U.S.C.A.  133t note, a\n__________ application of the conditions and provisions of the code provided for in section 4, (831-833), or of the provisions of section 4-A, (834), an excise tax in an amount equal to 19 1\/2 per centum of the sale price at the mine in the case of coal disposed of by sale at the mine, or in the case of coal disposed of otherwise than by sale at the mine, and coal sold otherwise than through an arms' length transaction, 19 1\/2 per centum of the fair market value of such coal at the time of such disposal or sale. In the case of any producer who is a code member as provided in section 4 ( 831-833), and is so certified to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Commission, the sale or disposal by such producer during the continuance of his membership in the code of coal produced by him shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this subsection.\n'Sec. 4.

The provisions of this section shall be promulgated by the Commission as the 'Bituminous Coal Code', and are herein referred to as the code.\n\n'Producers accepting membership in the code as provided in section 5 ( 835) (a) shall be, and are herein referred to as, code members, and the provisions of such code shall apply only to such code members, except as otherwise provided by subsection (h) of part II (section 833) of this section.\n\n'For the purpose of carrying out the declared policy of this Act ( subchapter), the code shall contain the following conditions and provisions, which are intended to regulate interstate commerce in bituminous coal (prescribed in sections 832 and 833), and which shall be applicable only to matters and transactions in or directly affecting interstate commerce in bituminous coal:\n\n Part II-Marketing.\n'(s833.)

Order No. 1394, as amended by Order No. 1399 of July 5, 1939, 4 F.R. 2947. Thereafter the hearings proceeded before the Division and the order denying the exemption was passed by the Director, June 14, 1940\n\n\n\n __________ vided, That the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a lawful and bona fide written contract entered into prior to June 16, 1933.\n'(l) The provisions of this section (sections 831, 832 and this section) shall not apply to coal consumed by the producer or to coal transported by the producer to himself for consumption by him.\n\n'Sec. 4-A. ( 834.) Whenever the Commission upon investigation instituted upon its own motion or upon petition of any code member, district board, State or political subdivision thereof, or the consumers' counsel, after hearing finds that transactions in coal in intrastate commerce by any person or in any locality cause any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons and localities in such commerce on the one hand and interstate commerce in coal on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate commerce in coal, or in any manner directly affect interstate commerce in coal, the Commission shall by order so declare and thereafter coal sold, delivered or offered for sale in such intrastate commerce shall be subject to the provisions of section 4 (831, 832 and 833).\n\n'Any producer believing that any commerce in coal is not subject to the provisions of section 4 (831, 832 and 833), ... may file with the Commission an application, verified by oath or affirmation for exemption, setting forth the facts upon which such claim is based. ... Within a reasonable time after the receipt of any application for exemption the Commission shall enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of such application. ... Any applicant aggrieved by an order denying or otherwise disposing of an application for exemption by the Commission may obtain a review of such order in the manner provided in subsection (b) of section 6 (836).\n\n'Sec. 6.

Subsequently Seaboard sought review under Section 6(b) and obtained the decree, now under consideration, reversing the Director's order. The opinion accompanying the decree held that the facts of this case brought the Seaboard under the classification of producer. 4 Cir., 114 F.2d 752. As the question of federal law was important2 and unsettled by any decision of this Court, certiorari was granted, J.C.  240(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  347(a), \n311 \nU.S. 644\n, 61 S.Ct. 442, and the decree below affirmed by an equally divided Court, \n312 \nU.S. 666\n, 61 S.Ct. 824. The present consideration is upon a petition for rehearing. \n313 \nU.S. 596\n, 61 S.Ct. 938.\n\n Seaboard, a coal-burning railroad, is a large consumer of bituminous coal. The arrangements here in question \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 407]\n\u00a0\n are with three mines but as there are no significant difference in the plans by which the coal is extracted, we shall describe the contracts relating to one only, the William-Ann Mine, owned by the United Thacker Coal Company and the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust.\n This was the earliest arrangement. It originated in May, 1934, when the coal code of the National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 195, was in effect. \n3\n The first step was a lease of coal lands by the Seaboard from the landowners which granted to Seaboard the right to mine coal for fourteen months with the privilege of yearly renewals which originally were not to run beyond June 30, 1939. Successive extensions have continued its effect since that time. During the spring of 1936 two extensions of six weeks each were agreed upon, specifically in view of the case of Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, decided May 18, 1936. The Carter case involved the Bituminous Coal Act of 1935, 15 U.S.C.A.  801 et seq., the predecessor of the present act. A per ton royalty, as rent, was reserved to the landowners with an annual minimum of $16,200 payable quarterly. The lease was terminable on fifteen days notice, if the landowners terminated the contractor's lease, about to be referred to, for the contractor's default.\n The second step in this arrangement was for the landowner lessors of the lease just described to lease simultaneously to a contractor selected by Seaboard the mining equipment on the demised premises consisting of buildings, tipples, machinery and other appurtenances necessary or convenient for extracting the coal. This equipment was sufficient for reasonably economical mining. It was further provided in the coal lease that the term and \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 408]\n\u00a0\n the renewal privileges of the equipment lease should be coextensive with those of the coal lease.\n The final step was an operating contract between the contractor, Daniel H. Pritchard, referred to in the land lease as the lessee of the facilities for mining, and Seaboard for the extraction of the coal by the contractor or supplier and the delivery of it to Seaboard for consumption. This contract also was made simultaneously with the coal lease. It contained a provision requiring the contractor to obtain a lease of the mining equipment in accordance with that segment of the entire plan referred to in the preceding paragraph. For a flat per ton cost on a sliding scale dependent upon volume, the supplier agreed to mine the coal. His compensation was subject to variation by fluctuations in costs beyond his control such as taxes, wages, machinery and explosives. Alternatively, payment could be made on a cost basis plus ten cents per ton for the contractor's compensation. This operating contract ran for the same term and had the same renewal privileges as the coal lease contract heretofore described and has been continued in effect by extensions made for the same terms as the extensions of the coal lease. The supplier was called an independent contractor in the document. This he was, at least in the sense that he managed the mining in his own way without a right of direction in Seaboard. He agreed that the coal supplied would be clean, i.e., free of non-combustible matter, and would pass inspection of Seaboard for compliance with its specifications. The supplier paid and assumed all obligations to the landowner except the royalty, including taxes. He carried employer's liability and casualty insurance, and agreed to bear the cost of all repairs, additions or betterments even under the alternate cost plus plan, as well as those described as commissary or welfare expenses. Seaboard, in an extension agreement, obtained the privilege of termination on sixty days' notice, if the supplier \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 409]\n\u00a0\n defaulted by not lowering his contract price to meet the market price of similar coal.\n The landowner, the contractor and Seaboard by this series of coordinated and synchronized contracts caused the entire output of the mine to be delivered to Seaboard for its consumption at a fixed price, subject to variations for factors beyond the supplier contractor's control. The alternative cost-plus plan was not employed. Under the contractor's agreement, the contractor assumed all risks of operation, as heretofore explained, and all obligations of Seaboard to the landowner except the royalty payments. This made a fixed cost to Seaboard for coal of supplier's contract price plus the royalty per ton as rent. It was a short term, one year, contract with the price controlled by the market in view of the competitive price provision. Seaboard furnished no facilities or equipment for mining or loading.\n The other two arrangements, one with the Glamorgan Coal Lands Corporation, landowner, and Glamorgan Coals, Inc., the operator, for which latter corporation Peerless Coal Corporation is substituted by consent, and the other with Chilton Block Coal Company and the Dingess-Rum Coal Company, landowners by lease and in fee, and Daniel H. Pritchard, operator, vary only in details from the William-Ann contracts set out above.\n From the several arrangements the Seaboard obtained about half of its annual requirements estimated for 1936 at one million tons. There is no question as to the interstate character of the commerce involved. The coal is mined in Virginia and West Virginia and consumed in a number of other South Atlantic states.\n The Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 followed the invalidation of the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 by Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, and the abandonment of the N.R.A. Code of Fair Competition after the decision in Schechter Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 410]\n\u00a0\n 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947. These legislative enactments sought a solution of the economic difficulties of the soft coal industry, which were bringing bankruptcy to operators and an even worse condition, unemployment, to the miners. Each time legislation was attempted, the conclusion was reached that price stabilization offered the best remedy. The industry found the same answer. Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S.Ct. 471. This Court has determined that the present 1937 act is within the constitutional powers of Congress. Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907.\n This purpose of stabilization of conditions through a fixed price scheme met a difficult problem in the captive coal mines. The 1935 act taxed the value of such coal at the mine. It defined captive coal as including 'all coal produced at a mine for consumption by the producer or by a subsidiary or affiliate thereof.' 49 Stat. 1008. As the coal consumed by a producer apparently was deemed by Congress when considering the present act not to offer the same disturbing effect to prices as noncode, open market coal,4 a method of exemption was provided. Sections 4, part II( l) and 4-A, note 1, supra. Congress, however, did not define exempt coal as it had captive coal in the 1935 act. While a definition was inserted in the Senate5 it \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 411]\n\u00a0\n was eliminated in the conference report. \n6\n As a result the determination of exempt coal was left to the administrative body. Section 4-A, note 1, supra.\n Determination of Producer. We are thus brought squarely to decide whether the Director's finding that Seaboard is not the producer of this coal is to be sustained. By Section 4-A, note 1, supra, the determination of this issue rests with the Director, subject to the review, as obtained herein, by a Circuit Court of Appeals, provided by Section 6(b). Section 4- A states: 'Any producer believing that any commerce in coal is not subject to the provisions of section 4 (831, 832, and 833) ... may file with the Commission an application, verified by oath or affirmation for exemption, setting forth the facts upon which such claim is based. ... Within a reasonable time after the receipt of any application for exemption the Commission shall enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of such application.' In a matter left specifically by Congress to the determination of an administrative body, as the question of exemption was here by Sections 4, part II(l) and 4-A, the function of review placed upon the courts by Section 6(b) is fully performed when they determine that there has been a fair hearing, with notice and an opportunity to present the circumstances and arguments to the decisive body, and an application of the statute in a just and reasoned manner. Shields v. Utah Idaho R. Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177, 180\n, 181 S., 184, 185, 187, 59 S.Ct. 160, 162, 164, 165.\n Such a determination as is here involved belongs to the usual administrative routine. Congress, which could have \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 412]\n\u00a0\n legislated specifically as to the individual exemptions from the code, found it more efficient to delegate that function to those whose experience in a particular field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable adjustment of the conflicting interests of price stabilization upon the one hand and producer consumption upon the other. By thus committing the execution of its policies to the specialized personnel of the Bituminous Coal Division, the Congress followed a familiar practice. 7 Of course, there is no difference between the skill of employees in a division of a department and those in a board, commission or administration.\n Where as here a determination has been left to an administrative body, this delegation will be respected and the administrative conclusion left untouched. Certainly a finding on Congressional reference that an admittedly constitutional act is applicable to a particular situation does not require such further scrutiny. Although we have here no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, that does not permit a court to substitute its judgment for that of the Director. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S.Ct. 113, 114; Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd., v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297, 304\n, 57 S.Ct. 478, 481; Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331, 336\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, 557. It is not the province of a court to absorb the administrative functions to such an extent that the executive or legislative agencies become mere fact finding bodies deprived of the advantages of prompt and definite action.\n Congress could not 'define the whole gamut of remedies to effectuate these policies in an infinite variety of specific situations.' Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 194\n, 61 S.Ct. 845, 852, 133 A.L.R. 1217. Just as in the Adkins case the determination of the sweep of the term 'bituminous \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 413]\n\u00a0\n coal' was for this same administrative agency, so here there must be left to it, subject to the basic prerequisites of lawful adjudication, the determination of 'producer.' The separation of production and consumption is complete when a buyer obtains supplies from a seller totally free from buyer connection. Their identity is undoubted when the consumer extracts coal from its own land with its own employees. Between the two extremes are the innumerable variations that bring the arrangements closer to one pole or the other of the range between exemption and inclusion. To determine upon which side of the median line the particular instance falls calls for the expert, experienced judgment of those familiar with the industry. Unless we can say that a set of circumstances deemed by the Commission to bring them within the concept 'producer' is so unrelated to the tasks entrusted by Congress to the Commission as in effect to deny a sensible exercise of judgment, it is the Court's duty to leave the Commission's judgment undisturbed.\n Consumers of bituminous coal are naturally desirous of obtaining supplies free of the tax and free of the risk and investment typical of production. If independent contractors are employed for extraction, there is an obvious breach in the full consumer-producer identity. This may create consequences which would not follow if the enterprise itself, through its own employees, accomplished the same ultimate result. Often in the law, the selection of a particular business form as, for instance, carrying on a common business through two corporations, may create legal liability, Edwards v. Chile Copper Company, \n270 \nU.S. 452, 456\n, 46 S.Ct. 345, 346, although such relation to other connections may result in diversity of legal treatment. Compare, for instance, United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366\n, 29 S.Ct. 527, and United States v. Delaware, Lack. & West. R.R., \n238 \nU.S. 516\n, 35 S.Ct. 873. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 414]\n\u00a0\n The shortness of the leases, the freedom from investment in coal lands or mining facilities, the improbability of profit or loss from the mining operations, the right to cancel when cheaper coal may be obtained in the open market, all deny the position of producer to the railroad.\n We view it as immaterial that the Company might have itself operated a captive mine and so escaped the price provisions of the act by virtue of the exception of Section 4, part II(l), note 1, supra. It chose to employ the scheme in question here. It considered it advantageous to avoid the risks of production and now must bear the burdens of a determination that other entities than itself are the producers. Cf. Superior Coal Co. v. Department of Finance, 377 Ill. 282, 36 N.E.2d 354, 358, 360. The choice of disregarding a deliberately chosen arrangement for conducting business affairs does not lie with the creator of the plan. Higgins v. Smith, \n308 \nU.S. 473, 477\n, 60 S.Ct. 355, 357.\n Code Coverage. Seaboard contends that the coal here involved is not affected by the code Section 4, part II because there is no sale or other transfer of the title to the coal by the producer. As to this point, in Seaboard's view, since it as lessee of the mineral rights is the owner of the coal when it is extracted and until it is consumed and therefore no title ever passes, it is immaterial whether or not it or its suppliers of the coal are determined to be the producer. Support for the conclusion that there must be a transfer of title to bring the coal under the Code, Section 4, part II, is found by Seaboard in the preoccupation of Congress in sales, which attitude it feels is shown by the continuous reference in the provisions of the Act to sales or other transfers of title. Further support is drawn for the position by reference to Section 3(a), where 'disposal' is declared to include consumption by a producer or any transfer of title other than by sale. Reliance is placed also on Section 3( b), which by a tax of 19 1\/2 per cent of the selling price impels adherence to the code when coal 'which would be subject \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 415]\n\u00a0\n to the application of the conditions and provisions of the code provided for in section 4 (831-833), or of the provisions of section 4-A (834)' is sold or otherwise disposed of by the producer.\n Had we held that Seaboard was the producer, the pertinency of this argument would disappear because Seaboard would be both producer and consumer and therefore this coal would be entitled to exemption under Sections 4, part II(l) and 4-A. As we determine otherwise, however, it is essential to examine the soundness of the position asserted by Seaboard, to wit, that coal produced by the instrumentalities is not subject to the provisions of Section 4, part II for the reason that it is not sold not otherwise disposed of by the producers. We conclude that coal extracted under the circumstances of this case is within the scope of the code provisions of Section 4, part II.\n Examination of the code discloses that minimum prices for code coal are fixed by joint action of the district boards and the Director. Section 4, parts I(a), II(a). Thereafter no code coal may be sold at prices less than the fixed minimum except at the risk of severe penalties. Code coal is that produced by code members, i.e., coal producers who accept membership in the code. Section 5(a). All producers of bituminous coal within the statutory districts are eligible for membership, and therefore all coal produced by any of these producers is potentially code coal. The code regulates the coal and not the producer. In order to force the eligible coal within the code, an excise tax of 19 1\/2% of the sale price is placed upon all bituminous coal 'sold or otherwise disposed of by the producer thereof, which would be subject to the application of the conditions and provisions of the code' with a blanket exemption from this tax of sales or other disposal by code members.\n The core of the Act is the requirement that coal be put under the code or pay the 19 1\/2 per cent exercise. We said in Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381, 392\n, 60 S.Ct. 907, 912, that the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 416]\n\u00a0\n sanction tax applied to non-code members. Since they were not members, it was there contended that their coal would not be subject to the code, but it was explained in the Adkins case that the code was intended to apply to sales 'in or directly affecting interstate commerce in bituminous coal,' Section 4, 3rd paragraph, and that non-code coal 'would be' subject to the code when it was interstate coal or coal affecting interstate commerce and therefore subject to the regulatory power of Congress. So here, the purpose of Congress which was to stabilize the industry through price regulation, would be hampered by an interpretation that required a transfer of title, in the technical sense, to bring a producer's coal, consumed by another party, within the ambit of the coal code. We find no necessity to so interpret the act. This conclusion seems to us in accord with the plain language of Section 3(a) and (b) providing for a tax on 'other disposal' as well as sale. The definition of disposal as including 'consumption or use ... by a producer, and any transfer of title by the producer other than by sale' cannot be said to put a meaning on disposal limited to the inclusion. Cf. Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., \n314 \nU.S. 95\n, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. --, decided November 10, 1941, and cases cited page 3 of slip opinion (62 S.Ct. 3, 4). It is true that Section 4, part II(e) speaks of a violation of the price provisions by 'sale or delivery or offer for sale of coal at a price below' the minimum without reference to 'other disposition,' the phrase generally used, but the failure to include those words at that point does not, we think, justify an interpretation that coal covered by the code may be disposed of otherwise than by a transfer of title without penalty. We think the language of Section 5(b) relating to findings on orders punishing for violation of the code shows this to be true. It reads so far as pertinent as follows: '... the Commission shall specifically find ... the quantity of coal sold or otherwise disposed of in violation of the code ...; the sales price at the mine or the market value at the mine if disposed of otherwise than by sale at \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 417]\n\u00a0\n the mine, or if sold otherwise than through an arms' length transaction, of the coal sold or otherwise disposed of by such code member in violation of the code or regulations thereunder.' 50 Stat. 84.\n This conclusion is fortified by an examination of the tax section of the 1935 act from which the present Section 3 is obviously derived. In the first or 1935 act captive coal was taxed along with other coal. The tax was laid upon the 'sale or other disposal of all bituminous coal produced within the United States.' It was '15 per centum on the sale price at the mine, or in the case of captive coal the fair market value of such coal at the mine.' 49 Stat. 993,  3. Evidently the draftsman thought of the sale of free coal and of the 'other disposal' of captive coal. See further, on the question of the meaning of a sale, In re Bush Terminal Co., 2 Cir., 93 F.2d 661, 663.\n Finally respondent contends that if the act is construed to apply to the contractual arrangements just considered it is beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution. This is said to be so because there is no power in Congress to regulate the price paid for the service of mining coal or the consideration for mining rights and to do so would violate the Fifth Amendment. We are in this review by certiorari determining only the question of whether the Seaboard is a producer under the act. Congressional power over that problem is beyond dispute. Currin v.

Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n I think the judgment should be affirmed. There are limits to which administrative officers and courts may ap- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 418]\n\u00a0\n propriately go in reconstructing a statute so as to accomplish aims which the legislature might have had but which the statute itself, and its legislative history, do not disclose. The present decision, it seems to me, passes that limitation.\n The case involves an Act of Congress which, in implementing its declared purpose and intent, carefully delimits by inclusive and exclusive definition those who shall and those who shall not be subject to its regulatory provisions. Upon a record in which there is not a single disputed fact, the bare question is presented whether the words the Congress used bring the respondents within the Bituminous Coal Code or exclude them from its operation. In answering that question the Director made no controverted finding of fact, exercised no judgment as to what the relevant circumstances were, but merely decided that the meaning of the statute was that the respondents' transactions required that they become members of the Code or suffer the penalty of the 19 1\/2% tax for failing to join the Code. If the Director was in error his error was a misconstruction of the Act which created his office and that error, under all relevant authorities, is subject to court review. It is specifically made so subject to review by the statute in question. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Bituminous Coal Act, as its preamble declares, is aimed at the regulation of prices and unfair methods of competition in the marketing of bituminous coal in interstate commerce2 as the means of promoting that commerce and relieving it from practices and methods which burden and obstruct it. The body of the Act is confined to the enforcement of these purposes and none other.\n To accomplish the declared end, the statute adopts a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of prices and \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 419]\n\u00a0\n trade practices in the marketing of bituminous coal in interstate commerce. It creates a Commission and, by  4, directs the Commission to promulgate a Bituminous Coal Code to which coal producers who are 'code members' are made subject. By Part II of  4 the Commission is given authority to fix minimum and maximum prices for code members in conformity to specified standards. Subdivision (i) of  4, Part II, specifies methods of competition in the marketing of coal which are declared to be unfair and violations of the Code.\n Section 3(a) imposes a tax of 1% per ton on all coal 'sold or otherwise disposed of by the producer' and defines disposal, for the purposes of this section alone, as including 'consumption or use' by a producer and any transfer of title by a producer other than by sale. The acknowledged purpose of this subsection is the levy on all coal taken out of the ground, and used by whomsoever, of a small tax to pay the expense of the administration of the Act. The respondents admit their liability for this exaction. They have paid this tax and no question arises in respect of it.\n Section 3(b), as a means of securing compliance with the regulatory provisions of  4, imposes a penal tax of 19 1\/2% of the sale price of the coal, or of its fair market value when disposed of otherwise than by a sale, on all the coal sold or otherwise disposed of by a producer to whom the regulatory provisions as to price and unfair methods of competition included in  4 are applicable. Only those who are producers of coal and would be subject to the provisions of the Code are liable to the penalty tax as an alternative to joining the Code and thus coming within the regulatory provisions applicable to such Code members. Such regulatory provisions are concerned only with those who sell or market coal.\n Subdivision (l) of Part II of  4 declares: 'The provisions of this section (831, 832 and this section) shall not apply to coal consumed by the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 420]\n\u00a0\n producer or to coal transported by the producer to himself for consumption by him.' The respondents insist that this subsection plainly exempts them from becoming members of the Code and that, in pursuance of the subsection, the Director should have granted their application for exemption.\n Some stress is laid by the petitioners on  17(c) which declares that:\n'As used in this Act (subchapter)-\n\n'(c) The term 'producer' includes all individuals, firms, associations, corporations, trustees, and receivers engaged in the business of mining coal.'\n\n It seems plain enough that this provision was not intended to nullify subsection (l) of  4, Part II. The evident purpose was to make it clear that, under whatever form the business was done, the operator should come under the applicable provisions of the statute. This subsection has no relevance to the question presented in this case.\n The term 'producer' is not a technical term or a term of art, but the statute has not left the Director or the courts without guides respecting the meaning of the word as used in the statute. It is the Director's duty to observe those guides in applying the statute and, if he fails so to do, it is the obligation of the courts to observe them in performing their statutory duty to review his determination. The context, the purposes of the Act, and the means adopted to carry them into effect, make clear the meaning of the word 'producer' as used in the statute. This court obviously fails in performing its duty and abdicates its function as a court of review if it accepts, as the opinion seems to do, the Director's definition of 'producer' and then proceeds to accommodate the meaning of related provisions to the predetermined definition. So to do is a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 421]\n\u00a0\n complete reversal of the normal and usual method of construing a statute.\n The legislative history3 demonstrates, and the opinion of the court concedes, that the purpose of  4 (Pt. II(l)) was to exclude from the provisions of the Act regulating prices and other matters of competition in interstate marketing, coal produced from 'captive mines'; that is, coal produced by the owner of a mine and consumed by him without placing it on the market. It is, as it must be, also conceded that subdivision (l) excludes from the operation of the Act one who mines coal by his own employes, upon land owned or leased by him, and consumes it in his business or industry. The only possible differentiation between the respondents' method of conducting the business and that of the usual captive mine lies in the fact that the respondents' coal is mined by an independent contractor instead of by employes. That circumstance, however, will not justify the statement that respondents do not produce the coal any more than it would justify the statement that they would not transport coal to themselves, within the meaning of the Act, if they shipped it by a common carrier who was an independent contractor. The circumstance that the coal is mined by a contractor instead of an employe, or transported by a common carrier, cannot have any more, or any different, effect upon the subjects of regulation,-prices and unfair methods of competiton-in the one case than in the other. In both cases the owner would consume coal which would otherwise come on the market. In neither case would the coal be brought into competition with marketed coal. In each case the owner would remain free to buy coal on the market whenever the market price fell below the cost of production at his own mine. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 422]\n\u00a0\n Subdivision (l) cannot appropriately be construed to deny respondents the right to be excluded from the operation of the Act upon their application as provided in  4-A when there are plainly no affirmative provisions of the Act subjecting them to its regulation. It will hardly be denied that, by respondents' total operation, coal is produced. If they are not the producers, because they pay a contract price instead of wages for its production, they are not subject to the 19 1\/2% tax which applies only to producers; and they are thus exempt from the only sanction which would compel them to become Code members subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act. Since they market no coal, the provisions of  4 relating to prices and methods of competition in the marketing of coal are not applicable to them. On the other hand, if the independent contractor whom respondents employ to mine the coal is deemed the producer of the coal, he likewise is exempt from the regulatory provisions and also exempt from the 19 1\/2% penal tax. For, even if he be called a producer, he neither markets nor sells the coal and he cannot be said to dispose of coal which he does not own. Disposal must mean something more than physical production, delivery, or transportation of the coal of another. If it were otherwise, the superintendent of a captive mine would be subject to the tax because he is engaged in mining coal and delivering it to the owner who consumes it. It is well known that in many coal fields coal is gotten out by employing a miner who in turn employs his own gang to assist him in the mine. If the Director's position is correct, this method of operation would subject the owner and operator of a captive mine to regulation under the Act. That view would be plainly untenable.\n The vice in the construction which the court now adopts, apparently only because the Director has adopted it, lies in the fact that this construction is of practical significance \n\n[314 \nU.S. 402, 423]\n\u00a0\n only as it is preliminary to regulation of features of the coal industry other than prices and methods of competition in the marketing of coal. Congress has not seen fit to prescribe such regulation. It is clear that the attempted subjection of respondents to the control of the Commission is without congressional authority.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BYRNES join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 72, 15 U.S.C.  828 et seq.

Bailey, Jr., both of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Carl B. Callaway, of Dallas, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action, begun in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, by the personal representatives substituted for the heirs at law of Colonel Robert D. Gordon, who died a citizen and resident of Texas, against the Prudential Insurance Company of America to collect an insurance policy on the life of the decedent. The Company filed a bill of interpleader, 49 Stat. 1096, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(26), making the respondent John D. McCoach, Trustee, and other alleged claimants parties and tendering the net amount due under the policy. The interpleader was allowed, the Company discharged from the litigation and the interests of all parties to the suit other than petitioner and respondent disposed of by the decree in a manner to which no one objects here. The controversy still to be decided is as to whether the estate \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n or the Trustee is entitled to certain portions of the insurance. The circumstances giving rise to the issue follow.\n Colonel Gordon, the insured, interested seven persons in Texas oil developments, including McCoach, the Trustee, in his individual capacity. They operated as a New York common law association called the Middleton Tex Oil Syndicate. The record here shows that 'Prior to the issuing of the policy and thereafter, the members advanced considerable money to Gordon, and the premiums on the policy were paid by the members of the syndicate at Gordon's request, upon his agreement to repay the syndicate. Premiums were paid on the policy by the syndicate, in accordance with this agreement and were never repaid by Gordon.' A term insurance policy was taken out by Gordon with the Syndicate named as beneficiary. When the policy was issued, and at all times subsequent until his death, Gordon was a citizen of Texas. The Syndicate originally had physical possession of the policy. Two years after its issuance the Syndicate ceased operations. In 1924 due to financial reverses it ceased to do business and the members formed a new association called the Protection Syndicate. McCoach became and continues as Trustee of the Syndicate. It was organized 'for the sole purpose' of paying the premiums on the policy and receiving and distributing the proceeds among the members. This it did until the insured's death. The beneficiary in the policy was changed to make the members of the Protection Syndicate the beneficiaries. By arrangement between the decedent and the members of the Protection Syndicate in 1934 a further change of beneficiaries was made by which, in consideration of the insured's release of the right to change beneficiaries on presentation of the policy for endorsement, hitherto retained, one-eighth of the disability proceeds of the policy were to be paid the insured and one- eighth of the death proceeds to his wife and the remaining seven-eighths to the Trustee for the members of the Protection Syndicate. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n 'The application for the policy was signed by Gordon in the State of New York, and forwarded to the home office of th Prudential Insurance Company in the State of New Jersey, and there acted upon, and the policy was delivered in the State of New York.' The later arrangement by which Gordon and his wife became beneficiaries of one-eighth of the proceeds was consummated by certain forms furnished by the Prudential and 'transmitted ... from Middletown, N.Y., to Tyler, Texas, for Colonel Gordon's signature. They were there executed by Colonel Gordon before a notary public in Tyler, Texas, and returned to Middletown, N.Y., where they were executed by the parties residing there, from whence they were sent by Schweiger (an agent of the Prudential and a member of the Syndicate), with the policy, to the home office at Newark, N.J., and subsequently the forms were indorsed on the policy and it was returned directly from New Jersey to the beneficiaries in New York.'\n Thereafter three of the members of the Protection Syndicate separately assigned their interest in the policy to three individuals not previously interested in the transaction. These assignees paid their proportion of the premiums after the respective assignments.\n The District Court decreed that Mrs. Gordon should receive her one- eighth and that the balance of the proceeds should be paid the Trustee for the benefit of the cross-defendants, members of the Protection Syndicate. The decree was based on a finding that the policy was a New York contract and that the subsequent changes were made in New Jersey and delivered in New York. Further the District Court concluded that the relation of debtor and creditor existed between the members of the Syndicate and their assignees upon the one hand and the insured upon the other and that therefore all the cestuis que trustent had an insurable interest in Colonel Gordon's life. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n An appeal limited to the 'correctness of the judgment of the trial court concerning the persons entitled to receive the assigned interests' was prosecuted on an agreed statement of the record under Rule 76 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. In the statement petitioner sets out two points now relied upon for reversal. First: That the assignment and change of beneficiary was governed by the law of Texas; that the Trustee claimed only under the assignment; that beneficiaries must have an insurable interest under Texas law and that the assignees had none. Hence the personal representative was entitled to recover their portions of the policy for the estate. Wilke v. Finn, Tex. Com.App., 39 S.W.2d 836. Second: That if the whole transaction was governed by the law of another state than Texas, in which other state an insurable interest was not required, the United States District Court sitting in Texas was bound by the public policy of Texas which forbids persons without an insurable interest to collect in Texas, as beneficiaries, the proceeds of insurance policies.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 5 Cir., 116 F.2d 261. It held too that the policy was a New York policy, governed by the law of that state, and that as the subsequent changes were made pursuant to agreements contained in the original policy, they did not amount to new contracts or change the governing law. Cf. Aetna Life Insurance Company v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389\n, 45 S.Ct. 129. The Court said: 'Under the terms of the policy, a New York contract, no restrictions were placed upon assignments relating to insurable interest. None was created by the laws of New York. Each of the assignments was executed and delivered in New York by residents of that state to other residents. They were New York contracts and valid under its laws. To apply the laws of Texas to the New York contracts would constitute an unwarranted extraterritorial control of contracts and regulation of business out- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n side of Texas in disregard of the laws of New York; this is not changed by the trial of the suit in a court sitting in Texas.' (116 F.2d 264.)\n As to the violation of the claimed public policy of Texas  against beneficiaries with non-insurable interests, the Court of Appeals decided that the rule could not be applied where, as here, a 'fair and proper insurable interest' existed when the policy was issued. 116 F.2d 261, 264. Certiorari was sought and allowed, \n312 \nU.S. 676\n, 61 S.Ct. 807, 85 L.Ed. --, on the ground among others of a conflict between the instant case and Sampson v. Channell, 110 F.2d 754, 759, 762, 128 A.L.R. 394, where the First Circuit held that a United States court must apply the conflict of laws rules of the state where it sits.\n For the reasons given in Klaxon Company v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Company, \n313 \nU.S. 487\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. --, decided today, we are of the view that the federal courts in diversity of citizenship cases are governed by the conflict of laws rules of the courts of the states in which they sit. In deciding that the changes made in the insurance contract left its governing law unaffected1 and that the laws of Texas could not be applied to a foreign contract in Texas courts,2 the federal courts were applying rules of law in a way which may or may not have been consistent with Texas decisions. Likewise it is for Texas to say whether its public policy permits a beneficiary of an insurance policy on the life of a Texas citizen to recover where no insurable interest in the decedent exists in the beneficiary. The opinion does not rest its conclusions upon its appraisal of Texas law or Texas decisions but upon decisions of this Court inapplicable to this situation in the light of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A. L.R. 1487, and Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Company, \n304 \nU.S. 202, 205\n, 58 S.Ct. 860, 861.3 The statement in the opinion 'that it is im- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n material, in so far as the decision of this case is concerned, whether the law of Texas or the law of New York be applied' we understand, from a reading of the whole opinion, to mean that while an insurable interest is required in Texas and not in New York, the lack of insurable interest is immaterial in this case even in Texas because 'the insurer acknowledged liability and paid the money into court. This being so, not only does the objection of wagers disappear, but also the claimed principle of public policy.' But this is something to be decided according to Texas decisions to none of which the opinion refers. Cf. Wilke v. Finn, Tex.Civ.App., 39 S. W.2d 836; Cheeves v. Anders, 87 Tex. 287, 28 S.W. 274, 47 Am.St.Rep. 107. The decision must be reversed and remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for determination of the law of Texas as applied to the circumstances of this case.\n In view of the holding quoted from the opinion below, page 3, (61 S. Ct. p. 1025) supra, that to apply the laws of Texas to New York contracts when Texas citizens were parties would constitute an unwarranted extraterritorial control of contracts and regulation of business, it seems necessary to examine that position as it may be determined upon remand that these are foreign contracts and under Texas law unenforceable as contrary to the public policy of Texas because the assignees have no insurable interest. It would then be necessary to decide whether the courts of Texas could constitutionally apply Texas law to a foreign contract, valid where made, because such contract is contrary to the state's public policy. \n4\n If the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in its view that the Constitution foreclosed application of such a Texas public policy to this case, the only question open on remand would be whether the contract sued upon was a Texas contract.\n But the cases relied upon in the Court of Appeals to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n support its holding5 do not in our opinion decide this question. Overby v. Gordon holds that the adjudication of a probate court of Georgia that the decedent was a resident of that state was a proceeding in rem and did not bind the courts of the District of Columbia in a suit to determine anew decedent's domicile. New York Life Insurance Company v. Head passed upon the application, by Missouri courts, of Missouri statutes providing for an extention of insurance on default of premium to an insurance contract assumed as of Missouri, though the insured at the time of issue and thereafter was a citizen of New Mexico. A New York loan agreement subsequent to the issuance of the policy between the insured and the Company, a citizen of New York, provided for extension after default which was contrary to the Missouri statutes. This Court held the Missouri statutes were ineffective because the New York loan agreement was beyond Missouri's jurisdiction. The point that Missouri might refuse enforcement because the agreement, valid in New York, was contrary to the public policy of the former was not discussed. In Bond v. Hume, a few years later, this Court reserved the principle here in question. \n6\n The Aetna case denied the constitutional power of the Texas courts to apply a Texas statute allowing a penalty and attorneys' fees against the company in a suit on an insurance contract made in a foreign jurisdiction with a person then a citizen of Tennessee because \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n the 'effect of such application would be to regulate business outside the state of Texas and control contracts made by citizens of other states in disregard of their laws under which penalties and attorney's fees are not recoverable.' 266 U.S. at 399, 45 S.Ct. at 132. The freedom from penalty and fee was deemed a part of the foreign contract and its effect on the public policy of Texas was not appraised. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n If upon examination of the Texas law it appears that the courts of Texas would refuse enforcement of an insurance contract where the beneficiaries have no insurable interest on the ground of its interference with local law, such refusal would be, in our opinion, within the constitutional power of the Texas courts. Rights acquired by contract outside a state are enforced within a state, certainly where its own citizens are concerned, but that principle excepts claimed rights so contrary to the law of the forum as to subvert the forum's view of public policy. Cf. Loucks v. Standard Oil Co., 224 N.Y. 99, 110, 120 N.E. 198. It is 'rudimentary' that a state 'will not lend the aid of its courts to enforce a contract founded upon a foreign law where to do so would be repugnant to good morals, would lead to disturbance and disorganization of the local municipal law, or, in other words, vi late the public policy of the state where the enforcement of the foreign contract is sought.' Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 37 S.Ct. 366, 368. Applying that reasoning this Court affirmed the federal court in following Texas' decisions which refused to enforce a valid foreign contract of guarantyship against a married woman. Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412\n, 38 S.Ct. 147. Likewise state courts have been upheld in refusing to lend their aid to enforce \n\n[313 \nU.S. 498, 507]\n\u00a0\n valid foreign contracts which required the doing of prohibited acts within the state of the forum. Bothwell v. Buckbee-Mears Company, \n275 \nU.S. 274, 278\n, 48 S.Ct. 124, 125. Where this Court has required the state of the forum to apply the foreign law under the full faith and credit clause or under the Fourteenth Amendment it has recognized that a state is not required to enforce a law obnoxious to its public policy. Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 160\n, 161 S., 52 S.Ct. 571, 576, 82 A.L.R. 696; Hartford Indemnity Co. v. Delta Co., \n292 \nU.S. 143, 150\n, 54 S.Ct. 634, 636, 92 A.L.R. 928. The rule was not applied where the parties to the contract acquired rights beyond the state's borders with no relation to anything done or to be done within the borders. Home Insurance Company v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 410\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 342, 74 A.L.R. 701.\n In the Head case the foreign and local law differed as to the manner of extending insurance; in the Aetna case the difference arose from a local provision for attorney's fees and penalty; in the Delta case the time for notice varied in the two jurisdictions. In New York Life Insurance Company v. Dodge, \n246 \nU.S. 357\n, 38 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas.1918E, 593, it was said that a statute of the state of the forum, regulating the application of insurance reserves in case of default of premium was not effective, even while the insurance contract was a local contract and the insured a citizen of the state, to govern rights under a loan agreement made in a foreign jurisdiction. But these fall short of a public policy which protects citizens against the assumed dangers of insurance on their lives held by strangers. It is for the state to say whether a contract contrary to such a statute or rule of law is so offensive to its view of public welfare as to require its courts to close their doors to its enforcement.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

Barringer, Jr., both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n It is provided in the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 248, that for gift-tax purposes the amount of a gift of property shall be 'the value thereof at the date of the gift.'  506, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  1005. This controversy involves the question of whether such 'value' in case of single-premium life insurance policies, which are irrevocably assigned simultaneously with issuance, is cost to the donor or cash-surrender value of the policies. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted because of a conflict among the Circuit Courts of Appeals1 as respects the proper method for valuation of such gifts made prior to 1936. 2 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 254, 256]\n\u00a0\n In December, 1934, petitioner purchased, at a cost of $852,438.50, single-premium life insurance policies on her own life in the aggregate face amount of $1,000,000. At substantially the same time she assigned them irrevocably to three of her children. Her gift-tax return listed the policies at their asserted cash-surrender value3 of $717,344.81. The Commissioner determined that the 'value' of the policies was their cost and assessed a deficiency which petitioner paid. This is a suit for a refund. Judgment for petitioner in the District Court, 28 F.Supp. 322, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 Cir., 110 F.2d 371.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that cost rather than cash- surrender value is the proper criterion for valuation of such gifts under  506 of the Act.\n Cash-surrender value is the reserve less a surrender charge. And in case of a single-premium policy the reserve is the face amount of the contract discounted at a specified rate of interest on the basis of the insured's expected life. If the policy is surrendered, the company will pay the cash-surrender value. It is asserted that the market for insurance contracts is usually he issuing companies or the banks who will lend money on them; that banks will not loan more than the cash-surrender value; and that if policies had an actual realizable value in excess of their cash- surrender value, there would arise a business of purchasing such policies from those who otherwise would surrender them. From these facts it is urged that cash-surrender value represents the amount which would be actually obtained for the policies in a willing buyer-willing seller market-the test suggested \n\n[312 \nU.S. 254, 257]\n\u00a0\n by Treasury Regulations 79, Art. 19(1), promulgated October 30, 1933.4\n That analysis, however, overlooks the nature of the property interest which is being valued. Surrender of a policy represents only one of the rights of the insured or beneficiary. Plainly that right is one of the substantial legal incidents of ownership. See Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327, 335\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 127, 63 A.L. R. 388; Vance on Insurance, 2d Ed., pp. 54-56. But the owner of a fully paid life insurance policy has more than the mere right to surrender it; he has the right to retain it for its investment vitues and to receive the face amount of the policy upon the insured's death. That these latter rights are deemed by purchasers of insurance to have substantial value is clear from the difference between the cost of a single-premium policy and its immediate or early cash-surrender value-in the instant case over $135, 000. All of the economic benefits of a policy must be taken into consideration in determining its value for gift-tax purposes. To single out one and to disregard the others is in effect to substitute a different property interest for the one which was the subject of the gift. In this situation as in others (Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 291, 296\n, 51 S.Ct. 434, 436), an important element in the value of the property is the use to which it may be put. Certainly the petitioner here did not expend $852,438.50 to make an immediate gift limited to $717,344.81. Presumptively the value of these policies at the date of the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 254, 258]\n\u00a0\n gift was the amount which the insured had expended to acquire them. Cost is cogent evidence of value. And here it is the only suggested criterion which reflects the value to the owner of the entire bundle of rights in a single-premium policy-the right to retain it as well as the right to surrender it. Cost in this situation is not market price in the normal sense of the term. But the absence of market price is no barrier to valuation. \n5\n Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573, 579\n, 49 S.Ct. 426, 428, 61 A.L.R. 906.\n Petitioner, however, argues that cash-surrender value was made the measure of value by Art. 2(5), Treasury Regulations 79, promulgated October 30, 1933, which provided that the 'irrevocable assignment of a life insurance policy ... constitutes a gift in the amount of the net cash surrender value, if any, plus the prepaid insurance adjusted to the date of the gift.' The argument is that under this regulation the reserve in case of a single-premium policy covers the prepaid insurance and represents the entire value of the policy. The regulation is somewhat ambiguous. But in our view it applied only to policies upon which current premiums were still being paid at the date of the gift, not to single- premium policies. Accordingly, the problem here involves an interpretation of the meaning of 'value' in  506 unaided by an interpretative regulation.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In conflict with the decision below are Commissioner v.

J. HEINZ CO. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD(1941)\nNo. 73\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 515]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Earl F. Reed, and Charles M. Thorp, Jr., both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, Asst. Sol. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n There questions are presented by the petition for certiorari in this case.\n First. Whether there is support in the evidence for the finding of the National Labor Relations Board that petitioner has been guilty of the unfair labor practices \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 516]\n\u00a0\n defined by  8(1) and (2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  158(1, 2), interference with the exercise by its employees of their rights of self- organization guaranteed by  7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, and more particularly interference with the formation and organization of a labor union of its employees.\n Second. Whether the National Labor Relations Board exceeded its authority in ordering the disestablishment of a labor union in whose organization petitioner had interfered, and\n Third. Whether the Board could validly find that petitioner's refusal to join with representatives of the labor organization authorized to represent its employees in collective bargaining, in signing a written contract embodying the terms of their agreement concerning wages, hours and working conditions, constituted a refusal to bargain collectively in violation of  8(5) of the Act, and whether the Board exceeded its authority in ordering petitioner to join in signing the agreement.\n This is a proceeding brought by the National Labor Relations Board in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to enforce the Board's order directing petitioner to cease certain unfair labor practices in which it found that petitioner had engaged, in connection with the organization of the Heinz Employees Association, a plant labor organization of petitioner's employees; to disestablish the Association; to recognize and bargain collectively with the Canning and Pickle Workers Local, Union No. 325, a labor organization affiliated with the American Federation of Labor; and to sign a written contract embodying any agreement which petitioner and the Union may reach respecting wages, hours and working conditions of petitioner's employees. The court of appeals confirmed the findings of the Board and directed compliance with the Board's order without modification. 6 Cir., 110 F.2d 843. We granted certiorari, \n310 \nU.S. 621\n, 60 S.Ct. 1102, the questions raised by the petition being of public impor- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 517]\n\u00a0\n tance in the administration of the Nation Labor Relations Act.\n The Board found that during April and May, 1937, the two rival labor organizations, the Association and the Union, sought to organize petitioner's employees at its Pittsburgh plant. Petitioner's proposal that an election be held to determine which organization represented a majority of its employees was rejected by the Union which called a strike on May 24, 1937. The strike was ultimately settled by a written contract signed by petitioner, the Union, and the Association, which provided for an election, by the employees, under the supervision of a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board for the choice of an organization to represent them in collective bargaining. Meanwhile, and before the election, a majority of petitioner's two thousand employees at the Pittsburgh plant had signed petitions for membership in the Association, but upon the election held June 8, 1937, a majority of the employees cast their ballots for the Union. Petitioner has since recognized and bargained with the Union, but has refused to embody its agreement with the Union in a written contract.\n Before the election the Union had lodged a complaint with the Board concerning the participation by petitioner in the attempted organization of the Association by petitioner's employees. The Board found that petitioner had been guilty of unfair labor practices by interfering in the organization of the Association, contrary to the Act. It found in detail that petitioner, through superintendent, foremen and other supervising employees, had interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in the exercise of their rights to organize in violation of  7, 8(1) of the Act; that it had dominated and interfered with the formation of the Association and contributed to its support within the meaning of  8(2), and that it had refused to sign an agreement with the Union. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 518]\n\u00a0\n On the basis of these and subsidiary findings which need not now be stated, the Board made its order, the terms of which so far as now relevant have already been set forth.\n Petitioner's Responsibility for Unfair Labor Practices. It is unnecessary to make a detailed examination of the evidence supporting the Board's findings respecting unfair labor practices both because the court below, after a thorough examination of the record has confirmed the Board's findings, and because of the nature of petitioner's contention with respect to them. Petitioner does not deny that there is evidence supporting the findings that petitioner's superintendent, during the organization campaign, upbraided employees for attending Union meetings, threatened one with discharge if he joined the Union, spoke to them disparagingly of the Union and directed some of petitioner's foremen to enroll the employees in the Association; or that there was evidence supporting the finding that a general foreman working throughout petitioner's Pittsburgh plant was active in disparaging the Union and its members to employees, and in urging them to repudiate the Union organization, or that three other foremen in charge of particular buildings or departments were active in dissuading employees from joining the Union. All three spoke disparagingly of the Union, one at a meeting of employees which he had called; and two were active in questioning employees concerning their labor union sympathies. Two of them threatened employees with discharge or loss of work or privileges if the Union were recognized.\n There was also evidence that other foremen or forewomen in charge of large groups of employees engaged in similar activities; and that some solicited employees to join the Association; that one of the three foremen induced an employee to solicit signatures to the Association petition during working hours without loss of pay, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 519]\n\u00a0\n and suggested the names of other employees to aid in this work. There was also evidence that leaders or supervisors of employee groups were allowed to go about the plant freely during working hours and without loss of pay to solicit memberships in the Association which was done in the presence of the foremen.\n Petitioner does not seriously dispute this evidence or challenge the findings of the Board summarizing it. The contention is that the activities of these supervisors of employees are not shown to have been authorized or ratified by petitioner; that following a complaint by a representative of the Union, about May 1st, one of petitioner's officers instructed the superintendent that the employees had a right to organize and that he wished the supervising force to understand that they should not be interfered with in any way in organizing, and that on May 21st the officer in question called a meeting of the supervisory force at which he gave like instructions; that there is no evidence of like activities after this time and that since the election petitioner has consistently recognized and bargained with the Union. From all this petitioner concludes that it is not chargeable with any responsibility for the acts of its supervisory employees and that consequently the evidence does not support the findings of unfair labor practices on its part, or justify the Board's order prohibiting petitioner, its officers and agents from interfering with the administration of the Association or contributing to its support.\n Notwithstanding the knowledge from the start of some of petitioner's officers, of the organization campaign, and notwithstanding the unusual excitement and activity in petitioner's plant attending it, we assume that all were unaware of the activities of its supervisory staff complained of, and did nothing to encourage them before the complaint of their activities made by a representative of the Union about May 1st. At that time the cam- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 520]\n\u00a0\n paign for membership in the rival unions was at its height and resulted, as announced some three or four weeks later, in a majority of petitioner's employees signing as members of the Association.\n It is conceded that petitioner's superintendent and foremen have authority to recommend the employment and discharge of workmen. It is in evidence that they can recommend wage increases and that the group leaders also issued orders directing and controlling the employees and their work, with authority to recommend their discharge. There is evidence supporting the Board's conclusion that the employees regarded the foremen and the group leaders as representatives of the petitioner and that a number of employees signed as members of the Association only because of the fear of loss of their jobs or of discrimination by the employer induced by the activities of the foremen and group leaders.\n We do not doubt that the Board could have found these activities to be unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Act if countenanced by petitioner, and we think that to the extent that petitioner may seek or be in a position to secure any advantage from these practices they are not any the less within the condemnation of the Act because petitioner did not authorize or direct them. In a like situation we have recently held that the employer, whose supervising employees had, without his authority, so far as appeared, so participated in the organization activities of his employees as to prejudice their rights of self-organization, could not resist the Board's order appropriately designed to preclude him from gaining any advantage through recognizing or bargaining with a labor organization resulting from such activities. International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72\n, 61 S.Ct. 83, decided November 12, 1940. See National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., \n311 \nU.S. 584\n, 61 S.Ct. 358, decided this day. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 521]\n\u00a0\n The question is not one of legal liability of the employer in damages or for penalties on principles of agency or respondeat superior, but only whether the Act condemns such activities as unfair labor practices so far as the employer may gain from them any advantage in the bargaining process of a kind which the Act proscribes. To that extent we hold that the employer is within the reach of the Board's order to prevent any repetition of such activities and to remove the consequences of them upon the employees' right of self-organization, quite as much as if he had directed them.\n This is the more so here where petitioner, when advised of the participation of his supervising employees in the organization campaign, took no step, so far as appears, to notify the employees that those activities were unauthorized, or to correct the impression of the employees that support of the Union was not favored by petitioner and would result in reprisals. From that time on the Board could have found that petitioner was as responsible for the effect of the activities of its foremen and group leaders upon the organization of the Association as if it had directed them in advance. The Board could have concluded that this effect was substantial, for it was in the succeeding three weeks that more than one-half of the majority of petitioner's employees who joined the Association signed their petitions for membership. We think there was adequate basis for the Board's order prohibiting petitioner, its officers and agents, from interfering with the exercise of its employees' rights of self-organization or with the administration of the Association or contributing to its support.\n The Order Disestablishing the Association. What we have said of the unfair labor practices found by the Board, when considered with its unchallenged findings as to the relations of petitioner to the two unions, affords \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 522]\n\u00a0\n the answer to petitioner's contention that the Board was without authority to compel disestablishment of the Association. Disestablishment is a remedial measure under  10(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c), to be employed by the Board in its discretion to remove the obstacle to the employees' right of self-organization, resulting from the continued or renewed recognition of a union whose organization has been influenced by unfair labor practices. Whether this recognition is such an obstacle is an inference of fact to be drawn by the Board from all the circumstances attending those practices. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307; National Labor Relations Board v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., \n308 \nU.S. 241, 250\n, 60 S.Ct. 203, 208.\n Petitioner argues that as it has now recognized the Union and bargains with it, it should be equally free to recognize the Association instead of the Union whenever the former represents a majority of the employees. But in weighing this contention the Board could consider, as it did, that petitioner had failed to notify its employees that it repudiated the participation of its supervising employees in the organization of the Association and so has not removed the belief of the employees that petitioner favored and would continue to favor the Association and the employees joining it over others; that it had not mentioned the name of the Union in its bulletins announcing the terms of its agreement with the Union, and although it had reached an agreement with the Union had persistently refused to sign any written contract with it.\n From this and other circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the Board inferred, as it might, that the influence of the participation of petitioner's employees in the organization of the Association had not been removed and that there was danger that petitioner would seek to take advantage of such continuing influence to renew \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 523]\n\u00a0\n its recognition of the Association and control its action. This we think afforded adequate basis for the Board's order. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Falk Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 453, 461\n, 462 S., 60 S.Ct. 307, 311, 312; National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., supra. Nothing in the order precludes members of the Association from establishing an organization independently of participation by petitioner and its officers and agents, and from securing recognition through certification of the Board or an election as provided by  9(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  159(c).\n The Employer's Refusal to Sign a Written Agreement. It is conceded that although petitioner has reached an agreement with the Union concerning wages, hours and working conditions of the employees, it has nevertheless refused to sign any contract embodying the terms of the agreement. The Board supports its order directing petitioner, on request of the Union, to sign a written contract embodying the terms agreed upon on the ground, among others, that a refusal to sign is a refusal to bargain within the meaning of the Act.\n In support of this contention it points to the history of the collective bargaining process showing that its object has long been an agreement between employer and employees as to wages, hours and working conditions evidenced by a signed contract or statement in writing, which serves both as recognition of the union with which the agreement is reached and as a permanent memorial of its terms. \n1\n This experience has shown that refusal to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 524]\n\u00a0\n sign a written contract has been a not infrequent means of frustrating the bargaining process through the refusal to recognize the labor organization as a party to it and the refusal to provide an authentic record of its terms which could be exhibited to employees, as evidence of the good faith of the employer. Such refusals have proved fruitful sources of dissatisfaction and disagreement. \n2\n Contrasted with the unilateral statement by the employer of his labor policy, the signed agreement has been regarded as the effective instrument of stabilizing labor relations and preventing, through collective bargaining, strikes and industrial strife. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Before the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act it had been the settled practice of the administrative agencies dealing with labor relations to treat the signing of a written contract embodying a wage and hour agreement as the final step in the bargaining process. \n4\n Congress, in enacting the National Labor Relations Act, had before it the record of this experience, H.Rept. No. 1147, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5, and see also pp. 3, 7, 15-18, 20-22, 24; S.Rept. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2, 8, 9, 13, 15, 17. The House Committee recom- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 525]\n\u00a0\n mended the legislation as 'an amplification and clarification of the principles enacted into law by the Railway Labor Act and by  7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act.' H.Rept. 1147, supra, p. 3 and stated, page 7, that  7 and 8 of the Act guaranteeing collective bargaining to employees was a reenactment of the like \n305 \nU.S. 197, 236\n, 59 S.Ct. 206, 219, 83 L.Ed. Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 198, see Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197, 236\n, 59 S.Ct. 206, 219; Labor Board v. Sands Mfg. Co., \n306 \nU.S. 332, 342\n, 59 S.Ct. 508, 513.\n We think that Congress, in thus incorporating in the new legislation the collective bargaining requirement of the earlier statutes included as a part of it, the signed agreement long recognized under the earlier acts as the final step in the bargaining process. It is true that the National Labor Relations Act, while requiring the employer to bargain collectively, does not compel him to enter into an agreement. But it does not follow, as petitioner argues, that, having reached an agreement, he can refuse to sign it, because he has never agreed to sign one. He may never have agreed to bargain but the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 514, 526]\n\u00a0\n statute requires him to do so. To that extent his freedom is restricted in order to secure the legislative objective of collective bargaining as the means of curtailing labor disputes affecting interstate commerce. The freedom of the employer to refuse to make an agreement relates to its terms in matters of substance and not, once it is reached, to its expression in a signed contract, the absence of which, as experience has shown, tends to frustrate the end sought by the requirement for collective bargaining. A business man who entered into negotiations with another for an agreement having numerous provisions, with the reservation that he would not reduce it to writing or sign it, could hardly be thought to have bargained in good faith. This is even more so in the case of an employer who, by his refusal to honor, with his signature, the agreement which he has made with a labor organization, discredits the organization, impairs the bargaining process and tends to frustrate the aim of the statute to secure industrial peace through collective bargaining.\n Petitioner's refusal to sign was a refusal to bargain collectively and an unfair labor practice defined by  8(5). The Board's order requiring petitioner at the request of the Union to sign a written contract embodying agreed terms is authorized by  10(c). This is the conclusion which has been reached by five of the six courts of appeals which have passed upon the question. \n5\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Lewis L.

SCHAFFNER(1941)\nNo. 437\nArgued: March 4, 1941Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Herbert A. Friedlich, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In December, 1929, respondent, the life beneficiary of a testamentary trust, 'assigned' to certain of her children specified amounts in dollars from the income of the trust for the year following the assignment. She made a like assignment to her children and a son-in-law in November, 1930. The question for decision is whether, under the applicable 1928 Revenue Act, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 351 et seq., the assigned income, which was paid by the trustees to the several assignees, is taxable as such to the assignor or to the assignees.\n The Commissioner ruled that the income was that of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 579, 580]\n\u00a0\n the life beneficiary and assessed a deficiency against her for the calendar years 1930 and 1931, which she paid. In the present suit to recover the tax paid as illegally exacted the District Court below gave judgment for the taxpayer, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. 7 Cir., 113 F.2d 449. We granted certiorari November 12, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 638\n, 61 S. Ct. 134, 85 L.Ed. --, to resolve an alleged conflict in principle of the decision below with those in Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241; Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, 52 S.Ct. 345, and Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554.\n Since granting certiorari we have held, following the reasoning of Lucas v. Earl, supra, that one who is entitled to receive at a future date, interest or compensation for services and who makes a gift of it by an anticipatory assignment, realizes taxable income quite as much as if he had collected the income and paid it over to the object of his bounty. Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, 131 A.L.R. 655; Helvering v. Eubank, \n311 \nU.S. 122\n, 61 S.Ct. 149. Decision in these cases was rested on the principle that the power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership of it and that the exercise of the power to procure its payment to another, whether to pay a debt or to make a gift, is within the reach of the statute taxing income 'derived from any source whatever'. In the light of our opinions in these cases the narrow question presented by this record is whether it makes any difference in the application of the taxing statute that the gift is accomplished by the anticipatory assignment of trust income rather than of interest, dividends, rents and the like which are payable to the donor.\n Respondent, recognizing that the practical consequences of a gift by assignment, in advance, of a year's income from the trust, are, so far as the use and enjoyment of the income are concerned, no different from those of the gift by assignment of interest or wages, rests his case on technical distinctions affecting the conveyanc- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 579, 581]\n\u00a0\n ing of equitable interests. It is said that since by the assignment of trust income the assignee acquires an equitable right to an accounting by the trustee which, for many purposes, is treated by courts of equity as a present equitable estate in the trust property, it follows that each assignee in the present case is a donee of an interest in the trust property for the term of a year and is thus the recipient of income from his own property which is taxable to him rather than to the donor. See Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5\n, 57 S.Ct. 330.\n We lay to one side the argument which the Government could have made that the assignments were no more than an attempt to charge the specified payments upon the whole income which could pass no present interest in the trust property. See Scott on Trusts,  10.1, 10.6, 29, 30. For we think that the operation of the statutes taxing income is not dependent upon such 'attenuated subtleties', but rather on the import and reasonable construction of the taxing act. Lucas v. Earl, supra, 281 U.S. page 114, 50 S.Ct. page 241.\n Section 22(a) of the 1928 Revenue Act provides, \"Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from ... interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever'. By  161(a) and 162(b) the tax is laid upon the income 'of any kind of property held in trust', and income of a trust for the taxable year which is to be distributed to the beneficiaries is to be taxed to them 'whether distributed to them or not'. In construing these and like provisions in other revenue acts we have uniformly held that they are not so much concerned with the refinements of title as with the actual command over the income which is taxed and the actual benefit for which the tax is paid. See Corliss v. Bowers, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 579, 582]\n\u00a0\n \n281 \nU.S. 376\n, 50 S.Ct. 336; Lucas v. Earl, supra; Helvering v. Horst, supra; Helvering v. Eubank, supra; Helvering v. Clifford, supra. It was for that reason that in each of those cases it was held that one vested with the right to receive income did not escape the tax by any kind of anticipatory arrangement, however skillfully devised, by which he procures payment of it to another, since, by the exercise of his power to command the income, he enjoys the benefit of the income on which the tax is laid.\n Those decisions are controlling here. Taxation is a practical matter and those practical considerations which support the treatment of the disposition of one's income by way of gift as a realization of the income to the donor are the same whether the income be from a trust or from shares of stock or bonds which he owns. It is true, as respondent argues, that where the beneficiary of a trust had assigned a share of the income to another for life without retaining any form of control over the interest assigned, this Court construed the assignment as a transfer in praesenti to the donee, of a life interest in the corpus of the trust property and held in consequence that the income thereafter paid to the donee was taxable to him and not the donor. Blair v. Commissioner, supra. But we think it quite another matter to say that the beneficiary of a trust who makes a single gift of a sum of money payable out of the income of the trust does not realize income when the gift is effectuated by payment, or that he escapes the tax by attempting to clothe the transaction in the guise of a transfer of trust property rather than the transfer of income where that is its obvious purpose and effect. We think that the gift by a beneficiary of a trust of some part of the income derived from the trust property for the period of a day, a month or a year involves no such substantial disposition of the trust property as to camouflage the reality that he is \n\n[312 \nU.S. 579, 583]\n\u00a0\n enjoying the benefit of the income from the trust of which he continues to be the beneficiary, quite as much as he enjoys the benefits of interest or wages which he gives away as in the Horst and Eubank cases. Even though the gift of income be in form accomplished by the temporary disposition of the donor's property which produces the income, the donor retaining every other substantial interest in it, we have not allowed the form to obscure the reality. Income which the donor gives away through the medium of a short term trust created for the benefit of the donee is nevertheless income taxable to the donor. Helvering v. Clifford, supra; Hormel v. Helvering, \n312 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. --, decided March 17, 1941. We perceive no difference, so far as the construction and application of the Revenue Act is concerned, between a gift of income in a specified amount by the creation of a trust for a year, see Hormel v. Helvering, supra, and the assignment by the beneficiary of a trust already created of a like amount from its income for a year.\n Nor are we troubled by the logical difficulties of drawing the line between a gift of an equitable interest in property for life effected by a gift for life of a share of the income of the trust and the gift of the income or a part of it for the period of a year as in this case. 'Drawing the line' is a recurrent difficulty in those fields of the law where differences in degree produce ultimate differences in kind. See Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 168\n, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476. It is enough that we find in the present case that the taxpayer, in point of substance, has parted with no substantial interest in property other than the specified payments of income which, like other gifts of income, are taxable to the donor. Unless in the meantime the difficulty be resolved by statute or treasury regulation, we leave it to future judicial decisions to determine precisely where the line shall be drawn between gifts of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 579, 584]\n\u00a0\n income-producing property and gifts of income from property of which the donor remains the owner, for all substantial and practical purposes.

By his will it was provided that his residuary estate should be divided into four parts. One part was devised and bequeathed to trustees: 'To receive, hold and, from time to time, invest and reinvest the same, and to collect the rents, income, issues, and profits on the property from time to time constituting such trust fund and to pay over so much of the net income arising therefrom, as to my said trustees shall seem wise and proper toward the support, maintenance, and education of my daughter, Marjorie Knox, until she shall arrive at the age of twenty-one (21) years, and to accumulate the balance of the income during her minority for her benefit, and to pay over the accumulated income to her when she shall arrive at the age of twenty-one (21) years and thereafter to pay over the entire net income to my said daughter, Marjorie Knox, until she shall arrive at the age of twenty-eight (28) years, at which time, I give, devise, and bequeath to my said daughter, Marjorie Knox, one-half (1\/2) of the property then constituting said trust fund and I direct my said trustees to pay over the net income on the remaining one-half (1\/2) of said trust fund until she shall arrive at the age of thirty-five (35) years, at which time I give, devise, and bequeath the remaining part of said trust fund to my said daughter, Marjorie Knox, and to her heirs and assigns forever. In the event that my said daughter, Marjorie Knox, shall die before reaching the age of thirty-five (35) years, I give, devise, and bequeath any part or portion of said trust fund, which has not then been paid over to her, or to the possession of which at the time of her death she was not entitled, unto the issue of said Marjorie Knox, if any, surviving her, to be divided among them, share and share alike. And in case there be no issue her surviving, then I give, devise, and bequeath said trust fund unto her heirs.' \n\n[313 \nU.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n Marjorie Knox is respondent Marjorie K. Campbell. Another part of the residuary estate was placed in trust for respondent Dorothy K. G. Rogers, under the same terms. And a third part together with certain securities was placed in trust for respondent Seymour H. Knox, under similar terms. He, however, was to receive $500,000 of the trust fund when he reached the age of twenty-five, one-half of the remaining trust fund when he became thirty, and the balance at thirty-five. Meanwhile, the income was payable to him. On July 1, 1921, the executors, pursuant to an order of the probate court, transferred the property to the trustees.\n Marjorie K. Campbell attained the age of twenty-eight on July 10, 1928, and received at that time one-half of the property of her trust. Certain of the securities which she then received were sold by her during 1933 and certain of the bonds matured and were paid during 1933. Some of those securities had been held by her father at his death, others had been purchased by the executors, and some had been purchased by the trustees. In 1926 and 1927 she purchased stock of the F. W. Woolworth Co., which with dividends received in 1927 amounted to 1000 shares. In 1928 she received delivery from the trustees of 15,000 shares of Woolworth stock which represented shares owned by her father at his death, a subsequent tax-free stock split-up, stock dividends, and purchases by the trustees. In 1929 she surrendered the 16,000 shares she owned and received tax free 40,000 shares pursuant to a split-up of the stock. In 1933 she sold 10,000 of the shares received in 1929. There is no way of identifying the shares sold with any particular shares surrendered in 1929.\n Dorothy K. G. Rogers became twenty-eight on August 26, 1924, and thirty-five on August 26, 1931, at which times she received distributions of the corpus. During \n\n[313 \nU.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n 1933 she sold securities so received. Some of those securities had been purchased by the trustees, some by the executors, and others had been owned by her father at his death.\n Seymour H. Knox attained the age of thirty on September 1, 1928, and received on that date one-half of the corpus, including 8,575 shares of stock of Maine Share Corp., of which 5,160 were purchased by the trustees on August 31, 1927, and 3,415 were purchased by the trustees on August 30, 1928. He later exchanged those shares in a nontaxable transaction and on June 10, 1930, sold the shares received in that exchange.\n The Board of Tax Appeals1 and the Circuit Court of Appeals ( Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gambrill, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 530) held: ( 1) that the basis to respondents under  113(a)(5) of the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 19322 as respects sales made by them was the fair market value at the time when the securities were delivered to them by the trustees, no matter when or how the trustees or the executors may have obtained the securities; (2) that in determining how long respondent Knox held securities for purposes of computing the term of his holding under  101 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 370, the date of transfer from the trustees should govern; and (3) that as respects the sale of Woolworth stock by respondent Campbell, her own shares should be treated, under the 'first-in-first-out' rule, as sold prior to those which were delivered to her by the trustees.\n It follows from our holding in Maguire v. Commissioner, supra, that the rulings on the first issue were erroneous. As respects the securities owned by the decedent at death, the basis is their value when delivered \n\n[313 \nU.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n by the executors to the trustees. As respects the securities purchased by the trustees, the basis is cost to the trustees. And we are of the view that as respects securities purchased by the executors the basis is the value when delivered by them to the trustees. As we said in Maguire v. Commissioner, supra, the legislative history of  113(a)(5) clearly indicates that it applies to purchases by executors. Hence it follows from our reasoning in Maguire v. Commissioner, supra, that the date of delivery by the trustees to the beneficiaries is no more appropriate here than it is in case of property owned by the decedent at date of death.\n We also disagree with the court below on the second issue. Some of the securities were sold by respondent Knox more than two years after they had been purchased by the trustees. \n3\n For the reasons stated in Helvering v. Gambrill, supra, it follows, therefore, that they had been 'held' by him for more than two years within the meaning of  101(c)(8), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, page 371.\n We also take a different view on the third proposition. The 'first-in- firstout' rule is reflected in Treasury Regulations. The general rule4 is that where shares of stock cannot be identified with any particular lots purchased, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 15, 21]\n\u00a0\n they will be charged against the earliest purchases. \n5\n For the purpose of determining the earliest purchases the regulation6 adopts the rule of tacking contained in  101(c)(8)(B). That being true, it must be presumed that the Woolworth stock coming from the decedent's estate was first sold. The holding by the trustees is included in that of the beneficiary. Hence, as we indicated in Helvering v. Gambrill, supra, the date of acquisition by the beneficiary was the date of death. It is that date of acquisition which governs the application of the 'first-in-first-out' rule. Therefore, the court below was in error in ruling that respondent Campbell's own shares were sold first.\n Respondents have contended, at least in regard to some of these issues, that the nature of their remainder interests necessitates a different result. Thus, in case of respondent Knox it is strongly urged that in view of the conditional nature of his remainder interest he held the securities only from the date when his interest became indefeasible and the securities were distributed to him, since one cannot be deemed to have held or acquired property which he might never obtain. But unlike the situation in Helvering v. Hallock, \n309 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 444, 125 A.L.R. 1368, we are not concerned here with the question as to when the transfers took effect for purposes of the estate tax. As we indicated in Maguire v. Commissioner, supra, we are \n\n[313 \nU.S. 15, 22]\n\u00a0\n dealing only with a point of reference and a standard of value for determination of gains or losses realized on subsequent sales of property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance. For that purpose distinctions between vested and contingent remainders or between absolute and conditional properly interests have no relevancy. Each remainderman has become the taxpayer because he has obtained possession and control of the property and has sold it. While the property is held in trust, the vested remainderman has no more rights of possession and control than the contingent remainderman. Yet each has acquired a property interest. The statutory provisions here in question come into play when that interest later ripens into full ownership and a sale is made. Hence the value of the property at the time when the taxpayer first acquires an interest in it has relevance to a subsequent determination of the gains or losses. As we remarked in Maguire v. Commissioner, supra, the residuary legatee in Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327\n, 50 S.Ct. 115, was held to have acquired his interest at date of death though at that time it was not absolute. To be sure, in these cases the interest of the remaindermen in the property at the earlier time was limited by the very terms of the bequest. But the tax here in question is not on their remainder interests; it is on gains realized by them as owners of that property. Hence, to carry into that computation the earlier value of the property is not to tax them on values which they never received. It merely provides a rule of thumb in alleviation of a tax which would be computed by reference to the entire amount of the original inheritance were it to be based on cost to the taxpayer.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS think the judgments should be affirmed for the reasons stated by the court below, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gambrill, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 530. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The opinion of the Board in Helvering v.

ENRIGHT'S ESTATE(1941)\nNo. 436\nArgued: March 4, 1941Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 637]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Gordon Tweedy, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. James D. Carpenter, Jr., of Jersey City, N.J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari was granted to review the judgment below1 because of a conflict between it and Pfaff v. Commissioner2 in the Second Circuit. The issue is whether  42 of the Revenue Act of 19343 permits the inclusion, as accruable items, in a decedent's gross income for the period ending with his death of his share of the profits earned, but not yet received, of a partnership, when both the decedent and the partnership reported income on a cash receipts and disbursements basis.\n Respondents are the executors of John M. Enright, an attorney and member of a law partnership in New Jersey. Both Mr. Enright and his firm kept their accounts and made their income tax report on a calendar year cash receipts and disbursements basis. He died, testate, No- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 638]\n\u00a0\n vember 19, 1934. The partnership agreement provided for the termination of the partnership on the death of any partner and that his estate should have his partnership percentage in the 'net monies then in the treasury of the firm, plus his like percentage in the outstanding accounts and the earned proportion of the estimated receipts from unfinished business.' The will directed that the valuation for the purpose of closing out the partnership should be made by his senior surviving partner, Mr. James D. Carpenter, and by agreement between Mr. Carpenter and the executors a valuation was made of these items as of the date of death for use in the Federal estate tax and New Jersey inheritance tax returns, with the further understanding that the surviving partners would pay over to the executors whatever was ultimately realized out of the valued assets.\n Pursuant to this arrangement the interest of Mr. Enright in the uncollected accounts was valued at $2,055.55 and in the unfinished work at $ 40,855.77. These sums were reported as assets in the estate and inheritance tax returns but were not included in the income tax return made for the decedent for 1934 nor were the sums derived from these assets reported in the estate's income tax for 1934 or later years.\n The Commissioner assessed a deficiency because he included in the decedent's return for 1934, under the claimed authority of  42, supra note 3, the items of accounts and unfinished work. Respondents appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. The Board decided4 that the evidence did not show the situation of the unfinished work in sufficient detail to enable the Board to determine independently that it was not accruable. The accounts \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 639]\n\u00a0\n receivable were held accruable. This left the Commissioner's assessment intact.\n On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board. It was of the opinion that the partnership was a tax computing unit separate from its members and that  42 had the effect of placing the decedent 'upon an accrual basis at the date of his death.' (112 F.2d 920.) Consequently his return should be made as it would have been made if the deceased used the accrual method. The Court then reasoned that the requirement of  182 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 728, including a partner's distributive share of the partnership earnings, whether distributed or not, in the partner's computation of his own net income, put a partner on an accrual basis in accounting for partnership earnings, irrespective of  42. Consequently  42 was held not to affect the partnership accounting practices. It was further determined that it was the right to receive payment which made an earning accrue and that as Mr. Enright under the partnership agreement had no right to receive anything from the firm except his proportionate share of the cash receipts, these cash receipts were all that 'accrued' to him before his death.\n The last sentence of  42 which requires the inclusion of 'amounts accrued up to the date of his death' in computing net income for the period in which his death falls was added by the 1934 Revenue Act. \n5\n The reports recommended its addition because the 'courts have held that income accrued by a decedent on the cash basis prior to his death is not income to the estate, and under the present law, unless such income is taxable to the decedent, it escapes income tax altogether.' \n6\n So  42 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 640]\n\u00a0\n was drawn to require the inclusion of all amounts accrued to the date of death 'regardless of the fact that he may have kept his books on a cash basis.' \n7\n With the declared purpose of Congress in mind we proceed to examine the meaning of the section.\n As the questioned items of unfinished work appear in the partnership accounts, we must determine whether such earnings, even if accruable, are includible in the partner's return for 1934. Respondent argues, as the Circuit Court of Appeals held, that  1828 accrues, without any effect from the language of  42, all the earnings that are includible in a partner's return, and that since the partnership method of keeping its books did not treat unfinished business as receipts, only the earnings actually collected are a part of the partner's distributive share under  182.\n We think such a conclusion is erroneous. The partnership agreement and the subsequent arrangement between the executors and the surviving partners called for a valu- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 641]\n\u00a0\n ation on Mr. Enright's death and a dissolution as of that day. This necessitated an accounting of partnership earnings for this period. By the terms of the agreement, as would have been necessary anyway, the earned proportion of the unfinished business was to be valued to determine the decedent's interest in the partnership assets. \n9\n Assuming at this point that the unfinished business is accruable, this accounting as of the time of death would show the partnership income for the taxable year of the partnership. 10 As the net income of the partnership is to be accounted for in the deceased partner's return, without consideration of the period over which the income is earned, the fact that the payment for the unfinished business will not be collected until another taxable year is immaterial. 'Circumstances wholly fortuitous may determine the year in which income, whenever earned, is taxable.' \n11\n The 'distributive share' re- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 642]\n\u00a0\n ferred to in  182 does not mean available in cash for payment to the partner. It means only that gains attributable to the partner's interest in the firm were earned. Partnership returns may be made on a different basis of computation than those of the members. \n12\n Thus because of the partnership arrangement and agreement, the value of the unfinished business must be determined as of the date of death. Further the result, under the assumption here that it is an accrual, is a distributive share and is to be carried into the partner's return. Respondent's argument that the requirement of  182, including all distributable shares in the partner's return, puts all partnership returns on the accrual basis fails to give weight to the fact that a partnership on the cash method shows only cash receipts as a partner's distributive share. The requirement to account for a distributive share, although the share is actually not distributed, is not a requirement to account for partnership income on an accrual basis. Since a partner's return of his partnership earnings would vary, dependent upon whether the partnership used the cash or accrual method of accounting, we do not agree with respondent's suggestion.\n We turn now to whether this valuation of the decedent's interest in the partnership is an accrual of income which must be reflected in the income tax or a valuation of assets only reflected in estate or inheritance reports. This partnership uses the cash receipts method. There was no customary accounting system to determine whether the value of services rendered should be accrued before payment. Under such circumstances, we are of the view that items of partnership income properly accrued should be included in the income tax return of the deceased partner. This will cause the accrued items of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 643]\n\u00a0\n partnership returns to be included in the income tax return of a deceased partner, whether the partnership method is accrual or cash. \n13\n Furthermore, an accrual of compensation for the unfinished business seems sound in view of the purpose of the enactment of  42.\n The meaning of 'amounts accrued up to the date of his death' is clear as to fixed rent, interest, salary or wages for personal services and other similar income which may readily be attributed to a particular period. There are like deductions such as interest and taxes. \n14\n The uncertainty as to the meaning arises in the field of personal service from items which cannot be accounted for on a basis of successive equal units of time. Examples of the difficulty are the value, prior to a successful result, of services rendered on a contingent basis, done on a quantum meruit whether that would or would not vary with the outcome, or exploratory or preliminary steps looking towards final accomplishment.\n While 'accrue' and its various derivatives are not new to the nomenclature of accounting or taxation, its use has not sufficed to build it into a word of art with a definite connotation when employed in describing items of gross income. The 1913 Act15 put the taxpayer on an actual cash receipt and disbursement basis. The 1916 Act16 gave the taxpayer the option of reporting on either the cash or accrual basis and the 1918 Act limited the return to the method of accounting regularly employed unless otherwise directed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 17 A similar provision covers the year \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 644]\n\u00a0\n here in question. 18 That the meaning to be attributed to 'accrued' as used in  42 is to be gathered from its surroundings is emphasized by  48, Definitions, which says: '(c) Paid, incurred, accrued. The terms 'paid or incurred' and 'paid or accrued' shall be construed according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed under this Part.' \n19\n\u00a0\n\n It is to be noted that no change was made by the 1934 Act in the  48 definition of 'accrued.' \n20\n Yet, it is obvious that the definition is inapplicable since a taxpayer on a cash basis cannot have a 'method of accounting' by which the meaning of accrual is fixed. Consequently it is beside the point to give weight to provisions of the regulations or accounting practices which do not recognize accruals until a determination of compensation. \n21\n Such provisions when applied bring the income into succeeding years. It has been frequently said, and correctly, that  42 was aimed at putting the cash receipt taxpayer on the accrual basis. \n22\n But that statement does not answer the meaning of accrual in this section. Accounts kept consistently on a basis other than cash receipts might treat accruals quite differently from a method designed to reflect the earned income of a cash receipt taxpayer. Accruals here are to be construed in furtherance of the intent of Congress to cover into income the assets of decedents, earned during their life \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 645]\n\u00a0\n and unreported as income, which on a cash return, would appear in the estate returns. Congress sought a fair reflection of income. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n Accrued income obviously connotes more than interest. In United States v. American Can Company,24 this Court approved an accrual basis where 'pecuniary obligations payable to or by the company were treated as if discharged when incurred.' In United States v. Anderson25 accruals of fixed annual charges, e.g., taxes payable in another year, were permitted against determinable gross income. 'Keeping accounts and making returns on the accrual basis, as distinguished from the cash basis, import that it is the right to receive and not the actual receipt that determines the inclusion of the amount in gross income.' \n26\n The completion of the work in progress was necessary to fix the amount due but the right to payment for work ordinarily arises on partial performance. Accrued income under  42 for uncompleted operations includes the value of the services rendered by the decedent, capable of approximate valuation whether based on the agreed compensation or on quantum meruit. The requirement of valuation comprehends the elements of collectibility. \n27\n The items here meet these tests and are subject to accrual. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 636, 646]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 3 Cir., 112 F.2d 919. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 113 F.2d 114.

Respond- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 11, 12]\n\u00a0\n ent was a remainderman under a trust created by the will of his grandmother1 who died in 1897. The trust res, consisting of personalty, was delivered by the executors to themselves as trustees in 1898. The life beneficiary, respondent's mother, died in March, 1928. On May 5, 1928, the trustees delivered the corpus to respondent as remainderman. Some of the property was part of the original trust res, and some was purchased by the trustees both prior to and subsequent to March 1, 1913. During the year 1930 (in February, on May 6, and in June) respondent sold some of the property in each group. The Board of Tax Appeals (38 B.T.A. 981) and the Circuit Court of Appeals (2 Cir., 112 F.2d 530) held: (1) that for the purpose of determining gain or loss on the sale of the property in question the basis to respondent by virtue of  113(a)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 380, was the fair market value of the property on the date when the corpus was delivered to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 11, 13]\n\u00a0\n respondent; and (2) that the property sold in February, 1930, had not been held by the taxpayer for more than two years and was, therefore, not a capital asset within the meaning of  101(c) of the 1928 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 371, while that sold on May 6 and in June, 1930, had been held by respondent for more than two years and was therefore a capital asset.\n The rulings on the first question were erroneous. For the reasons stated in Maguire v. Commissioner, supra, the basis under  113(a)(5) for the property delivered to respondent by the testamentary trustees was its value when distributed by the executors to the trustees if the property was owned by the decedent at her death, and cost to the trustees if it was purchased by them. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n We also disagree with the disposition made of the second question. Capital gains or losses are defined as those resulting from sales or exchanges of capital assets.  101(c)(1) and (2). Capital assets are defined (with exceptions not material here) as 'property held by the taxpayer for more than two years.'  101(c)(8). And  101(c)(8)(B) provides: 'In determining the period for which the taxpayer has held property however acquired there shall be included the period for which such property was held by any other person, if under the provisions of section 113, such property has, for the purpose of determining gain or loss from a sale or exchange, the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 11, 14]\n\u00a0\n same basis in whole or in part in his hands as it would have in the hands of such other person.'\n We are of the view that under these provisions respondent's holding period dates from the decedent's death for property which she then owned and from the date of purchase for property purchased by the trustees. In McFeely v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 102\n, 56 S.Ct. 54, 101 A.L.R. 304, this Court held that a legatee's holding period under  101(c)(8) of the 1928 Act dated from the decedent's death for property owned by the decedent and distributed to the legatee by the executors, in spite of the fact that the legatee's basis under  113(a)(5) was value at the time of distribution to him by the executors. The date of acquisition was held to be the date of death, regardless of the gap between that date and the date of distribution. And that result was reached even though some of the taxpayers involved were residuary legatees whose interests at date of death were not unconditional. The reasoning of that case plus  101(c)(8)( B) make it plain that respondent's interest, albeit a remainder, was acquired at the date of decedent's death for property then owned and at the date of purchase for property purchased by the trustees. The continuity in his holding was not broken by the intervening trust. The formal constitution of that trust though of special significance under  113(a)(5) (Maguire v. Commissioner, supra) did not change the basic quality of his property interest. And the fact that that interest did not ripen into full and complete ownership except by the passage of time or the occurrence of subsequent events is inconsequential. For  101(c)(8)(B) provides, as we have seen, that in determining the taxpayer's holding period there shall be included the period for which the property was held by any other person if under  113 the property had the same basis in whole or in part in the taxpayer's hands as it would have in the hands of the other person. It is plain that under \n\n[313 \nU.S. 11, 15]\n\u00a0\n s 113 the basis to the trustees was the same as the basis to the taxpayer. Hence the period of their holding is not to be excluded from the period of the taxpayer's holding. That makes plain that 'property held by the taxpayer' as used in  101(c)(8) embraces not only full ownership but also any interest whether vested, contingent, or conditional. Otherwise the period of the holding by trustees would not be included in the holding by a mere remainderman. Hence, as in McFeely v. Commissioner, supra, we look to the time when the taxpayer first acquired the interest which later ripened into full ownership. It is plain that for property owned by the decedent he acquired that interest at her death and that for property purchased by the trustees he acquired that interest at the date of purchase.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS think the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated by the court below, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 530. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Respondent was the sole surviving issue of his mother, Anna Van Nest Gambrill, and took under the following provisions of his grandmother's will:\n'Ninth.

HAMMEL(1941)\nNo. 49\nArgued: December 11, 1940Decided: January 6, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Norman D. Keller, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. John J. Sloan, of Detroit, Mich., for respondents. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 505]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to say whether a loss sustained by an individual taxpayer upon the foreclosure sale of his interest in real estate, acquired for profit, is a loss which, under  23(e)(2) of the 1934 Revenue Act, 48 Stat. 680, may be deducted in full from gross income for the purpose of arriving at taxable income, or is a capital loss deductible only to the limited extent provided in  23(e)(2), (j), and 117, 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 672, 673, 707.\n In the computation of taxable income  23(e)(2) of the 1934 Revenue Act permits the individual taxpayer to deduct losses sustained during the year incurred in any transaction for profit. Subsection (j) provides that 'losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets' shall be allowed only to the extent of $2,000 plus gains from such sales or exchanges as provided by  117(d). By  117(b) it is declared that 'capital assets' 'means property held by the taxpayer ... but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer ... or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.'\n Respondent taxpayers, with other members of a syndicate, purchased 'on land contract' a plot of land in Oakland County, Michigan, for the sum of $96,0000, upon a down payment of $20,000. The precise nature of the contract does not appear beyond the fact that payments for the land were to be made in installments, and the vendor retained an interest in the land as security for payment of the balance of the purchase price. Before the purchase price was paid in full the syndicate defaulted on its payments. The vendor instituted foreclosure proceedings by suit in equity in a state court which resulted in a judicial sale of the property, the vendor becoming the purchaser, and in a deficiency judgment against the members of the syndicate. Respond- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 506]\n\u00a0\n ents' contribution to the purchase money, some $4,000, was lost.\n The commissioner, in computing respondents' taxable income for 1934, treated the taxpayers' interest in the land as a capital asset and allowed deduction of the loss from gross income only to the extent of $2,000 as provided by  23(j) and 117(d), in the case of losses from sales of capital assets. The Board of Tax Appeals ruled that the loss was deductible in full. The circuit court of appeals affirmed, 6 Cir., 108 F. 2d 753, holding that the loss established by the foreclosure sale was not a loss from a 'sale' within the meaning of  23(j). We granted certiorari, \n310 \nU.S. 619\n, 60 S.Ct. 1077, to resolve a conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Commissioner v. Electro-Chemical Engraving Co., 110 F.2d 614.\n It is not denied that it was the foreclosure sale of respondents' interest in the land purchased by the syndicate for profit, which finally liquidated the capital investment made by its members and fixed the precise amount of the loss which respondents seek to deduct as such from gross income. But they argue that the 'losses from sales' which by  23(j) are made deductible only to the limited extent provided by  117(d) are those losses resulting from sales voluntarily made by the taxpayer, and that losses resulting from forced sales like the present not being subject to the limitations of  117(d) are deductible in full like other losses under  23(e)(2).\n To read this qualification into the statute respondents rely on judicial decisions applying the familiar rule that a restrictive covenant against sale or assignment refers to the voluntary action of the covenantor and not to transfers by operation of law or judicial sales in invitum.

Williams, \n210 \nU.S. 41\n, 28 S.Ct. 687; Riggs \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 507]\n\u00a0\n v. Pursell, 66 N.Y. 193. But here we are not concerned with a restrictive covenant of the taxpayer, but with a sale as an effective means of establishing a deductible loss for the purpose of computing his income tax. The term sale may have many meanings, depending on the context, see Webster's New International Dictionary. The meaning here depends on the purpose with which it is used in the statute and the legislative history of that use. Hence the respondents argue that the purpose of providing in the 1934 Act for a special treatment of gains or losses from capital assets was to prevent tax avoidance by depriving the taxpayer of the option allowed to him by the earlier acts, to effect losses deductible in full by sales of property at any time within two years after it was acquired, which until held for that period was not defined as a capital asset,  208, Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 262, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 13;  208, Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 19, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, page 157, and  101 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 811, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 370.\n It is said that since losses from foreclosure sales not within the control of the taxpayer are not within the evil aimed at by the 1934 Act, they must be deemed to be excluded from the reach of its language. To support this contention respondents rely on the report of the Ways and Means Committee submitting to the House the bill which, with amendments not now material, became the Revenue Act of 1934. The Committee in pointing out a 'defect' of the existing law said: 'Taxpayers take their losses within the two year period and get full benefit therefrom and delay taking gains until the two-year period has expired, thereby reducing their taxes.' H. Rept. 704, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 9 and 10.\n But the treatment of gains and losses from sales of capital assets on a different basis from ordinary gains and losses was not introduced into the revenue laws by the 1934 Act. That had been a feature of every revenue \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n law beginning with the Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, and each had defined as capital losses 'losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets'. The 1934 Act made no change in this respect but for the first time it provided that 'capital assets' should include all property acquired by the taxpayer for profit regardless of the length of time held by him and that capital gains and losses from sales of capital assets should be recognized in the computation of taxable income according to the length of time the capital assets are held by the taxpayer, varying from 100% if the capital asset is held for not more than a year to 30% if it is held more than ten years.  117(a). Finally, for the first time, the statute provided that capital losses in excess of capital gains should be deducted from ordinary income only to the extent of $2,000. Thus by treating all property acquired by the taxpayer for profit as capital assets and limiting the deduction of capital losses in the manner indicated, the Act materially curtailed the advantages which the taxpayer had previously been able to gain by choosing the time of selling his property.\n The definition of capital losses as losses from 'sales' of capital assets, as we have pointed out, was not new. As will presently appear, the legislative history of this definition shows that it was not chosen to exclude from the capital assets provisions losses resulting from forced sales of taxpayers' property. And, if so construed, substantial loss of revenue would result under the 1934 Act, whose purpose was to avoid loss of revenue by the application of the capital assets provisions. In drafting the 1934 Act the Committee had before it proposals for stabilizing the revenue by the adoption of the British system under which neither capital gains nor losses enter into the computation of the tax. In declining to follow this system in its entirety the Committee said: 'It is deemed wiser to attempt a step in this direction without \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 509]\n\u00a0\n letting capital gains go entirely untaxed'. It accordingly reduced the tax burden on capital gains progressively with the increase of the period up to ten years, during which the taxpayer holds the capital asset, and permitted the deduction, on the same scale, of capital losses, but only to the extent that there are taxable capital gains, plus $2,000. In thus relieving capital gains from the tax imposed on other types of income, it cannot be assumed, in the absence of some clear indication to the contrary, that Congress intended to permit deductions in full of losses resulting from forced sales of the taxpayers' property, from either capital gains or ordinary gross income, while taxing only a fraction of the gains resulting from the sales of such property. See White v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 281, 292\n, 59 S.Ct. 179, 184; Helvering v. Inter-Mountain Life Ins. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 686, 689\n, 690 S., 55 S.Ct. 572, 574\n\n\n The taxation of capital gains after deduction of capital losses on a more favorable basis than other income, was provided for by  206 of the 1921 Revenue Act, as the means of encouraging profit-taking sales of capital investments, H. Rept. No. 350, 67th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 75. In this section, as in later Acts, capital net gain was defined as 'the excess of the total ... capital gain over the sum of the capital deductions and capital losses'; capital losses being defined as the loss resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets. In submitting the proposed Revenue Act of 1924, the House committee pointed out that the 1921 Act contained no provision for limiting deduction of capital losses where they exceeded the amount of capital gains. H. Rept. No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 14. This was remedied by providing in  208(c) that the amount by which the tax is reduced on account of a capital loss shall not exceed 12 1\/2% of the capital loss. In commenting on this provision the Committee said, p. 10: 'If the amount by which the tax is to be increased on account of capital gains is limited to 12 1\/2% of the capital gain \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n it follows logically that the amount by which the tax is reduced on account of capital losses shall be limited to the 12 1\/2% of the loss.' This provision was continued without changes now material until the 1934 Act.  208(c) in the 1924 and 1926 Acts;  101(b) in the 1928 and 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 191, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 504.\n Congress thus has given clear indication of a purpose to offset capital gains by losses from the sale of like property and upon the same percentage basis as that on which the gains are taxed. See United States v. Pleasants, \n305 \nU.S. 357, 360\n, 59 S.Ct. 281, 283. This purpose to treat gains and deductible losses on a parity but with a further specific provision provided by  117(d) of the 1934 Act, permitting specified percentages of capital losses to be deducted from ordinary income to the extent of $2,000, would be defeated in a most substantial way if only a percentage of the gains were taxed but losses on sales of like property could be deducted in full from gross income. This treatment of losses from sales of capital assets in the 1924 and later Acts and the reason given for adopting it afford convincing evidence that the 'sales' referred to in the statute include forced sales such as have sufficed, under long accepted income tax practice, to establish a deductible loss in the case of non-capital assets. Such sales can equally be taken to establish the loss in the case of capital assets without infringing the declared policy of the statute to treat capital gains and losses on a parity.\n We can find no basis in the language of the Act, its purpose or its legislative history, for saying that losses from sales of capital assets under the 1934 Act, more than its predecessors, were to be treated any differently whether they resulted from forced sales of voluntary sales. True, courts in the interpretation of a statute have some scope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or usual meaning of its words where acceptance of that meaning would lead to absurd results, United \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 511]\n\u00a0\n States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 46 S.Ct. 513, 516, or would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute, Haggar Co. v. Helvering, \n308 \nU.S. 389\n, 60 S.Ct. 337. But courts are not free to reject that meaning where no such consequences follow and where, as here, it appears to be consonant with the purposes of the Act as declared by Congress and plainly disclosed by its structure.\n It is not without significance that Congress in the 1934 Act, enlarged the scope of its provisions relating to losses from sales of capital assets by including within them losses upon the disposition of the taxpayer's property by methods other than sale and without reference to the voluntary action of the taxpayer. It thus treats as losses from sales or exchanges the loss sustained from redemption of stock,  115(c), retirement of bonds,  117(f), losses from short sales,  117(e)(1), and loss sustained by failure of the holder of an option to exercise it,  117( e)(2), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 703, 708, although none of these transactions involves a loss from a sale. See McClain v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n311 \nU.S. 527\n, 61 S.Ct. 373, decided this day.\n The scope of the capital loss provisions was still further enlarged by  23(k) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 447, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  23(k) (2), which provides that if securities, which are capital assets, are ascertained to be worthless and are charged off within the taxable year the loss, with an exception not now material, shall be considered as a loss arising from a sale or exchange. These provisions disclose a consistent legislative policy to enlarge the class of deductible losses made subject to the capital assets provisions without regard to the voluntary action of the taxpayer in producing them. We could hardly suppose that Congress would not have made provision for the like treatment of losses resulting from a forced sale of the taxpayer's property acquired for profit either in the 1934 or 1938 Act, if it had thought that the term 'sales or exchanges' as used in both acts did not include such sales of the taxpayer's property. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n Respondents also advance the argument, sustained in Commissioner v. Freihofer, 3 Cir., 102 F.2d 787, 125 A.L.R. 761, that the definitive event fixing respondents' loss was not the foreclosure sale but the decree of foreclosure which ordered the sale and preceded it. But since the foreclosure contemplated by the decree was foreclosure by sale and the foreclosed property had value which was conclusively established by the sale for the purposes of the foreclosure proceeding, the sale was the definitive event establishing the loss within the meaning and for the purpose of the revenue laws. They are designed for application to the practical affairs of men. The sale, which finally cuts off the interest of the mortgagor and is the means for determining the amount of the deficiency judgment against him is a means adopted by the statute for determining the amount of his capital gain or loss from the sale of the mortgaged property.\n The court below also thought that the loss suffered by respondents could not be treated as a loss from a sale since by the law of Michigan the vendor upon a landcontract containing the usual forfeiture clause had the right to deprive respondents and their joint adventurers of all interest in the property by a declaration of forfeiture, and that the only additional advantage of foreclosure was to obtain a deficiency judgment. But there is nothing in this record to show that the land contract in this case contained a forfeiture clause. Even if it did, it does not appear that there was in fact a forfeiture apart from the sale on foreclosure. Cf. Davidson v. Commissioner, \n305 \nU.S. 44, 46\n, 59 S.Ct. 43, 44; Helvering v.

Harkrider and T. W. Lain, both of Galveston, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petition for certiorari presents the single question whether under  504(b) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 169, 247, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 585, the donor of property in trust for the benefit of numerous beneficiaries is entitled to a single gift tax exemption or exclusion to the extent of the first $5,000 or to separate exemptions of $5,000 for each beneficiary.\n Sections 501(a), 502(1), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 580, impose for each callendar year a tax on the net amount of the transfers 'by any individual ... of property by gift'. By  501(b) the tax applies 'whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise' and 'whether the gift is direct or indirect'. In the computation of the tax laid upon 'net gifts' made during the calendar year,  504(b) provides 'In the case of gifts ( other than of future interests in property) made to any person by the donor during the calendar year, the first $5,000 of such gifts ... shall not ... be included in the total amount of gifts made during such year'. And  1111, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, p. 656, defining generally terms used throughout the Revenue Act, provides: '(a) When used in this Act-(1) The term 'person' means an individual, a trust or estate, a partnership, or a corporation.'\n On December 30, 1935, the taxpayer executed a trust indenture by which she transferred, in trust, property of a value of approximately $145, 000 for a term ending in 1957, unless sooner terminated by the trustees, for the benefit of her seven children, with gifts over of the share of each child in event of the death of that child before the expiration of the trust. The taxpayer in her gift tax return for 1935 excluded from the taxable amount of her gifts the sum of $5,000 for each child or a total of $ 35,000. The commissioner allowed only a single deduction of $5,000 in lieu of the seven $5,000 deductions claimed by the taxpayer and assessed a deficiency accordingly. The Board of Tax Appeals, treating the trust as the donee rather than the individual beneficiaries, sustained the commissioner's assessment. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 111 F.2d 229. We granted certiorari October 28, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 638\n, 61 S.Ct. 73, 85 L.Ed. --, to resolve a conflict \n\n[312 \nU.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n of the decision below and of like decisions in other circuits. Welch v. Davidson, 1 Cir., 102 F.2d 100; Rheinstrom v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 105 F. 2d 642, 124 A.L.R. 861; McBrier v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 108 F.2d 967, and in the Court of Claims, Pelzer v. United States, 31 F.Supp. 770, with that of the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Ryerson, 114 F.2d 150.\n It is not doubted that separate gifts, other than of future interests, made directly to the donees without the intervention of a trustee entitle the donor under  504(b), to one $5,000 exclusion for each gift. But the Government argues that here the trustee or the trust is the donee and as there was only a single trust there can be only a single statutory deduction from the total amount of the gifts. As the statute allows one deduction of the first $5,000 for each gift 'made to any person' by the donor, the question for decision is whether in this case of a gift in trust for the benefit of the designated beneficiaries the single trust, or each beneficiary, is the 'person' to whom the gift was made and for which the deduction is allowed.\n The statutory definition of 'person' in  1111(a)(1) is of little aid in answering this question. The definition is made generally applicable to all of the sections of the revenue act and was carried forward from earlier acts which contained on gift tax provisions. See  2(a)(1) of the 1926 Revenue Act, 44 Stat. 9, and  701(a)(1) of the 1928 Revenue Act, 45 Stat. 878, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 145 and page 466. The section means no more than that the word 'person' in any section of the act in which it occurs may be taken as meaning 'trust' rather than 'individual' as the context may require. But  504(b), allowing the deduction in the case of each gift to any person when applied to gifts in trust for designated beneficiaries, may be read as referring either to a gift to the trust or a gift to each individual beneficiary. Hence we must read the section in its setting of the gift tax pro- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n visions and in the light of its legislative history, to determine whether, within its meaning, the trust or each individual beneficiary is the donee to whom the gift is made.\n The gift tax provisions are not concerned with mere transfers of legal title to the trustee without surrender by the donor of the economic benefits of ownership and his control over them. A gift to a trustee reserving to the donor the economic benefit of the trust or the power of its disposition, involves no taxable gift. It is only upon the surrender by the donor of the benefit or power reserved to himself that a taxable gift occurs. Sanford's Estate v. Commissioner, \n308 \nU.S. 39\n, 60 S.Ct. 51; Rasquin v. Humphreys, \n308 \nU.S. 54\n, 60 S.Ct. 60, and it would seem to follow that the beneficiary of the trust to whose benefit the surrender inures, whether made at the time the trust is created or later, is the 'person' or 'individual' to whom the gift is made.\n But for present purposes it is of more importance that in common understanding and in the common use of language a gift is made to him upon whom the donor bestows the benefit of his donation. One does not speak of making a gift to a trust rather than to his children who are its beneficiaries. The reports of the committees of Congress used words in their natural sense and in the sense in which we must take it they were intended to be used in  504(b) when, in discussing  501, they spoke of the beneficiary of a gift upon trust as the person to whom the gift is made. Similarly they spoke of gifts effected by transfer of money or property to another as consideration for the payment of money or other property to a third person as a gift to the third person. H. Rept. No. 708, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 27-28; S. Rept. No. 665, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 39-40. It is of some significance also that the denial by  504(b) of the exemption in the case of gifts of 'future interests' has little scope for practical operation unless the gifts to which the exemption applies \n\n[312 \nU.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n include those gifts made to beneficiaries of a trust since it is by resort to the conveyance in trust that most future interests are created.\n Moreover, the very purpose of allowing a gift tax exemption measured by the number of donees, would be defeated if a distinction were to be taken between gifts made directly to numerous donees and a gift made for their benefit by way of a single trust, and we are unable to discern in the statute or its legislative history any purpose to make such a distinction. While one object of the exemption was to permit small tax free gifts, and at the same time 'to fix the amount sufficiently large to cover in most cases wedding and Christmas gifts' without the necessity of keeping accounts and reporting the gifts, H. Rept. supra, 29; S. Rept. supra, 41, nevertheless the statute extended the exemption in the specified amount to all gifts, whether large or small, 'made to any person'.\n In the face of an exemption thus made broadly applicable to all gifts to all donees and in the absence of some indication of an intention to discriminate between gifts made directly to the donees and those made indirectly to the beneficiaries of a trust, we can hardly assume a purpose to favor one class of donees over the other or find such a purpose in the words of the statutory definition of 'person' which may indicate either the trust or each individual beneficiary of the trust as the person to whom the gift is made. Further, such an assumption would open the way to avoid the $5,000 limitation upon the allowed exemption, by resort to the simple expedient of the creation by a single donor of any number of trusts of $5,000 each for the benefit of a single beneficiary. \n1\n A \n\n[312 \nU.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n construction so dependent upon an artificial meaning of the words of the statute and so our of harmony with the statutory scheme and purpose is not to be favored.\n Article 11 of 79 Treasury Regulations (1933 edition), issued under the 1932 Act treats each gift to the beneficiary of a trust as entitled to the benefit of the $5,000 deduction unless the gift is of a 'future interest' which  504(b) excepts from the exemption otherwise allowed. Such we think is the correct construction of the statute.\n It is unnecessary to consider here the question whether a gift upon trust for impersonal, public or charitable purposes where there are no designated or ascertainable first beneficiaries is a gift to the trust entitled to a single $5,000 deduction. See Hutchings v. Helvering, 5 Cir., 111 F.2d 229, 231. Nor do we consider whether the gifts to the beneficiaries here are of future interests which are excepted from the benefit of the $5,000 deduction allowed by  504(b). That question is not presented by the petition for certiorari. But our judgment will be without prejudice to consideration of that question by the Board of Tax Appeals upon the remand to it if, under the rules and procedure governing proceedings before the Board, the Commissioner is free to present the question there.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It was this construction of the statute by the Board of Tax Appeals and by 'several of the federal courts' which lead to the amendment of  504(b) so as to withdraw the exemption in the case of every gift in trust.

McKenzie, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Less than a month before her death in 1936, decedent, at the age of 80 executed two contracts with the Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. One was an annuity contract in standard form entitling decedent to annual payments of $589.80 as long as she lived. The consideration stated for this contract was $4,179. The other contract was called a 'Single Premium Life Policy-Non Participating' and provided for a payment of $25,000 to decedent's daughter, respondent Le Gierse, at decedent's death. The premium specified was $22,946. Decedent paid the total consideration, $27, 125, at the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n time the contracts were executed. She was not required to pass a physical examination or to answer the questions a woman applicant normally must answer.\n The 'insurance' policy would not have been issued without the annuity contract, but in all formal respects the two were treated as distinct transactions. Neither contract referred to the other. Independent applications were filed for each. Neither premium was computed with reference to the other. Premium payments were reported separately and entered in different accounts on the company's books. Separate reserves were maintained for insurance and annuities. Each contract was in standard form. The 'insurance' policy contained the usual provisions for surrender, assignment, optional modes of settlement, etc.\n Upon decedent's death, the face value of the 'insurance' contract became payable to respondent Le Gierse, the beneficiary. Thereafter, a federal estate tax return was filed which excluded from decedent's gross estate the proceeds of the 'insurance' policy. The Commissioner notified respondents Bankers Trust Co. and Le Gierse, as executors of decedent's estate, that he proposed to include the proceeds of this policy in the gross estate and to assess a deficiency. Suit in the Board of Tax Appeals followed, and the Commissioner's action was reversed. 39 B.T.A. 1134. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir., 110 F.2d 734. We brought the case here because of conflict with Commissioner v. Keller's Estate, 3 Cir., 113 F.2d 833, and Helvering v. Tyler, 8 Cir., 111 F.2d 422. \n311 \nU.S. 625\n, 61 S.Ct. 32, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The ultimate question is whether the 'insurance' proceeds may be included in decedent's gross estate.\n Section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 70, as amended, 47 Stat. 169, 279, 48 Stat. 680, 752, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  811, provides: 'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time \n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible ... (g) To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.' Thus the basic question is whether the amounts received here are amounts 'receivable as insurance' within the meaning of  302(g).\n Conventional aids to construction are of little assistance here. Section 302(g) first appeared in identical language in the Revenue Act of 1918 as  402(f). 40 Stat. 1057, 1098. It has never been changed. \n1\n None of the acts has ever defined 'insurance'. Treasury Regulations, interpreting the original provision, stated simply: 'The term 'insurance' refers to life insurance of every description, including death benefits paid by fraternal beneficial societies, operating under the lodge system.' Treasury Regulations No. 37, 1921 edition, p. 23. This statement has never been amplified. \n2\n The committee report accompanying the Revenue Act of 1918 merely noted that the provision taxing insurance receivable by the executor clarified existing law, and that the provision taxing insurance in excess of $40,000 receivable by specific beneficiaries was inserted to prevent tax evasion. House Report No. 767, 65th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 22.3 Sub- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 539]\n\u00a0\n sequent committee reports do not mention  302(g). Transcripts of committee hearings in 1918 and since are equally uninformative. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Necessarily, then, the language and the apparent purpose of  302(g) are virtually the only bases for determining what Congress intended to bring within the scope of the phrase 'receivable as insurance'. In fact, in using the term 'insurance' Congress has identified the characteristic that determines what transactions are entitled to the partial exemption of  302(g).\n We think the fair import of subsection [g] is that the amounts must be received as the result of a transaction which involved an actual 'insurance risk' at the time the transaction was executed. Historically and commonly insurance involves risk-shifting and risk-distributing. That life insurance is desirable from an economic and social standpoint as a device to shift and distribute risk of loss from premature death is unquestionable. That these elements of risk-shifting and risk-distributing are essential to a life insurance contract is agreed by courts and commentators. See for example: Ritter v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., \n169 \nU.S. 139\n, 18 S.Ct. 300; In re Walsh, D.C., 19 F.Supp. 567; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 16 B.T.A. 314; Ackerman v. Commissioner, 15 B.T.A. 635; Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance, Vol. I,  61; Vance, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 540]\n\u00a0\n Insurance,  1-3; Cooley, Briefs on Insurance, 2d edition, Vol. I, p. 114; Huebner, Life Insurance, Ch. 1. Accordingly, it is logical to assume that when Congress used the words 'receivable as insurance' in  302(g), it contemplated amounts received pursuant to a transaction possessing these features. Commissioner v. Keller, supra; Helvering v. Tyler, supra; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 102 F.2d 380; Ackerman v. Commissioner, supra.\n Analysis of the apparent purpose of the partial exemption granted in  302(g) strengthens the assumption that Congress used the word 'insurance' in its commonly accepted sense. Implicit in this provision is acknowledgement of the fact that usually insurance payable to specific beneficiaries is designed to shift to a group of individuals the risk of premature death of the one upon whom the beneficiaries are dependent for support. Indeed, the pith of the exemption is particular protection of contracts and their proceeds intended to guard against just such a risk. See Commissioner v. Keller, supra; United States Trust Co. v. Sears, D.C., 29 F.Supp. 643; Hughes, Federal Death Tax, p. 91; Comment, 38 Mich.L.Rev. 526, 528; compare Chase National Bank v. United States, D.C., 28 F.Supp. 947; In re Walsh, supra; Moskowitz v. Davis, 6 Cir., 68 F.2d 818. Hence, the next question is whether the transaction in suit in fact involved an 'insurance risk' as outlined above.\n We cannot find such an insurance risk in the contracts between decedent and the insurance company.\n The two contracts must be considered together. To say they are distinct transactions is to ignore actuality, for it is conceded on all sides and was found as a fact by the Board of Tax Appeals that the 'insurance' policy would not have been issued without the annuity contract. Failure, even studious failure, in one contract to refer to the other cannot be controlling. Moreover, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 541]\n\u00a0\n authority for such consideration is not wanting, however unrealistic the distinction between form and substance may be. Commissioner v. Keller, supra; Helvering v. Tyler, supra. See Williston, Contracts, Vol. III,  628; Paul, Studies in Federal Taxation, 2d series, p. 218; compare Pearson v. McGraw, \n308 \nU.S. 313\n, 60 S.Ct. 211.5\n Considered together, the contracts wholly fail to spell out any element of insurance risk. It is true that the 'insurance' contract looks like an insurance policy, contains all the usual provisions of one, and could have been assigned or surrendered without the annuity. Certainly the mere presence of the customary provisions does not create risk, and the fact that the policy could have been assigned is immaterial since no matter who held the policy and the annuity, the two contracts, relating to the life of the one to whom they were originally issued, still counteracted each other. It may well be true that if enough people of decedent's age wanted such a policy it would be issued without the annuity, or that if the instant policy had been surrendered a risk would have arisen. In either event the essential relation between the two parties would be different from what it is here. The fact remains that annuity and insurance are opposites; in this combination the one neutralizes the risk customarily inherent in the other. From the company's viewpoint, insurance looks to longevity, annuity to transiency. See Commissioner v. Keller, supra; Helvering v. Tyler, supra; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, supra; Carroll v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., D.C., 9 F.Supp. 223; Note, 49 Yale L.J. 946; Cohen, Annuities and Transfer Taxes, 7 Kan.B.A.J. 139. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 531, 542]\n\u00a0\n Here the total consideration was prepaid and exceeded the face value of the 'insurance' policy. The excess financed loading and other incidental charges. Any risk that the prepayment would earn less than the amount paid to respondent as an annuity was an investment risk similar to the risk assumed by a bank; it was not an insurance risk as explained above. It follows that the sums payable to a specific beneficiary here are not within the scope of  302(g). The only remaining question is whether they are taxable.\n We hold that they are taxable under  302[c] of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  811(c), as a transfer to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.

LERNER STORES CORPORATION(1941)\nNo. 248\nArgued: December 11, 1941Decided: December 22, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Andrew B. Trudgian, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a companion case to Scaife Co. v. Commissioner, \n314 \nU.S. 459\n, 62 S.Ct. 338, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day. The tax in dispute is respondent's excess profits tax for the fiscal year 1937. Respondent filed a timely capital stock tax return for the first year ended June 30, 1936, in which the declared value of its capital stock was stated to be $25,000. This return was filed September 27, 1936, an extension of time until September 29, 1936, having been obtained. The figure of $25,000 was \n\n[314 \nU.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n erroneous due to a mistake made by an employee of respondent. When the error was discovered an amended return was tendered in which the declared value of the capital stock was given as $2,500,000. This was on January 27, 1937, more than sixty days after the statutory due date. The amount of the tax, penalty and interest on the higher amount was tendered. The amended return was not accepted and the amount of the remittance was refunded. Petitioner, in determining respondent's net income subject to the excess profits tax for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1937, used the declared value of $25,000 appearing in the original return. The order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the Commissioner was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Lerner Stores Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 455.\n On the issue of timeliness of the amended return the decision in the Scalife case is determinative. The case for disallowance of the amendment is even stronger here, for the amended return was filed beyond the period for which any extension could have been granted by the Commissioner. The hardship resulting from the misplaced decimal point is plain. But Congress not the courts is the source of relief.\n Respondent in its brief tenders another issue. It contends here, as it did before the Board and the Circuit Court of Appeals, that  105 and 106 of the Revenue Act of 1935, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 796, 800, constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority contrary to Art. 1, Sec. 8 of the Constitution; that they violate the Fifth Amendment; and that the capital stock and excess profits taxes being 'based on guesses and wagers' are beyond the delegated powers of Congress. The Board and the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled adversely to respondent on these constitutional issues. Respondent filed no cross-petition for certiorari. Yet a respondent, without filing a cross-petition, may urge in support of the judgment under review grounds rejected \n\n[314 \nU.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n by the court below. Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 538\n, 539 S., 51 S.Ct. 243, 246; Public Service Commission of Puerto Rico v. Havemeyer, \n296 \nU.S. 506, 509\n, 56 S.Ct. 360, 361; McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, \n309 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 60 S.Ct. 670, 672, 673.\n The constitutional issues however are without substance. As we noted in Haggar Co. v. Helvering, \n308 \nU.S. 389, 391\n, 392 S., 394, 60 S.Ct. 337, 338- 340, the capital stock tax and the excess profits tax are closely interrelated. The declared value of the capital stock is the basis of computation of both taxes. The declared value for the first year is the value declared by the corporation in its first return; the declared value for subsequent years1 is the original declared value as changed by certain specified capital adjustments. Sec. 105(f), Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 1018. The taxpayer is free to declare any value of the capital stock for the first year which it may choose. While a low declaration of value decreases the amount of the capital stock tax, it increases the risk of a high excess profits tax. On the other hand, a high declaration of value while decreasing the tax on excess profits, increases the capital stock tax. By allowing the taxpayer 'to fix for itself the amount of the taxable base' for purposes of computation of these taxes, Congress 'avoided the necessity of prescribing a formula for arriving at the actual value of capital ...' a problem 'which had been found productive of much litigation under earlier taxing acts'. Haggar Co. v. Helvering, supra, 308 U.S. at page 394, 60 S.Ct. at page 340. See 1 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, pp. 577-594. 'At the same time it guarded against loss of revenue to the Government through understatements of capital' by providing a formula which would in such circumstances result in an increase in the excess profits tax. Haggar Co. v. Helvering, supra, 308 U. S. at page 394, 60 S.Ct. at page 340. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n There is present no unlawful delegation of power. Congress has prescribed the method by which the taxes are to be computed. The taxpayer here is given a choice as to value. While the decision which it makes has a pronounced effect upon its tax liability, that is not uncommon in the tax field. Congress has fixed the criteria in light of which the choice is to be made. The election which the taxpayer makes cannot affect anyone but itself.\n The contention that these provisions of the Act run afoul of the Fifth Amendment is likewise without merit. A claim of unreasonable classification or inequality in the incidence or application of a tax raises no question under the Fifth Amendment which contains no equal protection clause. La Belle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377\n, 41 S.Ct. 528; Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381, 401\n, 60 S.Ct. 907, 916. The propriety or wisdom of a tax on profits computed in reference to a specified criterion of value of capital stock is not open to challenge in the courts. La Belle Iron Works v. United States, supra, 256 U.S., at page 393, 41 S.Ct. 528. That being true there is no constitutional reason why Congress may not because of administrative convenience alone (Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 511\n, 57 S.Ct. 868, 873, 109 A.L.R. 1327 and cases cited) avoid litigious valuation problems and rely on the selfinterest of taxpayers to place a fair valuation on their capital stock. As was stated in Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. v. McGowan, 2 Cir., 115 F. 2d 953, 955, 'To say that Congress could not choose a scheme implemented by such mild sanctions, as an alternative to actually computing an 'excess profits tax' with all the uncertainty and litigation which that had involved, would be most unreason- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n ably to circumscribe its powers to establish a convenient and flexible fiscal system.'\n Nor do we have here any lack of that territorial uniformity which is required by Art. 1,  8, of the Constitution. La Belle Iron Works v. United States, supra, 256 U.S., at page 392, 41 S.Ct. 528.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There is no limitation of time on the use of the original declared value under the 1935 Act. It should be noted, however, that  1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  1202 (see  601(f) of the Revenue Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 447, 566), provides that the 'adjusted declared value shall be determined with respect to three-year periods beginning with the year ending June 30, 1938, and each third year thereafter.' That adjusted declared value enters into the computation of the excess profits tax under  600 and 601 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  660, 601. \n\n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. REYNOLDS(1941)\nNo. 684\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 429]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Thomas I. Emerson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. J. Gilmer Korner, Jr., of Washington, D.C., and Erwin N. Griswold, of Cambridge, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent's father died in 1918, leaving him a remainder interest in a testamentary trust, an interest which the court below found to be contingent under North Carolina law. He received his share of the trust, including securities, from the trustee on April 4, 1934. Some of the securities so distributed had been received by the trustee from the decedent's estate and others had been purchased by the trustee between 1918 and 1934. During the year 1934 respondent sold some of the securities in each group. In computing his gains and losses he used as the basis the value on April 4, 1934, when he received the securities from the trustee. The Commissioner determined that the proper basis under the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 664 et seq., was the value of the securities at the time of decedent's death in the case of those then held by decedent and their cost to the trus- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 430]\n\u00a0\n tee in the case of those which the trustee had purchased. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner. Reynolds v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 41 B.T.A. 59. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 4 Cir., 114 F.2d 804. We granted the petition for certiorari (exclusive of the question whether the remainder was vested or contingent under the law of North Carolina) because of a conflict among the circuits. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Sec. 113(a)(5) of the 1934 Act provided: 'If the property was acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, or by the decedent's estate from the decedent, the basis shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such acquisition.' The government places considerable stress on Maguire v. Commissioner, \n313 \nU.S. 1\n, 61 S.Ct. 789, 85 L.Ed. --; Helvering v. Gambrill, \n313 \nU.S. 11\n, 61 S.Ct. 795, 85 L.Ed. --; and Helvering v. Campbell, \n313 \nU.S. 15\n, 61 S.Ct. 798, 85 L.Ed. --, decided under the 1928 and 1932 Acts, in support of its contention that as respects securities owned by decedent the proper basis was their value at his death even though respondent's interest was then contingent. And it also relies on Treasury Regulations 86, promulgated under the 1934 Act, Art. 113(a)(5)-1(b) of which provided that 'all titles to property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance relate back to the death of the decedent, even though the interest of him who takes the title was, at the date of death of the decedent, legal, equitable, vested, contingent, general, specific, residual, conditional, executory, or otherwise.' Respondent on the other hand urges that the phrase 'at the time of such acquisition' when it was included in the 1934 Act had acquired by construction a definite meaning which excluded contingent remainders and therefore that Congress must be presumed to have used those words in that sense. In that connection he points out that the phrase \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 431]\n\u00a0\n 'at the time of such acquisition' had appeared in the 1921, 1924, and 1926 Acts2 and that certain office decisions of the Treasury, 3 and certain decisions of the lower federal courts4 under those acts, made prior to the enactment of the 1934 Act, had held that a beneficiary did not acquire property when his interest was merely contingent. Respondent emphasize that the legislative history of the 1934 Act shows no mention of the prior administrative and judicial treatment of contingent remainders and makes no complaint with the practice of the bureau or with the decisions. He insists that the words 'acquired' or 'acquisition' are not vague or ambiguous words but mean to obtain 'as one's own', as held in Helvering v. San Joaquin Fruit & Investment Co., \n297 \nU.S. 496, 499\n, 56 S.Ct. 569, 570. By these arguments and related ones respondent seeks to demonstrate that the earlier rule had become embedded in the law so that it could be changed not by administrative rules or regulations but by Congress alone. On the basis of such reasoning and the difference in wording between the 1934 Act and the 1928 and 1932 Acts, he seeks to distinguish the Maguire, Gambrill, and Campbell cases. And since Art. 113( a)(5)-1(b) was promulgated on February 11, 1935, respondent insists that to make it applicable to transactions occurring in 1934 would be to give it a retroactive effect contrary to Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co ., \n306 \nU.S. 110\n, 59 S.Ct. 423.\n Respondent's position is not tenable. We are not dealing here with a situation where the meaning of statutory \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 432]\n\u00a0\n language is resolved by reference to explicit statements of Congressional purpose. Maguire v. Commissioner, supra; Helvering v. Campbell, supra. Here the Committee Reports5 on the 1934 Act are wholly silent as to whether a taxpayer has acquired property within the meaning of  113(a)(5) at a time when he has obtained only a contingent remainder interest. And we need not stop to inquire whether, in absence of the Treasury Regulations under the 1934 Act, the administrative construction of 'acquisition' under the earlier Acts was of such a character (Higgins v. Commissioner, \n312 \nU.S. 212\n, 61 S.Ct. 475, 85 L.Ed. --) and the prior judicial decisions had such consistency and uniformity that Congressional reenactment of the language in question was an adoption of its previous interpretation within the rule of such cases as United States v. Dakota- Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459\n, 53 S.Ct. 435. That rule is no more than an aid in statutory construction. While it is useful at times in resolving statutory ambiguities, it does not mean that the prior construction has become so embedded in the law that only Congress can effect a change. Morrissey v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344, 355\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, 294. And see Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299\n, 53 S.Ct. 161. It gives way before changes in the prior rule or practice through exercise by the administrative agency of its continuing rule-making power. Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., \n308 \nU.S. 90, 100\n, 101 S., 60 S.Ct. 18, 24. Nor is Art. 113(a)(5)-1(b) of the Regulations condemned by Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., supra. That case turned on its own special facts. The transactions there in question took place at a time when a regulation was in force which expressly negatived any tax liability. The regulation remained outsta ding for a long time and was followed by several reenactments of the statute. About five years after the transactions in question took \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 433]\n\u00a0\n place the prior regulation was amended so as to impose a tax liability. There are no such circumstances here. No relevant regulation was in force at the time respondent sold the securities in 1934. The regulation here in question was promulgated under the very Act which determines respondent's liability. The fact that the regulation was not promulgated until after the transactions in question had been consummated is immaterial. Cf. Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, \n297 \nU.S. 129\n, 56 S.Ct. 397. The magnitude of the task of preparing regulations under a new act may well occasion some delay. To hold that respondent had a vested interest in a hypothetical decision in his favor prior to the advent of the regulations would introduce into the scheme of the Revenue Acts refined notions of statutory construction which would, to say the least, impair an important administrative responsibility in the tax collecting process.\n Hence the regulation governs this case if the word 'acquisition' as used in  113(a)(5) was susceptible of this administrative interpretation. We think it was. However unambiguous that word might be as respects other transactions (Helvering v. San Joaquin Fruit & Investment Co., supra) its meaning in this statutory setting was far from clear as respects property passing by bequest, devise, or inheritance. The definition of 'acquisition' contained in the regulation is not a strained or artificial one. Admittedly the date of death would be the proper basis if respondent's interest under the testamentary trust had been a vested remainder. But even a vested remainderman does not have all of the attributes of ownership. So the test in this type of case is not whether respondent had full enjoyment of the property prior to the delivery of the securities to him but whether he earlier had acquired an interest which ultimately ripened into complete ownership. Respondent has become the taxpayer because he has obtained full ownership of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 434]\n\u00a0\n the property and has sold it. The tax is on gains, if any, realized by him in that transaction. Hence, as we indicated in the Maguire and Campbell cases, to carry into that computation the value of the property at the time the taxpayer had only a contingent remainder interest in it is not to tax him on values which he never received. The statute as thus interpreted 'merely provides a rule of thumb in alleviation of a tax which would be computed by reference to the entire amount of the original inheritance were it to be based on cost to the taxpayer.' Helvering v. Campbell, supra, 313 U.S. at page 22, 61 S.Ct. at page 802, 85 L.Ed. --. As stated by Judge Arant in Augustus v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 118 F.2d 38, 43, the regulation was an 'apt interpretation to make this part of the statute fit efficiently and consistently into the scheme of the revenue system as a whole.' See Maguire v. Commissioner, supra.\n Respondent's suggestion that the regulation does not cover this case will not stand analysis. It has a broad sweep and embraces all interests which have their origin in a bequest, devise, or inheritance.\n For the reasons stated, the proper basis as to the securities owned by the decedent was their value at his death.\n There remains the question as to the proper basis for securities purchased by the trustee. In the Maguire case we held that 'cost' was the proper basis as provided in  113(a) of the 1928 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 380, since securities purchased by a trustee were not 'acquired ... by will' within the meaning of  113(a)(5) of that Act. While  113( a)(5) of the 1934 Act substitutes 'acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance' for 'acquired either by will or by intestacy' in the 1928 Act, that change does not call for a result different from that rea hed in the Maguire case. For the reasons there stated, we hold that as respects securities purchased by the trustee the proper basis is the cost to him. That makes it unnecessary to examine the validity of the holding of the court below that Art. 113(a)(5)- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 435]\n\u00a0\n 1(d) of the Regulations6 is inapplicable because decedent did not die before March 1, 1913\n\n\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n I disagreed with the decisions of the Court in Maguire v. Commissioner, \n313 \nU.S. 1\n, 61 S.Ct. 789, 85 L.Ed. --, Helvering v. Richard Van Nest Gambrill, \n313 \nU.S. 11\n, 61 S.Ct. 795, 85 L.Ed. --, and Helvering v. Campbell et al., \n313 \nU.S. 15\n, 61 S.Ct. 798, 85 L.Ed. --, construing the meaning of the phrase 'time of the distribution to the taxpayer', as used in  113(a)(5) of the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 1932. My dissent was bottomed upon the view that to construe that phrase as meaning the time of the distribution to a trustee, in a case where the taxpayer could neither receive nor enjoy the property, was to disregard the unambiguous words of the statute. I recognize the binding force of those decisions but think that the Court's disposition of the present cases constitutes an even looser and less admissible construction, amounting, in effect, to legislation.\n In all the revenue acts from that of 1921 to that of 1926, inclusive, the cognate provision was that if the property was acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, or by the decedent's estate from the decedent, the basis should be the fair market value of such property at the time of such acquisition. In the revenue act of 1928 a new provision was substituted making the basis in the case of a general or a specific devise or of intestacy the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 436]\n\u00a0\n fair market value at the time of the death of the decedent. The same basis was provided if property was acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent. In all other cases, if the property was acquired by will or by intestacy, the basis was made value at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer. The language was retained in the Act of 1932. In the revenue act of 1934,  113(a)(5) was again cast in the exact language in which the cognate sections had appeared in all the acts prior to that of 1928.\n The meaning of the provision is plain. What Congress was dealing with was the 'property'. It did not specify a right inchoate or otherwise, or an interest less than ownership, but used the colloquial term 'property'. And Congress employed a word in common and ordinary use and not a technical expression of conveyancers when it spoke of the time of 'acquisition' of the property. Anyone reading the sentence would be justified in concluding that if he sold property which came to him from a decedent's estate he must take as his basis of value the market value as of the date when he became the owner of the property; when he became able to enjoy it and dispose of it at his will.\n The present decision finds that Congress did not intend any such thing; that, on the contrary, by a circumlocution, it meant that the taxpayer must take as his basis the fair value at the date of the decedent's death if his ultimate acquisition of the property is traceable to a decedent's will. Thus, though he had no use or benefit of the property, could not dispose of it, and might never enjoy it, he is to be treated as having acquired it.\n A contrary conclusion is required by Helvering v. San Joaquin Fruit & Investment Co., \n297 \nU.S. 496\n, 56 S.Ct. 569. There the Court, in applying the same section here involved, held that the term 'acquired' was not a word of art; and though the acquisition had its origin in an option which \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 437]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer exercised, as here the acquisition had its origin in a will, agreed with the Government's contention that the time of full enjoyment as one's own is the date of acquisition, not the time of obtaining some inchoate interest which may or may not ripen into ownership.\n But if there were doubt as to the meaning of Congress, the legislative history should preclude the strained construction now adopted. In the Maguire and related cases administrative construction and legislative history were meagre and inconclusive. Here violence must be done to a substantial volume of such aids to construction to reach the announced result.\n In 1920 the Treasury ruled that 'Where in a bequest of property the remaindermen have only a contingent interest prior to the death of the life tenant, the basis for determining gain or loss from a sale of such property by the remaindermen is its value as of the date of death of the life tenant.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n There is no dispute that between 1920 and 1935 the Treasury uniformly so interpreted the statutory provision now otherwise construed. In 1930 this Court held that in the case of a residuary legatee whose property rights attached at the moment of death, and who was in contemplation of law and in fact the owner of the property bequeathed to him from the date of death, the time of acquisition was the date of death. \n2\n The decision obviously did not touch a situation such as that disclosed in the present cases and the Treasury so understood. In 1932 the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue rendered an exhaustive opinion in which he referred to, and analyzed, our decision and summarized the administrative practice by saying: '... the position of this office has been that one who has a mere contingent interest does not 'acquire' the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 438]\n\u00a0\n property in question until his interest becomes vested. (O.D. 727, C.B. 3, 53; S.M. 4640, C.B. V-1, 60.) See also I.T. 1622, C.B. II-1, 135; S.O. 35, C.B. 3, 50.' The judicial construction was uniform to the same effect. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n That the Treasury thought the distinction between the acquisition date of vested and contingent interests improper is attested by the fact that in its briefs on applications for certiorari in several of the cases cited in Note 4 it so stated; and in the Pringle case it strenuously contended for a reversal of the judgment on that ground. In its brief in support of its petition for certiorari in the San Joaquin case, supra, which arose under the very section now in question, the Government said: 'It is quite generally recognized that the holder of a contingent estate in property does not acquire the same within the meaning of the revenue acts until the estate becomes vested.' (Citing several of the cases found in the note.) Of course that statement supported the position of the Government in that case. But a new view has apparently emerged, which better serves the Government's interest here.\n It seems plain that when, in 1934, Congress decided to re-adopt the language used in the revenue acts from 1921 to 1926, inclusive, it should be taken as having adopted it not only with a sense of its plain meaning but with a recognition of its uniform interpretation. We are not left, however, ithout light shed by the legislative history and that history furnishes confirmation of the view that Congress did not intend to give any strained, extraordinary, or unusual meaning to its language or to disregard its accepted significance.\n The revenue acts have always treated estates as taxpayers for purposes of income tax. From the adoption of the revenue act of 1918 the Treasury Regulations \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 439]\n\u00a0\n uniformly provided that if an executor sold estate property he must take as a basis the value of the property at the time of the decedent's death for calculating taxable gain. \n4\n The Treasury treated the estate's time of acquisition as the date of the decedent's death within the meaning of the sections of the revenue acts from 1921 to 1926. In 1926 the Court of Claims held that when Congress used the terms 'acquired' and 'acquisition' it meant that the executor might take, as the basis date, the date of acquisition by the decedent. \n5\n This decision upset the uniform practice of the Treasury and required an amendment of the regulations to conform to it. Congress was confronted with this situation when it came to pass the revenue act of 1928. The history of what happened in this respect is most enlightening. The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue, in its report,6 referred to the difficulty created by the McKinney decision, and the doubt the decision had thrown on the meaning of acquisition, and stated, with respect to the proposed section: 'The 'date of death' is recommended to make the basis certain and definite.' The Ways and Means Committee also rendered a report to accompany that of the Joint Committee. In this it said:7 'It is believed that the basis should be the value of the property on the date of the decedent's death, and this rule is incorporated in section 113(a)(5).' It continued: 'It is also provided, in the same paragraph, that the basis in case of a sale by a beneficiary shall be the value of the property on the date of the decedent's death.' (Italics supplied.)\n It is thus abundantly clear that Congress knew how to write a statute to accomplish what the opinion of the Court holds totally different language accomplishes. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 440]\n\u00a0\n The Senate Committee on Finance rewrote the subsection as embodied in the House Bill, altering it to read as it does in the Revenue Act of 1928. 8 This was the section which was construed in Maguire v. Commissioner and related cases. \n9\n It thus appears that Congress rejected the verbiage intended to specify the date of the decedent's death as the basis date to be taken by a beneficiary under the decedent's will.\n With this background Congress, in adopting the 1934 act, discarded the various basis dates prescribed by the Acts of 1928 and 1932 and harked back to the language which had been used in earlier revenue acts which had uniformly been construed by the Treasury to mean that the basis date was the date when the taxpayer actually acquired as his own the property whose disposition gave rise to a taxable gain or a deductible loss. The reason for the change, as shown by the Committee Reports on the revenue act of 1934, was not a desire to alter the settled administrative construction of the phrase 'time of acquisition' but to do away with the diversity between the basis dates for real and personal property which had been created by the provisions of the 1928 and the 1932 acts. No other purpose is shown by the reports. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Regulations 86 were approved by the Secretary of the Treasury February 11, 1935, and were later promulgated as applicable to the Act of 1934. By these regulations it is provided: 'Pursuant to this rule of law, ( i.e. the doctrine of relation) section 113(a)(5) prescribes a single uniform basis rule applicable to all property passing from a decedent by will or under the law governing the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 428, 441]\n\u00a0\n descent and distribution of the property of decedents. Accordingly, the time of acquisition of such property is the death of the decedent, and its basis is the fair market value at the time of the decedent's death, regardless of the time when the taxpayer comes into possession and enjoyment of the property.' It is upon this regulation that the Court relies to justify its construction of the statute.\n I think the regulation plainly unjustified as an attempt on the part of the Treasury to legislate when Congress has failed to do so. The hearings on the revenue act of 1934 show that the Treasury was not satisfied with the provision the Committee recommended Congress should adopt and which Congress did adopt. It evidently attempted to rewrite the Congressional language to carry out what it thought Congress should have provided. It needs no citation of authority to demonstrate that such is not the function of a regulation and that the attempt should fail.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Opposed to the decision below are Van Vranken v.

At the end of five years, or earlier if the beneficiary consented, the securities were to be transferred back to the taxpayer. The Board of Tax Appeals held that the grantor was not \n\n[312 \nU.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n taxable with respect to the income from the trust. Two questions are presented:\n\n'1. Whether, by invoking the general gross income provisions of Section 22, the Commissioner had so changed the theory of the Government's case on appeal as to preclude the Circuit Court of Appeals from considering the issue.\n\n'2. Whether, on the merits, the trust income was taxable as income of the grantor under Section 22.'\n\n In view of the limited grant of certiorari, the second question is not before us.

WILLIAM FLACCUS OAK LEATHER CO.(1941)\nNo. 627\nArgued: April 3, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 247, 248]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. John A. McCann, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In September, 1935, respondent's plant was destroyed by fire. Later that year it received $73,132.50 from an insurance company as compensation for the loss of buildings, machinery, and equipment. The buildings, machinery, and equipment had been fully depreciated for income tax purposes prior to 1935, and no part of the insurance proceeds was used to acquire other property similar or related in service or use to the property destroyed, or to acquire control of a corporation owning such property, or to establish a fund to replace the property destroyed.\n In its return for 1935, respondent reported the insurance proceeds as capital gain and added to that amount a gain, not in issue here, of $862. 50 from sales of securities. During that same year, respondent had capital losses, also not in dispute, of $76,767.62 which it used to offset completely the total reported capital gains of $73,995. This left an excess of capital losses over capital gains of $2,772.62, and respondent deducted $2,000 of that amount from ordinary income.\n The Commissioner held that the insurance proceeds were ordinary income rather than capital gain. Accordingly, he decreased respondent's capital gain and increased its ordinary income by $73,132.50, and allowed respondent capital losses of only $2,862.50, an amount equal to the gain from security sales plus $2,000. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed in a memorandum opinion on the authority of Estate of Herder v. Com'r, 36 B.T.A. 934. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 247, 249]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 3 Cir., 114 F.2d 783. We granted certiorari on February 10, 1941, \n312 \nU.S. 671\n, 61 S.Ct. 620, 85 L.Ed. --, because the decision below was in conflict with Herder v. Helvering, 70 App.D.C. 287, 106 F.2d 153.\n It is conceded that respondent's losses resulted from sales or exchanges of capital assets. It is also conceded that the entire amount received from the insurance company must be included in respondent's income since the property had been fully depreciated for income tax purposes prior to 1935. Respondent contends, however, that that amount may be reported as capital gain, in order that capital losses may absorb it, rather than as an item of ordinary gross income.\n Section 117(d) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 708, provides in part: 'Losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the extent of $2,000 plus the gains from such sales or exchanges.' Thus, the single question is whether the amount respondent received from the insurance company derived from the 'sale or exchange' of a capital asset.\n Generally speaking, the language in the Revenue Act, just as in any statute, is to be given its ordinary meaning, and the words 'sale' and 'exchange' are not to be read any differently. Compare Helvering v. Hammel, \n311 \nU.S. 504\n, 61 S.Ct. 368, 131 A.L.R. 1481; Fairbanks v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 436\n, 59 S.Ct. 607; Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 74. Neither term is appropriate to characterize the demolition of property and subsequent compensation for its loss by an insurance company. Plainly that pair of events was not a sale. Nor can they be regarded as an exchange, for 'exchange', as used in  117(d), implies reciprocal transfers of capital assets, not a single transfer to compensate for the destruction of the transferee's asset.\n The fact that  112(f), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 695, characterizes destruction of property and indemnification for its loss as an involuntary conversion does not establish that the two events constituted a sale or exchange. That section provides: 'If \n\n[313 \nU.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft or seizure, or an exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation, or the threat or imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or into money which is forthwith in good faith, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, expended in the acquisition of other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, or in the establishment of a replacement fund, no gain or loss shall be recognized. If any part of the money is not so expended, the gain, if any ,  all be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the money which is not so expended.'\n We can find nothing in this language or in other sections of the Act which indicates, either expressly or by implication, that Congress intended to classify as 'sales or exchanges' the involuntary conversions enumerated in  112(f). It is true that  111(c), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 692, says that 'in the case of a sale or exchange, the extent to which the gain or loss ... shall be recognized ... shall be determined under the provisions of section 112'. It is also true that  112(f) follows  112(a) which provides that 'upon the sale or exchange of property the entire amount of the gain or loss ... shall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section'.\n The inference, drawn from the juxtaposition and cross referencing of these three sections, that the involuntary conversion of respondent's property is thus implicitly characterized as a sale or exchange ignores the fact that in the same Act Congress has chosen a particular method for classifying as sales or exchanges transactions which would not ordinarily be described by one of those terms. Thus  115(c), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 703, provides: 'Amounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n full payment in exchange for the stock, and amounts distributed in partial liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in part or full payment in exchange for the stock.'\n Section 117(e), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 708, provides: 'For the purpose of this title-(1) gains or losses from short sales of property shall be considered as gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets; and (2) gains or losses attributable to the failure to exercise privileges or options to buy or sell property shall be considered as gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets held for one year or less.' See H.Rep. No. 704, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 31; H.Rep. No. 1385, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 23. Section 117(f), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 708, provides: 'For the purposes of this title, amounts received by the holder upon the retirement of bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates or other evidences of indebtedness issued by any corporation ... with interest coupons or in registered form, shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor.' See McClain v. Commissioner, \n311 \nU.S. 527\n, 61 S.Ct. 373, Fairbanks v. United States, supra; H.Rep. No. 704, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 31.\n These sections demonstrate that Congress has expressly specified the ambiguous transactions which are to be regarded as sales or exchanges for income tax purposes. They are convincing evidence that the involuntary conversion of respondent's property, which bears far less resemblance to a sale or exchange than the transactions embraced in  115(c), 117(e), and 117(f) is not to be placed in one or the other of those categories by implication. The prompt withdrawal of Article 113(a)(9)(1) of Treasury Regulations No. 86 (see T.D. 4698, XV-2 Cum.Bull. 159) indicates that the administrators charged with the enforcement of  112(f) reached a similar conclusion. Compare Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., \n285 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 52 S.

For the tax years in question, 1932 and 1933, he claimed the salaries and expenses incident to looking after his properties were deductible under Section 23(a) of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n the Revenue Act of 1932.1 The Commissioner refused the deductions. The applicable phrases are: 'In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions: (a) Expenses. ... All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business ....' There is no dispute over whether the claimed deductions are ordinary and necessary expenses. As the Commissioner also conceded before the Board of Tax Appeals that the real estate activities of the petitioner in renting buildings2 constituted a business, the Board allowed such portions of the claimed deductions as were fairly allocable to the handling of the real estate. The same offices and staffs handled both real estate and security matters. After this adjustment there remained for the year 1932 over twenty and for the year 1933 over sixteen thousand dollars expended for managing the stocks and bonds.\n Petitioner's financial affairs were conducted through his New York office pursuant to his personal detailed instructions. His residence was in Paris, France, where he had a second office. By cable, telephone and mail, petitioner kept a watchful eye over his securities. While he sought permanent investments, changes, redemptions, maturities and accumulations caused limited shiftings in his portfolio. These were made under his own orders. The offices kept records, received securities, interest and dividend checks, made deposits, forwarded weekly and annual reports and undertook generally the care of the investments as instructed by the owner. Purchases were made by a financial institution. Petitioner did not participate directly or indirectly in the management of the corporations in which he held stock or bonds. The method of handling his affairs under examination had been employed by petitioner for more than thirty years. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n No objection to the deductions had previously been made by the Government.\n The Board of Tax Appeals3 held that these activities did not constitute carrying on a business and that the expenses were capable of apportionment between the real estate and the investments. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,4 and we granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 626\n, 61 S. Ct. 34, 85 L.Ed. --, because of conflict. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner urges that the 'elements of continuity, constant repetition, regularity and extent' differentiate his activities from the occasional like actions of the small investor. His activity is and the occasional action is not 'carrying on business.' On the other hand, the respondent urges that 'mere personal investment activities never constitute carrying on a trade or business, no matter how much of one's time or of one's employees' time they may occupy.'\n Since the first income tax act, the provisions authorizing business deductions have varied only slightly. The Revenue Act of 19136 allowed as a deduction 'the necessary expenses actually paid in carrying on any business.' By 1918 the present form was fixed and has so continued. \n7\n No regulation has ever been promulgated which interprets the meaning of 'carrying on a business,' nor any rulings approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, i.e., Treasury Decisions. \n8\n Certain rulings of less dignity, favorable to petitioner,9 appeared in individual cases but \n\n[312 \nU.S. 212, 216]\n\u00a0\n they are not determinative. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Even acquiescence11 in some Board rulings after defeat does not amount to settled administrative practice. \n12\n Unless the administratives practice is long continued and substantially uniform in the Bureau and without challenge by the Government in the Board and courts, it should not be assumed, from rulings of this class, that Congressional reenactment of the language which they construed was an adoption of their interpretation.\n While the Commissioner has combated views similar to petitioner's in the courts, sometimes successfully13 and sometimes unsuccessfully,14 the petitioner urges that the Bureau accepted for years the doctrine that the management of one's own securities might be a business where there was sufficient extent, continuity, variety and regularity. We fail to find such a fixed administrative construction in the examples cited. It is true that the decisions are frequently put on the ground that the taxpayer's activities were sporadic but it does not follow that had those activities been continuous the Commissioner would not have used the argument advanced here, i.e., that no amount of personal investment management would turn those activities into a business. Evidently such was the Government's contention in the Kales \n\n[312 \nU.S. 212, 217]\n\u00a0\n case, 15 where the things the taxpayer did met petitioner's tests, and in Foss v. Commissioner16 and Washburn v. Commissioner17 where the opinions turned on the extent of the taxpayer's participation in the management of the corporations in which investments were held. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner relies strongly on the definition of business in Flint v. Stone Tracy Company:19 \"Business' is a very comprehensive term and embraces everything about which a person can be employed.' This definition was given in considering whether certain corporations came under the Corporation Tax law which levies a tax on corporations engaged in business. The immediate issue was whether corporations engaged principally in the 'holding and management of real estate'20 were subject to the act. A definition given for such an issue is not controlling in this dissimilar inquiry. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n To determine whether the activities of a taxpayer are 'carrying on a business' requires an examination of the facts in each case. As the Circuit Court of Appeals observed, all expenses of every business transaction are not deductible. Only those are deductible which relate to carrying on a business. The Bureau of Internal Revenue has this duty of determining what is carrying on a business, subject to reexamination of the facts by the Board of Tax Appeals22 and ultimately to review on the law by the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 212, 218]\n\u00a0\n courts on which jurisdiction is conferred. \n23\n The Commissioner and the Board appraised the evidence here as insufficient to establish petitioner's activities as those of carrying on a business. The petitioner merely kept records and collected interest and dividends from his securities, through managerial attention for his investments. No matter how large the estate or how continuous or extended the work required may be, such facts are not sufficient as a matter of law to permit the courts to reverse the decision of the Board. Its conclusion is adequately supported by this record, and rests upon a conception of carrying on business similar to that expressed by this Court for an antecedent section. 24\n The petitioner makes the point that his activities in managing his estate, both realty and personalty, were a unified business. Since it was admittedly a business in so far as the realty is concerned, he urges, there is no statutory authority to sever expenses allocable to the securities. But we see no reason why expenses not attributable, as we have just held these are not, to carrying on business cannot be apportioned. It is not unusual to allocate expenses paid for services partly personal and partly business. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 47 Stat. 169, c. 209, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  23(a). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

DAVIDOWITZ(1941)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: January 20, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William S. Rial, of Greensburg, Pa., M. Louise Rutherford, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Claude T. Reno, of Allentown, Pa., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Isidor Ostroff, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees.\n Francis Biddle, Sol. Gen., for the United States as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 59]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity of an Alien Registration Act adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \n1\n The Act, passed in 1939, requires every alien 18 years or over, with certain exceptions,2 to register once each year; provide such information as is required by the statute, plus any 'other information and details' that the Department of Labor and Industry may direct; pay $1 as an annual registration fee; receive an alien identification card and carry it at all times; show the card whenever it may be demanded by any police officer or any agent of the Department of Labor and Industry; and exhibit the card as a condition precedent to registering a motor vehicle in his name or obtaining a license to operate one. The Department of Labor and Industry is charged with the duties of classifying the registrations for 'the purpose of ready reference', and furnishing a copy of the classification to the Pennsylvania Motor Police. Nonexempt aliens who fail to register are subject to a fine of not \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n more than $100 or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. For failure to carry an identification card or for failure to show it upon proper demand, the punishment is a fine of not more than $10, or imprisonment for not more than 10 dyas, or both.\n A three-judge District Court enjoined enforcement of the Act, holding that it denied aliens equal protection of the laws, and that it encroached upon legislative powers constitutionally vested in the federal government. 3 It is that judgment we are here called upon to review. \n4\n But in 1940, after the court had held that Pennsylvania Act invalid, Congress enacted a federal Alien Registration Act. \n5\n We must therefore pass upon the state Act in the light of the Congressional Act. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The federal Act provides for a single registration of aliens 14 years of age and over; detailed information specified by the Act, plus 'such additional matters as may be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General'; finger-printing of all registrants; and secrecy of the federal files, which can be 'made available only to such persons or agencies as may be designated by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General.' No requirement that aliens carry a registration card to be exhibited to police or \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 61]\n\u00a0\n others is embodied in the law, and only the wilful failure to register is made a criminal offense; punishment is fixed at a fine of not more than $ 1000, imprisonment for not more than 6 months, or both.\n The basic subject of the state and federal laws is identical- registration of aliens as a distinct group. Appellants urge that the Pennsylvania law 'was constitutional when passed', and that 'The only question is whether the state act is in abeyance or whether the state and Federal Government have concurrent jurisdiction to register aliens for the protection of inhabitants and property.' Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the Pennsylvania Act is invalid, for the reasons that it (1) denies equal protection of the laws to aliens residing in the state; (2) violates section 16 of the Civil Rights Act of 1870;7 (3) exceeds Pennsylvania's constitutional power in requiring registration of aliens without Congressional consent. Appellees' final contention is that the power to restrict, limit, regulate and register aliens as a distinct group is not an equal and continuously existing concurrent power of state and nation, but that even if the state can legislate on this subject at all, its power is subordinate to supreme national law. Appellees conclude that by its adoption of a comprehensive, integrated scheme for regulation of aliens-including its 1940 registration act-Congress has precluded state action like that taken by Pennsylvania. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 62]\n\u00a0\n In the view we take it is not necessary to pass upon appellees' first, second, and third contentions, and so we pass immediately to their final question, expressly leaving open all of appellees' other contentions, including the argument that the federal power in this field, whether exercised or unexercised, is exclusive. Obviously the answer to appellees' final question depends upon an analysis of the respective powers of state and national governments in the regulation of aliens as such, and a determination of whether Congress has, by its action, foreclosed enforcement of Pennsylvania's registration law.\n First. That the supremacy of the national power in the general field of foreign affairs, including power over immigration, naturalization and deportation, is made clear by the Constitution was pointed out by authors of The Federalist in 1787,9 and has since been given continuous recognition by this Court. \n10\n When the national government by treaty or statute has established rules and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 63]\n\u00a0\n regulations touching the rights, privileges, obligations or burdens of aliens as such, the treaty or statute is the supreme law of the land. No state can add to or take from the force and effect of such treaty or statute, for Article VI of the Constitution provides that 'This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.' The Federal Government, representing as it does the collective interests of the forty-eight states, is entrusted with full and exclusive responsibility for the conduct of affairs with foreign sovereignties. 'For local interests the several states of the Union exist, but for national purposes, embracing our relations with foreign nations, we are but one people, one nation, one power.' \n11\n Our system of government is such that the interest of the cities, counties and states, no less than the interest of the people of the whole nation, imperatively requires that federal power in the field affecting foreign relations be left entirely free from local interference. As Mr. Justice Miller well observed of a California \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 64]\n\u00a0\n statute burdening immigration: 'If (the United States) should get into a difficulty which would lead to war, or to suspension of intercourse, would California alone suffer, or all the Union?'12\n One of the most important and delicate of all international relationships, recognized immemorially as a responsibility of government, has to do with the protection of the just rights of a country's own nationals when those nationals are in another country. Experience has shown that international controversies of the gravest moment, sometimes even leading to war, may arise from real or imagined wrongs to another's subjects inflicted, or permitted, by a government. \n13\n This country, like other nations, has entered into numerous treaties of amity and commerce since its inception-treaties entered into under express constitutional authority, and binding \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 65]\n\u00a0\n upon the states as well as the nation. Among those treaties have been many which not only promised and guaranteed broad rights and privileges to aliens sojourning in our own territory, but secured reciprocal promises and guarantees for our own citizens while in other lands. And apart from treaty obligations, there has grown up in the field of international relations a body of customs defining with more or less certainty the duties owing by all nations to alien residents-duties which our State Department has often successfully insisted foreign nations must recognize as to our nationals abroad. \n14\n In general, both treaties and international practices have been aimed at preventing injurious discriminations against aliens. Concerning such treaties, this Court has said: 'While treaties, in safeguarding important rights in the interest of reciprocal beneficial relations, may by their express terms afford a measure of protection to aliens which citizens of one or both of the parties may not be able to demand against their own government, the general purpose of treaties of amity and commerce is to avoid injurious discrimination in either country against the citizens of the other.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Legal imposition of distinct, unusual and extraordinary burdens and obligations upon aliens-such as subjecting \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 66]\n\u00a0\n them alone, though perfectly law-abiding, to indiscriminate and repeated interception and interrogation by public officials-thus bears an inseparable relationship to the welfare and tranquillity of all the states, and not merely to the welfare and tranquillity of one. Laws imposing such burdens are not mere census requirements, and even though they may be immediately associated with the accomplishment of a local purpose, they provoke questions in the field of international affairs. And specialized regulation of the conduct of an alien before naturalization is a matter which Congress must consider in discharging its constitutional duty 'To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization ....' It cannot be doubted that both the state and the federal registration laws belong 'to that class of laws which concern the exterior relation of this whole nation with other nations and governments.' \n16\n Consequently the regulation of aliens is so intimately blended and intertwined with responsibilities of the national government that where it acts, and the state also acts on the same subject, 'the act of congress, or the treaty, is supreme; and the law of the state, though enacted in the exercise of powers not controverted, must yield to it.' \n17\n And where the federal government, in the exercise of its superior authority in this field, has enacted a complete scheme of regulation and has therein provided a standard for the registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail or complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or aux- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 67]\n\u00a0\n iliary regulations. \n18\n There is not-and from the very nature of the problem there cannot be-any rigid formula or rule which can be used as a universal pattern to determine the meaning and purpose of every act of Congress. This Court, in considering the validity of state laws in the light of treaties or federal laws touching the same subject, has made use of the following expressions: conflicting; contrary to; occupying the field; repugnance; difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; and interference. \n19\n But none of these expressions provides an infallible constitutional test or an exclusive constitutional yardstick. In the final analysis, there can be no one crystal clear distinctly marked formula. Our primary function is to determine whether, under the circumstances of this particular case, Pennsylvania's law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. \n20\n And in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 68]\n\u00a0\n that determination, it is of importance that this legislation is in a field which affects international relations, the one aspect of our government that from the first has been most generally conceded imperatively to demand broad national authority. Any concurrent state power that may exist is restricted to the narrowest of limits; the state's power here is not bottomed on the same broad base as is its power to tax. 21 And it is also of importance that this legislation deals with the rights, liberties, and personal freedoms of human beings, and is in an entirely different category from state tax statutes or state pure food laws regulating the labels on cans. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n Our conclusion is that appellee is correct in his contention that the power to restrict, limit, regulate, and register aliens as a distinct group is not an equal and continuously existing concurrent power of state and nation, but that whatever power a state may have is subordinate to supreme national law. \n23\n We proceed there- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 69]\n\u00a0\n fore to an examination of Congressional enactments to ascertain whether or not Congress has acted in such manner that its action should preclude enforcement of Pennsylvania's law.\n Second For many years Congress has provided a broad and comprehensive plan describing the terms and conditions upon which aliens may enter this country, how they may acquire citizenship, and the manner in which they may be deported. Numerous treaties, in return for reciprocal promises from other governments, have pledged the solemn obligation of this nation to the end that aliens residing in our territory shall not be singled out for the imposition of discriminatory burdens. Our Constitution and our Civil Rights Act have guaranteed to aliens 'the equal protection of the laws ( which) is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.' \n24\n With a view to limiting prospective residents from foreign lands to those possessing the qualities deemed essential to good and useful citizenship in America, carefully defined qualifications are required to be met before aliens may enter our country. These qualifications include rigid requirements as to health, education, integrity, character, and adaptability to our institutions. Nor is the alien left free from the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 70]\n\u00a0\n application of federal laws after entry and before naturalization. If during the time he is residing here he should be found guilty of conduct contrary to the rules and regulations laid down by Congress, he can be deported. At the time he enters the country, at the time he applies for permission to acquire the full status of citizenship, and during the intervening years, he can be subjected to searching investigations as to conduct and suitability for citizenship. \n25\n And in 1940 Congress added to this comprehensive scheme a complete system for alien registration.\n The nature of the power exerted by Congress, the object sought to be attained, and the character of the obligations imposed by the law, are all important in considering the question of whether supreme federal enactments preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject. \n26\n Opposition to laws permitting invasion of the personal liberties of law- abiding individuals, or singling out aliens as particularly dangerous and undesirable groups, is deep-seated in this country. Hostility to such legislation in America stems back to our colonial history,27 and champions of freedom for the individual have always vigorously opposed burdensome registration systems. The drastic requirements of the alien Acts of 179828 brought about a political upheaval in this country the repercussions from which have not even yet wholly subsided. 29 So violent was the reaction to the 1798 laws that almost a century elapsed before a second registration \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 71]\n\u00a0\n act was passed. This second law, which required Chinese to register and carry identification cards with them at all times, was enacted May 5, 1892, 8 U.S.C.A.  263, 281 et seq. An opponent of this legislation, speaking in the Senate of the requirement that cards be carried, said: '(The Chinese covered by the Act) are here ticket-of-leave men. Precisely as, under the Australian law, a convict is allowed to go at large, upon a ticket-of-leave, these people are to be allowed to go at large, and earn their livelihood, but they must have their tickets-of-leave in their possession. ... This inaugurates in our system of government a new departure; one, I believe, never before practiced, although it was suggested in conference that some such rules had been adopted in slavery times to secure the peace of society.' \n30\n\u00a0\n\n For many years bills have been regularly presented to every Congress providing for registration of aliens. Some of these bills proposed annual registration of aliens, issuance of identification cards containing information about and a photograph of the bearer, exhibition of the cards on demand, payment of an annual fee, and kindred requirements. \n31\n Opposition to these bills was based upon charges that their requirements were at war with the fundamental principles of our free government, in that they would bring about unnecessary and irritating restrictions upon personal liberties of the individual, and would subject aliens to a system of indiscriminate questioning similar to the espionage systems existing in other lands. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 72]\n\u00a0\n When Congress passed the Alien Registration Act of 1940, many of the provisions which had been so severely criticized were not included. \n33\n The Congressional purpose, as announced by the chairman of the Senate sub- committee which drafted the final bill, was to 'work ... the new provisions into the existing (immigration and naturalization) laws, so as to make a harmonious whole.' \n34\n That 'harmonious whole' included the 'Uniform Rule of Naturalization' the Constitution empow- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 73]\n\u00a0\n ered the Congress to provide. \n35\n And as a part of that 'harmonious whole', under the federal Act aliens need not carry cards, and can only be punished for wilful failure to register. \n36\n Further, registration records and finger-prints must be kept secret and cannot be revealed except to agencies-such as a state-upon consent of the Commissioner and the Attorney General.\n We have already adverted to the conditions which make the treatment of aliens, in whatever state they may be located, a matter of national moment. And whether or not registration of aliens is of such a nature that the Constitution permits only of one uniform national system, it cannot be denied that the Congress might validly conclude that such uniformity is desirable. The legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress was trying to steer a middle path, realizing that any registration requirement was a departure from our traditional policy of not treating aliens as a thing apart, but also feeling that the Nation was in need of the type of information to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 74]\n\u00a0\n be secured. 37 Having the constitutional authority so to do, it has provided a standard for alien registration in a single integrated and all- embracing system in order to obtain the information deemed to be desirable in connection with aliens. When it made this addition to its uniform naturalization and immigration laws, it plainly manifested a purpose to do so in such a way as to protect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system, and to leave them free from the possibility of inquisitorial practices and police surveillance that might not only affect our international relations but might also generate the very disloyalty which the law has intended guarding against. Under these circumstances, the Pennsylvania Act cannot be enforced. Accordingly, the judgment below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n In think the judgment below should be reversed.\n Undoubtedly Congress, in the exercise of its power to legislate in aid of powers granted by the Constitution to the national government may greatly enlarge the exercise of federal authority and to an extent which need not now be defined, it may, if such is its will, thus subtract from the powers which might otherwise be exercised by \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 75]\n\u00a0\n the states. Assuming, as the Court holds, that Congress could constitutionally set up an exclusive registration system for aliens, I think it has not done so and that it is not the province of the courts to do that which Congress has failed to do.\n At a time when the exercise of the federal power is being rapidly expanded through Congressional action, it is difficult to overstate the importance of safeguarding against such diminution of state power by vague inferences as to what Congress might have intended if it had considered the matter or by reference to our own conceptions of a policy which Congress has not expressed and which is not plainly to be inferred from the legislation which it has enacted. Cf. Graves v. O'keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466, 479\n, 480 S., 487, 59 S.Ct. 595, 597, 598, 601, 120 A.L.R. 1466. The Judiciary of the United States should not assume to strike down a state law which is immediately concerned with the social order and safety of its people unless the statute plainly and palpably violates some right granted or secured to the national government by the Constitution or similarly encroaches upon the exercise of some authority delegated to the United States for the attainment of objects of national concern.\n The opinion of the Court does not deny, and I see no reason to doubt that the Pennsylvania registration statute, when passed, was a lawful exercise of the constitutional power of the state. With exceptions not now material it requires aliens resident in the state, who have not declared their intention to become citizens, to register annually, to pay a registration fee of $1.00, and to carry a registration identification card. It affords to the state a convenient method of ascertaining the number and whereabouts of aliens within the state, which it is entitled to know, and a means of their identification. It is an available aid in the enforcement of a number of statutes of the state applicable to aliens whose constitu- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 76]\n\u00a0\n tional validity has not been questioned, one of which has been held by this Court not to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138\n, 34 S.Ct. 281.1\n The national government has exclusive control over the admission of aliens into the United States, but after entry, an alien resident within a state, like a citizen, is subject to the police powers of the state and, in the exercise of that power, state legislatures may pass laws applicable exclusively to aliens so long as the distinction taken between aliens and citizens is not shown to be without rational basis. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, supra; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n, 44 S.Ct. 15; Cockrill v. California, \n268 \nU.S. 258\n, 45 S.Ct. 490; Ohio v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 396\n, 47 S.Ct. 630, 631, and cases cited. The federal government has no general police power over aliens and, so far as it can exercise any control over them, it must be in the pursuance of a power granted to it by the Constitution.\n The opinion of the Court does not support its conclusion upon the ground that in the absence of federal legislation on the subject there is any want of power in the state to pass the present statute. It does not suggest nor could it well do so that in the absence of Congressional action the Pennsylvania statute either by its own terms or in its operation interferes with or obstructs the author- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 77]\n\u00a0\n ity conferred by the Constitution on the national government over the national defense, the conduct of foreign relations, its powers over immigration and deportation of aliens or their naturalization. The existence of the national power to conduct foreign relations and negotiate treaties does not foreclose state legislation dealing exclusively with aliens as such. This Court has consistently held that treaties of the United States for the protection of resident aliens do not supersede such legislation unless they conflict with it. See Ohio v. Deckebach, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 395\n, 47 S.Ct. 631, and cases cited; Todok v. Union State Bank, \n281 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 50 S.Ct. 363, 365 et seq.; cf. Nielson v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47\n, 49 S.Ct. 223. It is not contended that the Pennsylvania statute conflicts with any term of any treaty.\n The question presented here is a different one from that considered in Henderson et al. v. Mayor of New York et al., \n92 \nU.S. 259\n, 273, where the state taxation and registration of all persons entering the United States through a port of the state was held to be a regulation of foreign commerce forbidden to the states by the Constitution, even though Congress had passed no similar legislation. The registration of aliens resident in a state is not a regulation of interstate or foreign commerce or of the entry or deportation of aliens and would seem to be no more an exercise of any power granted to the national government or an encroachment upon it than is a state census for local purposes an infringement of the national authority to take a national census for national purposes. It is the federal act alone which is pointed to as curtailing or withdrawing the reserved power of the state over its alien population.\n Title I of the federal statute, 18 U.S.C.A.  9-13, penalizes certain acts of any persons intended to interfere with, impair or influence the loyalty, morale or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States. Title II, 8 U.S.C.A.  137, 155, 156a, among other things, provides for the deportation of aliens after con- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 78]\n\u00a0\n viction and service of sentence for violations of the provisions of Title I. And the evident purpose of the registration provisions of Title III, 8 U.S.C.A.  451 et seq., is to aid in the enforcement of the other provisions of the Act and in the prevention of subversive activities of aliens resident within the United States. It requires the registration and fingerprinting of all aliens over fourteen years of age, with exceptions not now material, who are not registered and fingerprinted upon entering the country. Registered aliens resident in the United States are required to notify the Commissioner of Immigration of any change of residence and penalties are imposed for wilful non-compliance. As construed and applied by the opinion of the Court the federal act denies to the states the practicable means of identifying their alien residents and of recording their whereabouts and it withholds from the states the benefit of the information secured under the federal act except insofar as it may be made available to them on application to the Attorney General.\n It is conceded that the federal act in operation does not at any point conflict with the state statute, and it does not by its terms purport to control or restrict state authority in any particular. But the government says that Congress by passing the federal act, has 'occupied the field' so as to preclude the enforcement of the state statute and that the administration of the latter might well conflict with Congressional policy to protect the civil liberty of aliens against the harassments of intrusive police surveillance.\n Little aid can be derived from the vague and illusory but often repeated formula that Congress 'by occupying the field' has excluded from it all state legislation. Every Act of Congress occupies some field, but we must know the boundaries of that field before we can say that it has precluded a state from the exercise of any power reserved to it by the Constitution. To discover \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 79]\n\u00a0\n the boundaries we look to the federal statute itself, read in the light of its constitutional setting and its legislative history.\n Federal statutes passed in aid of a granted power obviously supersede state statutes with which they conflict. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Illinois Brick Co., \n297 \nU.S. 447, 459\n, 56 S.Ct. 556, 559. See Kelly v. Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 58 S.Ct. 87, 92. But we are pointed to no such conflict here. In the exercise of such powers Congress also has wide scope for prohibiting state regulation of matters which Congress may, but has not undertaken to regulate itself. But no words of the statute or of any committee report, or any Congressional debate indicate that Congress intended to withdraw from the state any part of their constitutional power over aliens within their borders. We must take it that Congress was not unaware that some nineteen states have statutes or ordinances requiring some form of registration for aliens, seven of them dating from the last war. The repeal of this legislation is not to be inferred from the silence of Congress in enacting a law which at no point conflicts with the state legislation and is harmonious with it.\n The exercise of the federal legislative power is certainly not more potent to curtail the exercise of state power over aliens than is the exercise of the treaty making power. Yet as we have seen no treaty has that effect unless it conflicts with a state statute. The passage of the National Pure Food and Drug Act, 21 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., did not preclude the states from supplementing it by like additional requirements not conflicting with those of the Congressional act. Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 503\n, 32 S.Ct. 715. The enactment of federal laws for the inspection, as a safety measure, of vessels plying navigable waters of the United States does not foreclose the states from like inspection of the hull and machinery of such vessels within the state, to insure safety and determine seaworthiness, demands \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 80]\n\u00a0\n which lie outside the federal requirements. Kelly v. Washington, supra. The passage of the National Draft and the National Espionage Acts, 50 U.S. C.A. Appendix,  201 et seq., and  31 et seq., with their penalties for violation, did not preclude a state from making it a misdemeanor for any person to advocate that citizens of the state refuse to aid or assist the United States in carrying on a war. Gilbert v. Minnesota, \n254 \nU.S. 325\n, 41 S.Ct. 125; cf. Halter v. Nebraska, \n205 \nU.S. 34\n, 27 S.Ct. 419, 10 Ann.Cas. 525; see also Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S.Ct. 92; Carey v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 118\n, 39 S.Ct. 403; Dickson v. Uhlmann Grain Co., \n288 \nU.S. 188\n, 53 S.Ct. 362, 83 A.L.R. 492; Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346\n, 53 S.Ct. 611; Maurer v. Hamilton, \n309 \nU.S. 598, 614\n, 60 S.Ct. 726, 734. These are but a few of the many examples of the long established principle of constitutional interpretation that an exercise by the state of its police power, which would be valid if not superseded by federal action, is superseded only where the repugnance or conflict is so 'direct and positive' that the two acts cannot 'be fairly reconciled or consistently stand together'. Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243; Kelly v. Washington, supra, \n302 \nU.S. 10\n, 58 S.Ct. 92. A federal registration act designed to aid in enforcing federal statutes and to prevent subversive activities against the national government can stand consistently with a like statute applicable to residents passed in aid of state laws and as a safeguard to property and persons within the state, as readily as the federal and state laws which annually demand two separate income tax returns of the citizen.\n The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the civil liberties of aliens as well as of citizens against infringement by state action in the enactment of laws and their administration as well. Again we are pointed to nothing in the Federal Alien Registration Act or in the records of its passage through Congress to indicate that Congress thought those guarantees inadequate or that in requiring registration of all aliens it undertook to prevent the states from passing any registration measure otherwise constitutional. True, it was careful to bring the new \n\n[312 \nU.S. 52, 81]\n\u00a0\n legislation into harmony with existing federal statutes and to avoid, so far as consistent with its purposes, any harsh or oppressive requirements, but in all this there is to be found no warrant for saying that there was a Congressional purpose to curtail the exercise of any constitutional power of the state over its alien residents or to protect the alien from state action which the Constitution prohibits and which the federal courts stand ready to prevent. See Hague v. C.I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 518\n, 525 S., 59 S. Ct. 954, 965, 968 et seq.\n Here compliance with the state law does not preclude or even interfere with compliance with the act of Congress. The enforcement of both acts involves no more inconsistency, no more inconvenience to the individual, and no more embarrassment to either government than do any of the laws, state and national, such as revenue laws, licensing laws, or police regulations, where interstate commerce is involved, which are equally applied to the citizen because he is subject, as are aliens, to a dual sovereignty.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pa.Stats.Ann., tit. 35,  1801-1806. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The exceptions are: aliens who are the 'father or mother of a son or daughter who has served in the service of the United States during any war'; aliens who have resided in the United States continuously since December 31, 1908, without acquiring a criminal record; and aliens who have filed their application for citizenship. The latter exception is qualified by the proviso that aliens in that category must still register if they 'shall not have become naturalized within a period of three years' after applying for citizenship. Since federal law requires five years residence before citizenship can be acquired (8 U.S.C.  382, 8 U.S.C.A.  382), this exception means that aliens may be exempt under the Pennsylvania statute for the first three years after their arrival but subject to the statute for the two years immediately preceding their eligibility for citizenship. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 30 F.Supp. 470. One alien and one naturalized citizen joined in proceedings filed against certain state officials to enjoin enforcement of the Act. The answer of the defendants admitted the material allegations of the petition and defended the Act on the ground that it was within the power of the state. Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. The requested relief was denied as to the naturalized citizen but granted as to the alien. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The case is here on appeal under section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. We noted probable jurisdiction on March 25, 1940, 60 S.Ct. 718. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Public Act No. 670, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., c. 439, 8 U.S.C.A.  451 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Cf. Vandenbark v.

Several states still have dormant on their statute books laws passed in 1917-18, empowering the governor to require registration when a state of war exists or when public necessity requires such a step. E.g., Conn. Gen.Stats. (1930) tit. 59,  6042; Fla.Comp.Gen. Laws (1927)  2078; Iowa Code (1939)  503; La.Gen.Stats. (Dart, 1939) tit. 3,  282, Acts La. No. 20 of 1917, Ex. Sess.; Me.Rev.Stats. (1930) ch. 34 ,  3; N.H.Pub.Laws (1926) ch. 154; N.Y.Consol.Laws, c. 18, Executive Law ,  10. Other states, like Pennsylvania, have passed registration laws more recently. E.g., S.C.Acts (1940) No. 1014,  9, p. 1939; N.C.Code ( 1939)  193(a) to 193(h). In several states, municipalities have recently undertaken local alien registration.\n Registration statutes of Michigan and California were held unconstitutional in Arrowsmith v. Voorhies, D.C., 55 F.2d 310, and Ex parte Ah Cue, 101 Cal. 197, 35 P. 556. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The importance of national power in all matters relating to foreign affairs and the inherent danger of state action in this field are clearly developed in Federalist papers No. 3, 4, 5, 42 and 80. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] E.g., Henderson v. Mayor of New York, \n92 \nU.S. 259\n; People v. Compagnie Generale Transtlantique, \n107 \nU.S. 59\n, 2 S.Ct. 87; Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 711\n, 13 S.Ct. 1046, 1021. Cf.

United States), \n130 \nU.S. 581, 606\n, 9 S.Ct. 623, 630. Thomas Jefferson, who was not generally favorable to broad federal powers, expressed a similar view in 1787: 'My own general idea was, that the States should severally preserve their sovereignty in whatever concerns themselves alone, and that whatever may concern another State, or any foreign nation, should be made a part of the federal sovereignty.' Memoir, Correspondence and Miscellanies from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson (1829), vol. 2, p. 230, letter to Mr. Wythe. Cf. James Madison in Federalist paper No. 42: 'The second class of powers, lodged in the general government, consist of those which regulate in intercourse with foreign nations. ... This class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal administration. If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations.' \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Chy Lung v. Freeman, \n92 \nU.S. 275\n, 279. Cf. Alexander Hamilton in Federalist paper No. 80: 'The peace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposal of a part. The Union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members.' That the Congress was not unaware of the possible international repercussions of registration legislation is apparent from a study of the history of the 1940 federal Act. Congressman Coffee, speaking against an earlier version of the bill, said: 'Are we not guilty of deliberately insulting nations with whom we maintain friendly diplomatic relations? Are we not humiliating their nationals? Are we not violating the traditions and experiences of a century and a half?' 84 Cong.Rec. 9536. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] For a collection of typical international controversies that have arisen in this manner, see Dunn, The Protection of Nationals (1932), pp. 13 et seq. Cf. John Jay in Federalist paper No. 3: 'The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the causes, whether real or pretended, which provoke or invite them. If this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many just causes of war are likely to be given by United America as by disunited America; for if it should turn out that United America will probably give the fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.' \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] 'In consequence of the right of protection over its subjects abroad which every State enjoys, and the corresponding duty of every State to treat aliens on its territory with a certain consideration, an alien ... must be afforded protection for his person and property. ... Every State is by the Law of Nations compelled to grant to aliens at least equality before the law with its citizens, as far as safety of person and property is concerned. An alien must in particular not be wronged in person or property by the officials and courts of a State. Thus the police must not arrest him without just cause. ...' 1 Oppenheim, International Law (5th ed., 1937), pp. 547-548.

In each of those cases this Court sustained state legislation which applied to aliens only, against an attack on the ground that the laws violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. In each case, however, the Court was careful to point out that the state law was not in violation of any valid treaties adopted by the United States, and in no instance did it appear that Congress had passed legislation on the subject. In the only case of this type in which there was an outstanding treaty provision in conflict with the state law, this Court held the state law invalid. Asakura v.

Congressman Celler, speaking in 1928 of the repeated defeat of registration bills and of an attempt by the Secretary of Labor to require registration of incoming aliens by executive order, said: 'But here is the real vice of the situation and the core of the difficulty: 'The admitted alien,' as the order states, 'should be cautioned to present (his card) for inspection if and when subsequently requested so to do by an officer of the Immigration Service.\" 70 Cong.Rec. 190. \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] Congressman Smith, who introduced the original of the bill that as finally adopted became the 1940 Act, said in Committee: 'The drafting of the bill is ... a codification of measures that have been offered from time to time. ... I have tried to eliminate from the bills that have been offered on the subject those which seemed to me would cause much controversy.' Hearings before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Judiciary Committee, H.R. 5138, April 12, 1939, p. 71. \n[\nFootnote 34\n] Cong. Rec., June 15, 1940, p. 12620. Senator Connally made this statement in explaining why it had been found necessary to substitute a new bill for the bill originally sent to the Senate by the House. In detailing the care that had been taken in the drafting of the new measure, he said: 'We regretted very much that we had to discard entirely the bill passed by the House and substitute a new bill after the enacting clause. However, we called in Mr. Murphy, of the Drafting Service, who worked with us some 2 weeks every day. ... We called on the Department of Justice, and had the Solicitor General with us. We called in the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, and together we went over all the existing laws, and worked the new provisions into the existing laws, so as to make a harmonious whole.' This Senate version was substantially the Act as finally adopted; the alien registration provisions are title III of a broader Act dealing with deportable offenses and advocacy of disloyalty in the armed forces. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] In Federalist paper No. 42, the reasons for giving this power to the federal government are thus explained: 'By the laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had rendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of residence. What would have been the consequence, if such persons, by residence or otherwise, had acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another State ...? Whatever the legal consequences might have been, other consequences would probably have resulted of too serious a nature not to be provided against. The new Constitution has accordingly, with great propriety, made provision against them, and all others proceeding from the defect of the Confederation on this head, by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States.' \n[\nFootnote 36\n] That the Congressional decision to punish only wilful transgressions was deliberate rather than inadvertent is conclusively demonstrated by the debates on the bill. E.g., Cong. Rec., June 15, 1940, p. 12621. And see note 37, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] Congressman Celler, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee which reported out the bill, said in stating his intention of voting for the 1940 Act: 'Mr. Speaker, judging the temper of the Nation, I believe this compromise report is the best to be had under the circumstances and I shall vote for it .... Furthermore, I think the conferees have done a good job because the punishment is not too great .... There must be proof ... that the alien wilfully refuses to register .... I drew the minority report against this bill originally, because it provided some very harsh provisions against aliens. Some of the harshness and some of the severity of the original bill have been eliminated .... I must admit that it is the best to be had under the circumstances.' Cong. rec., June 22, 1940, pp. 13468-9. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tit. 34,  1311.1001, Purdon's Penn. Stat.Ann., prohibiting hunting by aliens, was sustained in the Patsone case, \n232 \nU.S. 138\n, 34 S. Ct. 281. Cf. Tit. 30  240. Other Pennsylvania statutes whose validity have not been passed upon regulate the activities of aliens: Tit. 63, setting forth license requirements for the practice of certain professions and occupations, make special requirements for aliens seeking to practice as certified public accountants ( 1), architects ( 22), engineers ( 137), nurses ( 202), physicians and surgeons ( 406), and undertakers ( 478c). The real property holdings of aliens are limited to 5000 acres of land or land producing net income of $20,000 or less (Title 68,  28, 32). Taxes are to be deducted from the wages of aliens by their employers when the tax collector requests (Tit. 72,  5681). \n\n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOLIDAY v. JOHNSTON(1941)\nNo. 14\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n As Amended June 2, 1941. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles A. Horsky, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Herbert Wechsler, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner applied to the District Court for the Northern District of California for a writ of habeas corpus. His petition alleged that he was unlawfully detained by the respondent in Alcatraz Penitentiary; that he had been indicted in the District Court for North Dakota under an Act of May 18, 1934, Sec. 2,1 the indictment being in two counts, one for robbery of an insured bank and the other for jeopardizing the lives of officials of the bank in the course of the robbery; that he pleaded guilty to both counts and was sentenced to ten years under the first and to fifteen years under the second, 'commencing at the expiration of the sentence imposed under count one.' The petition charged that he was unlawfully detained because he was tried without the advice and assistance of counsel, was ignorant of his right to have counsel although unable to pay for an attorney, was not advised by the court that he was entitled to counsel, and was unable to, and did not, intelligently waive his constitutional right to have counsel. The petition alleged that the two counts of the indictment charged but one offense and that the petitioner was placed in double jeopardy by the imposition of the consecutive sentences.\n The court issued a rule on the respondent to show cause why a writ should not issue. The respondent made return showing that the petitioner was held under a commitment issued pursuant to his conviction upon the indictment in question. He attached a certificate of the judge who imposed the sentence attesting to his uniform practice of inquiring of prisoners charged with felony whether they wanted counsel and his firm belief that he so inquired of the petitioner, and the affidavit of a deputy marshal to the effect that petitioner said he did not desire counsel.\n Petitioner filed a traverse in which he denied that the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n trial judge had interrogated him as stated and denied that he had made the alleged statement to the deputy marshal. The district judge issued a writ commanding the respondent to produce the petitioner before a commissioner of the District Court at the Alcatraz prison on a day named. This was done and the commissioner there took the petitioner's testimony and later received the depositions of two witnesses on behalf of the respondent. The commissioner submitted a report in which he recited his proceedings, summarized the asserted grounds for relief, made findings of fact, stated conclusions of law, and recommended that the application be denied. After hearing argument on the report the judge entered an order discharging the writ.\n The petitioner applied for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. This was denied by an order which recited that, so far as the petition was based on the alleged invalidity of the sentence on the second count of the indictment it was premature and, so far as it was grounded on the deprivation of the assistance of counsel, the evidence sustained the finding of the commissioner that the petitioner had competently and intelligently waived his right to such assistance. Accordingly, the judge denied an appeal for want of merit in the application.\n The petitioner moved the Circuit Court of Appeals for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, which was denied. He then petitioned this Court for certiorari2, Ex parte Holiday, \n312 \nU.S. 673\n, 61 S.Ct. 727, 85 L.Ed. --, and for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Both petitions were granted and counsel was appointed to represent him in this Court.\n The burden of petitioner's complaint is that the procedure adopted by the District Court,-that of a hearing before a commissioner and the disposition of the cause on the record made before him-is a plain violation of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n the Acts of Congress regulating the practice in habeas corpus cases. In addition, he seeks a reversal of the judgment on the ground that the sentence on the second count is void. He insists that he is entitled to a decision to this effect so that he may apply for parole under the sentence imposed on the first count.\n The respondent argues that we need not consider the question of the regularity of the hearing in habeas corpus since the petition should have been denied as premature so far as it rested on the asserted illegality of the sentence and since the District Court should have dismissed the petition for insufficiency of the allegations concerning the denial of assistance of counsel.\n\n 1. \nThe respondent admits that  2 of the Act of May 18, 1934, supra, does not create two separate crimes but prescribes alternative sentences for the same crime depending upon the manner of its perpetration. This concession, however, does not aid the petitioner. The erroneous imposition of two sentences for a single offense of which the accused has been convicted, or as to which he has pleaded guilty, does not constitute double jeopardy. And if, as the petitioner contends, the first sentence of ten years is valid and the second void, he is no better off. Conceding, without deciding, that he is right in saying the first sentence is the only valid one, he has not served that sentence and is not entitled now to be discharged from custody under it. He urges that if the second sentence is adjudged void he will now be entitled to apply for parole under the first. But we have recently decided that habeas corpus cannot be awarded to afford a prisoner such an opportunity. \n3\n His remedy is to apply for vacation of the sentence and a resentence in conformity to the statute under which he was adjudged guilty. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 350]\n\u00a0\n 2. The respondent's contention that we should affirm the judgment because the petition for the writ insufficiently alleges a denial of constitutional right and fails to rebut the presumption of regularity which attaches to the record of petitioner's trial and conviction may be shortly answered. A petition for habeas corpus ought not to be scrutinized with technical nicety. Even if it is insufficient in substance it may be amended in the interest of justice. In the present instance, moreover, the judge, by calling on the respondent to show cause, adjudged that, in his view, the petition was sufficient and, by referring the cause to a master, evinced a judgment that the petition, the return, and the traverse made issues of fact justifying the taking of evidence. These decisions did not constitute an abuse of discretion and we will not review them.\n\n 3. \nThe respondent insists that the petition was premature if the petitioner's claim that he was denied the assistance of counsel is without merit, but the contention is pressed only if we find that no question as to such denial is presented.\n\n 4. \nWe come then to the serious question in the case. Was the method of trial of the fact issues presented by the pleadings in accordance with law?\n Revised Statutes  757, 758, and 7614 prescribe the procedure to be followed. The first requires that 'The person to whom the writ is directed shall certify to the court, or justice, or judge before whom it is returnable the true cause of the detention of such party'; and the second that: 'The person making the return shall at the same time brin the body of the party before the judge who granted the writ.' \n5\n The third provides that: 'The \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 351]\n\u00a0\n court, or justice, or judge shall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts of the case, by hearing the testimony and arguments, and thereupon to dispose of the party as law and justice require'.\n It is plain, as the respondent concedes, that a commissioner is not a judge and that the command of the court's writ that the petitioner appear before that officer was not a literal compliance with the statute. The respondent argues, however, that the writ in effect referred the cause to the commissioner as a master whose function was to take the testimony and submit it, together with his findings and conclusions, for such action as the court might take upon such submission. The argument runs that this practice is in substance equivalent to a hearing before the judge in his proper person, has long been followed in the district courts in California, has not incurred the criticism of this Court in cases brought here where it was followed, is a convenient procedure, tends to expedite the disposition of such cases, is in accordance with long standing equity practice and is countenanced by Rule 53(a)(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We cannot sanction a departure from the plain mandate of the statute on any of the grounds advanced. We have recently emphasized the broad and liberal policy adopted by Congress respecting the office and use of the writ of habeas corpus in the interest of the protection of individual freedom to the end that the very truth and substance of the cause of a person's detention may be disclosed and justice be done. \n7\n The Congress has seen fit to lodge in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 352]\n\u00a0\n the judge the duty of investigation. One of the essential elements of the determination of the crucial facts is the weighing and appraising of the testimony. Plainly it was intended that the prisoner might invoke the exercise of this appraisal by the judge himself. We cannot say that an appraisal of the truth of the prisoner's oral testimony by a master or commissioner is, in the light of the purpose and object of the proceeding, the equivalent of the judge's own exercise of the function of the trier of the facts.\n The circumstance that the practice has grown up of referring such causes to a commissioner, has long been indulged in in the federal courts of California, and has found a place in a rule of court, cannot overcome the plain command of the statute. It is true that the practice was followed in certain deportation cases which were reviewed by this Court but, so far as appears, no point was made as to the procedure followed in those cases and the matter was passed without notice.\n It may be that the practice is a convenient one but, if so, that consideration is for Congress. In view of the plain terms in which the Congressional policy is evidenced in the habeas corpus act, the courts may not substitute another more convenient mode of trial.\n It is said that the procedure tends to expedite the disposition of habeas corpus cases. The record in this case would seem to contradict the argument. 8 And when it is remembered th t R.S.  7569 required that the return \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 353]\n\u00a0\n in this case be made within three days of the issue of the writ, and that R.S.  758, supra, required the respondent to produce the body at the same time he made the return; that R.S.  75910 commands that the hearing shall be set not more than five days after the return; and that R.S.  761, supra, enjoins the judge to proceed in a summary way to hear the cause and dispose of the petitioner, it is difficult to see how the comparatively cumbersome and time consuming procedure of reference, report, and hearing upon the report, can be thought a more expeditious method than that prescribed by the statute.\n The practice of referring equity causes to masters presents no persuasive analogy. The scope and purpose of the two proceedings are obviously different. Moreover, when Congress prescribed the procedure in habeas corpus the practice of reference to masters in chancery was well known to it. The legislature, nevertheless, saw fit to require a different procedure in habeas corpus cases.\n Finally, the sanction by Rule 53 of the Rules of Civil Procedure of references to masters does not aid in the decision of the question presented. Rule 81(a) (2) provides that appeals in habeas corpus cases are to be governed by the rules, but that the rules are not applicable 'otherwise than on appeal' in habeas corpus cases 'except to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States and has heretofore conformed to the practice in actions at law or suits in equity ....' Since the practice in habeas corpus is set forth in plain terms in the Revised Statutes to which reference has been made Rule 53 has no application.\n In summary, we hold that the provisions of the habeas corpus act, as embodied in the Revised Statutes, are too plain to be disregarded for any of the reasons advanced. The District Judge should himself have heard the pris- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 342, 354]\n\u00a0\n oner's testimony and, in the light of it and the other testimony, himself have found the facts and based his disposition of the cause upon his findings. The petitioner has not been afforded the right of testifying before the judge, which the statute plainly accords him. In order that he may have that right we reverse the judgment and remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion. We express no opinion as to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence heretofore adduced. The issues of fact will be for solution by the District Court upon a further hearing.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 783, 12 U.S.C.  588b, 12 U.S.C.A.  588b. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We have jurisdiction under  262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  377, 28 U.S.C.A.  377; In re 620 Church Street Corporation, \n299 \nU.S. 24\n, 57 S.Ct. 88. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] McNally v.

Alderson, of Austin, Minn., for petitioner. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 553]\n\u00a0\n Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen'l, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency against petitioner for failure to include in his 1934 and 1935 tax returns the income of three separate trusts declared by him in 1934. Each of the declarations of trust recited that the beneficiaries were 'Jay C. Hormel ( petitioner himself), and Germaine D. Hormel, his wife, as guardian for their son,' a different son being designated by each trust instrument. Each trust estate consisted of shares of stock in Geo. A. Hormel & Co., of which petitioner was an officer. Petitioner named himself and another as co-trustees; all dividends from each trust estate, up to $2,000 a year, were to be paid to petitioner's wife as guardian for the son named in the particular trust instrument, and any excess over $2,000 was to be paid to petitioner; the trusts were to expire automatically after three years, or upon the death of petitioner, or upon the death of the named son, whichever event should occur first; upon expiration of each trust, the entire principal should be the property of petitioner, his legatees, devisees, or heirs; petitioner and his wife (as guardian) had the power to remove petitioner's co-trustee at any time, and to choose a successor; the co-trustees could appoint proxies to exercise voting rights over the shares of stock making up the trust estates, and could sell the securities deposited and substitute others; it was provided that no title to the trust estates should vest in petitioner's wife, as guardian, or in his sons, and it was further provided that the wife and sons should have no power 'to sell, transfer, encumber or in any manner anticipate or dispose of any \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n interest in the trust estate'; and, finally, the trust instruments stated that the co-trustees were to be responsible for loss only upon wilful and deliberate violations of their duties.\n All of the trust income for the years in question was distributed to petitioner's wife as guardian, who reported it to the federal government as guardianship income. Petitioner, in his individual returns, did not include it. The Commissioner, taking the position that petitioner should have included the trust income in his individual returns, assessed a deficiency against him, asserting that the trusts were 'revocable' and the income therefore petitioner's within in the meaning of section 166 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  166.1 The Board of Tax Appeals decided against the Commissioner, holding that the income in question was taxable to petitioner neither under section 166 nor 167, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  166, 167,2 the two sections expressly relied on by the Commissioner before the Board. In the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Commissioner abandoned reliance on section 166, urged that the Board was in error as to taxability under section 167, and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n argued that in any event the income was taxable to petitioner under section 22(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 669.3 The taxpayer argued that the applicability of section 22(a) was not open for consideration, inasmuch as that section had not been relied on before the Board. The Circuit Court of Appeals, though agreeing with the Board as to non- taxability under sections 166 and 167, nevertheless ruled that section 22( a) could properly be considered, and held the income taxable to petitioner under that section. Because of a conflict among the Circuit Courts of Appeals on the propriety of considering section 22(a) under these circumstances,4 we granted certiorari. \n311 \nU.S. 626\n, 61 S.Ct. 35, 85 L.Ed . --. Two questions are presented for our decision: First, Was the court below correct in holding that section 22(a) should be considered? Second, If so, was the court below justified in determining that the income of these trusts was taxable to petitioner under section 22(a)?\n First. Petitioner in effect challenges the power of the Circuit Court of Appeals to pass upon any questions other than those which were directly and squarely presented in the proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals. That court's authority to review decisions of the Board rests on statutes, which provide in part that the Circuit Courts of Appeals 'have power to affirm or, if the decision of the Board is not in accordance with law, to modify or to reverse the decision of the Board, with or without \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n remanding the case for a rehearing, as justice may require.' 26 U.S.C.  1141(c)(1) (Supp.1939), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  1141(c)(1). In general, it is the function of the Board to determine the facts of a tax controversy on issues raised before it and to apply the law to those facts; and it is the function of the reviewing court to decide whether the Board has applied the correct rule of law. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Ordinarily an appellate court does not give consideration to issues not raised below. For our procedural scheme contemplates that parties shall come to issue in the trial forum vested with authority to determine questions of fact. This is essential in order that parties may have the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues which the trial tribunal is alone competent to decide; it is equally essential in order that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence. And the basic reasons which support this general principle applicable to trial courts make it equally desirable that parties should have an opportunity to offer evidence on the general issues involved in the less formal proceedings before administrative agencies entrusted with the responsibility of fact finding. Recognition of this general principle has caused this Court to say on a number of occasions that the reviewing court should pass by, without decision, questions which were not urged before the Board of Tax Appeals. But those cases do not announce an inflexible practice, as indeed they could not without \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n doing violence to the statutes which give to Circuit Courts of Appeals reviewing decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals the power to modify, reverse or remand decisions not in accordance with law 'as justice may require.' There may always be exceptional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below. See Blair v. Oesterlein Machine Co., \n275 \nU.S. 220, 225\n, 48 S.Ct. 87, 88.\n Rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice, not to defeat them. A rigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which courts of review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions which had not previously been specifically urged would be out of harmony with this policy. Orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice. And examination of the cases relied upon by petitioner discloses that this Court, in following in some cases the general principle sought to be invoked here by petitioner, has been careful to point out the circumstances justifying application of the practice in the particular case. Thus, for example, we held in Helvering v. Wood, \n309 \nU.S. 344, 348\n, 349 S., 60 S.Ct. 551, 553, that the government could not present in this Court as a wholly new issue the applicability of section 22(a). But we there especially relied upon the fact that the government, when the case was before the Circuit Court of Appeals, had made an express waiver of any reliance upon 22(a). In Helvering v. Tex-Penn Oil Co., \n300 \nU.S. 481, 498\n, 57 S.Ct. 569, 577, this Court declined to consider a newly presented question, but pointed out that it had not been raised by the Commissioner either in his notice of tax deficiency, in his appearances before the Board of Tax Appeals or the Circuit Court of Appeals, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 558]\n\u00a0\n or in his petition for certiorari to this Court. And in General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200\n, 206-207, 56 S.Ct. 185, 187, though this Court said that the Circuit Court of Appeals should not have considered a contention not presented to or ruled upon by the Board of Tax Appeals, the statement was buttressed by adding that the Circuit Court of Appeals had 'made an inference of fact directly in conflict with the stipulation of the parties and the findings, for which we think the record affords no support whatever. To remand the cause for further findings would be futile. The Board could not properly find anything which would assist the Commissioner's cause.' The plain implication of that decision was that the cause would have been remanded to the Board of Tax Appeals had the Court considered the newly raised point to be of sufficient merit. These decisions and others like them, while recognizing the desirability and existence of a general practice under which appellate courts confine themselves to the issues raised below, nevertheless do not lose sight of the fact that such appellate practice should not be applied where the obvious result would be a plain miscarriage of justice. Analogous in principle is the philosophy which underlies this Court's decisions with relation to appellate practices in other cases: those in which it has been held that a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals can be supported in the reviewing court on a new theory of law;6 those which have been remanded because the lower courts failed to give consideration to a phase of the case involving legal theories not presented;7 and those in which there have been judicial interpretations of existing law after decision below and pending appeal-interpretations which if \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 559]\n\u00a0\n applied might have materially altered the result. \n8\n Whether articulated or not, the philosophy underlying the exceptions to the general practice is in accord with the statutory authority given to courts reviewing decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals-decisions not in accordance with law should be modified, reversed or reversed and remanded 'as justice may require.'\n In accordance with this principle, we are of opinion that the court below should have given and properly did give consideration to section 22( a) in determining petitioner's tax liability. The Commissioner urged this point before the Circuit Court of Appeals and has strongly presented it here. At the time the Board of Tax Appeals made its decision in this case, we had not yet handed down our opinion in Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, in which we held that under section 22(a) the income of certain trusts was taxable to respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals was of opinion that there were no controlling distinctions between the trusts created by petitioner in this case and those created by Clifford. Here, as there, control over the trusts was completely in the hands of the taxpayer and his wife. For while petitioner's trust instruments showed a co-trustee acting with petitioner, the same instruments also disclosed that such co-trustee could be removed at any time by the joint action of petitioner and his wife. 'To hold otherwise (i. e., that petitioner is not subject to the tax) would be to treat the wife as a complete stranger; to let mere formalism obscure the normal consequences of family solidarity; and to force concepts of ownership to be fashioned out of legal niceties which may have little or no significance in such household arrangements.' \n9\n As the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n record now stands we think the court below correctly concluded that the trust income was taxable to petitioner under the principles announced in the Clifford case. Therefore to apply here the general principle of appellate practice for which petitioner contends would result in permitting him wholly to escape payment of a tax which under the record before us he clearly owes. Thus viewed, this is exactly the type of case where application of the general practice would defeat rather than promote the ends of justice, and the court below was right in so holding.\n But the Board of Tax Appeals neither found the facts nor considered the applicability of 22(a) in the light of the Clifford case. Congress has entrusted the Board with exclusive authority to determine disputed facts. Under these circumstances we do not feel that petitioner should be foreclosed from all opportunity to offer evidence before the Board on this issue, however remote may be his chance to take his case out of the Clifford rule. \n10\n Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court reversing the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed, with directions to the Board of Tax Appeals for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Where at any time the power to revest in the grantor title to any part of the corpus of the trust is vested-\n'(1) in the grantor, either alone or in conjunction with any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the corpus or the income therefrom, or\n\n'(2) in any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the corpus or the income therefrom, then the income of such part of the trust shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 167 reads in part as follows: '(a) Where any part of the income of a trust-\n'(1) is, or in the discretion of the grantor or of any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the income may be, held or accumulated for future distribution to the grantor; or\n\n'(2) may, in the discretion of the grantor or of any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the income, be distributed to the grantor; ....' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever. ...' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf., e.g., Helvering v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1941)\nNo. 517\nArgued: Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Walter J. Rosston and Edwin Hort, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We must determine whether the amount petitioner received as consideration for cancellation of a lease of realty in New York City was ordinary gross income as \n\n[313 \nU.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n defined in  22(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 178, 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 487, and whether in any event, petitioner sustained a loss through cancellation of the lease which is recognized in  23(e) of the same Act, 47 Stat. 169, 180, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 490.\n Petitioner acquired the property, a lot and ten-story office building, by devise from his father in 1928. At the time he became owner, the premises were leased to a firm which had sublet the main floor to the Irving Trust Co. In 1927, five years before the head lease expired, the Irving Trust Co. and petitioner's father executed a contract in which the latter agreed to lease the main floor and basement to the former for a term of fifteen years at an annual rental of $25,000, the term to commence at the expiration of the head lease.\n In 1933, the Irving Trust Co. found it unprofitable to maintain a branch in petitioner's building. After some negotiations, petitioner and the Trust Co. agreed to cancel the lease in consideration of a payment to petitioner of $140,000. Petitioner did not include this amount in gross income in his income tax return for 1933. On the contrary, he reported a loss of $21,494.75 on the theory that the amount he received as consideration for the cancellation was $21,494.75 less than the difference between the present value of the unmatured rental payments and the fair rental value of the main floor and basement for the unexpired term of the lease. He did not deduct this figure, however, because he reported other losses in excess of gross income.\n The Commissioner included the entire $140,000 in gross income, disallowed the asserted loss, made certain other adjustments not material here, and assessed a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed. 39 B.T. A. 922. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed per curiam on the authority of Warren Service Corp. v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 110 F.2d 723. 2 Cir., 112 F. 2d 167. Because of conflict with Commissioner v. Langwell Real Estate Corp ., 7 Cir., 47 F.2d 841, we \n\n[313 \nU.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n granted certiorari limited to the question whether, 'in computing net gain or loss for income tax purposes, a taxpayer (can) offset the value of the lease canceled against the consideration received by him for the cancellation'. \n311 \nU.S. 641\n, 61 S.Ct. 174, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner apparently contends that the amount received for cancellation of the lease was capital rather than ordinary income and that it was therefore subject to  101, 111-113, and 117, 47 Stat. 169, 191, 195-202, 207, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 504, 510-514, 524, which govern capital gains and losses. Further, he argues that even if that amount must be reported as ordinary gross income he sustained a loss which $ 23(e) authorizes him to deduct. We cannot agree.\n The amount received by petitioner for cancellation of the lease must be included in his gross income in its entirety. Section 22(a), copied in the margin,1 expressly defines gross income to include 'gains, profits, and income derived from ... rent, ... or gains or profits and income from any source whatever'. Plainly this definition reached the rent paid prior to cancellation just as it would have embraced subsequent payments if the lease had never been canceled. It would have included a prepayment of the discounted value of unmatured rental payments whether received at the inception of the lease or at any time thereafter. Similarly, it would have extended to the proceeds of a suit to recover damages had the Irving Trust Co. breached the lease in- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n stead of concluding a settlement. Compare United States v. Safety Car Heating Co., \n297 \nU.S. 88\n, 56 S.Ct. 353; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 150. That the amount petitioner received resulted from negotiations ending in cancellation of the lease rather than from a suit to enforce it cannot alter the fact that basically the payment was merely a substitute for the rent reserved in the lease. So far as the application of $ 22(a) is concerned, it is immaterial that petitioner chose to accept an amount less than the strict present value of the unmatured rental payments rather than to engage in litigation, possibly uncertain and expensive.\n The consideration received for cancellation of the lease was not a return of capital. We assume that the lease was 'property', whatever that signifies abstractly. Presumably the bond in Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, 131 A.L.R. 655, and the lease in Helvering v. Bruun, \n309 \nU.S. 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 631, were also 'property', but the interest coupon in Horst and the building in Bruun nevertheless were held to constitute items of gross income. Simply because the lease was 'property' the amount received for its cancellation was not a return of capital, quite apart from the fact that 'property' and 'capital' are not necessarily synonymous in the Revenue Act of 1932 or in common usage. Where, as in this case, the disputed amount was essentially a substitute for rental payments which  22(a) expressly characterizes as gross income, it must be regarded as ordinary income, and it is immaterial that for some purposes the contract creating the right to such payments may be treated as 'property' or 'capital'.\n For the same reasons, that amount was not a return of capital because petitioner acquired the lease as an incident of the realty devised to him by his father. Theoretically, it might have been possible in such a case to value realty and lease separately and to label each a capital asset. Compare Maass v. Higgins, \n312 \nU.S. 443\n, 61 S.Ct. 631, 85 L.Ed. --, decided March 3, 1941; \n\n[313 \nU.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n Appeal of Farmer, 1 B.T.A. 711. But that would not have converted into capital the amount petitioner received from the Trust Co. since  22(b)(3) 2 of the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 169, 178, would have required him to include in gross income the rent derived from the property, and that section, like  22(a), does not distinguish rental payments and a payment which is clearly a substitute for rental payments.\n We conclude that petitioner must report as gross income the entire amount received for cancellation of the lease without regard to the claimed disparity between that amount and the difference between the present value of the unmatured rental payments and the fair rental value of the property for the unexpired period of the lease. The cancellation of the lease involved nothing more than relinquishment of the right to future rental payments in return for a present substitute payment and possession of the leased premises. Undoubtedly it diminished the amount of gross income petitioner expected to realize, but to that extent he was relieved of the duty to pay income tax. Nothing in  23(e) 3 indicates that \n\n[313 \nU.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n Congress intended to allow petitioner to reduce ordinary income actually received and reported by the amount of income he failed to realize. See Warren Service Corp. v. Helvering, supra; Josey v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 104 F.2d 453; Tiscornia v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 95 F.2d 678; Farrelly- Walsh, Inc., v.

Commissioner, 7 Cir., 36 F.2d 212; Appeal of Denholm & McKay Co., 2 B.T.A. 444. We may assume that petitioner was injured insofar as the cancellation of the lease affected the value of the realty. But that would become a deductible loss only when its extent had been fixed by a closed transaction. Regulations No. 77, Art. 171, p. 46; United States v. White Dental Mfg.

Reidy, of Washington, D.C., for appellees United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Charles Hershenstein, of Jersey City, N.J., for appellee, City of Jersey City.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n On July 31, 1937, appellant filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a passenger tariff establishing a fare of 10 cents for interstate transportation on its downtown line in lieu of the existing fare of 6 cents. The Commission suspended the tariff and after full hearing found that the revenue results to appellant would be more favorable under an 8-cent fare than under a 10-cent fare and further determined that the proposed 10-cent fare would be unreasonable under Sections 1 and 15a of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 98, 99]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1-15a and that an 8-cent fare had been justified.\n The Commission directed the cancellation of the schedule filed, without prejudice to the establishment of an 8-cent fare, and accordingly, in July, 1938, appellant canceled its proposed tariff and put into effect a fare of 8 cents. The Commission refused a rehearing.\n In June, 1939, appellant brought this suit to set aside the Com ission's order. The case was heard in the District Court by three judges upon the record made before the Commission, and the court rendered its decision in June, 1940, 33 F.Supp. 495, holding that the findings of the Commission were based upon substantial evidence and that the order was within the Commission's authority, was not confiscatory, and did not deprive appellant of its property without due process of law.\n As this Court has observed, 'The raising of rates does not necessarily increase revenue. It may in particular localities reduce revenue instead of increasing it, by discouraging patronage'. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 214\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, 124, 125. The effect of an increased rate of 10 cents as compared with one of 8 cents, with respect to resulting revenues, was necessarily one of judgment upon evidence and the Commission had evidence before it with respect to traffic conditions in the area in question and the extent of probable diversion of traffic if the fare were increased to 10 cents. We conclude that in this relation there was evidence to support the Commission's findings and its findings supported its order.\n The decree of the District Court is affirmed.

Bisco and Daniel G. Judge, both of New York City, for petitioners. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 184]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. Worth Clark and William H. Langroise, both of Boise, Idaho, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the effect a federal district court should give to state court proceedings attaching, while appeal is pending, a judgment previously rendered by the federal court.\n Respondent, Lincoln Mine Operating Company, obtained judgment against petitioner, Huron Holding Corporation, in the federal district court for Idaho. Pending appeal of this judgment to the Circuit Court of Appeals, a New York creditor of Lincoln brought suit on a promissory note against Lincoln in a state court of New York. Upon a showing that Lincoln was an Idaho corporation, the New York court caused a warrant of attachment to issue against Lincoln's New York property. \n1\n In accordance with New York law,2 summons upon Lincoln was served by a Deputy Sheriff of Ada County, Idaho. Huron, a New York corporation, answered the warrant of attachment served upon it in New York, and admitted that it was the defendant against which judgment in favor of Lincoln had been en- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n tered in the Idaho District Court, and that the judgment was still unpaid, subject to its right on an appeal then pending. After the Circuit Court of Appeals had affirmed the Idaho District Court judgment, but before the mandate had been sent down, the New York court rendered judgment against Lincoln, execution was issued, and under the warrant of attachment the New York Sheriff was commanded to obtain satisfaction out of the judgment obligation of Huron to Lincoln. Under compulsion of the New York execution Huron paid and then filed a motion in the Idaho court asking that the federal court's judgment be marked satisfied. Lincoln countered with a motion against National Surety Company, the guarantor on Huron's supersedeas bond in the original action, asking that judgment against the surety be entered in favor of Lincoln. after a hearing on both motions, the District Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law, held that the judgment had been fully satisfied, and declined to enter judgment against the surety. \n3\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n4\n Because the issues involved are important to the orderly administration of justice in the relationship of state and federal courts, we granted certiorari. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner contends that the attachment was valid under the New York law, and should have been given full effect by the federal court. It is respondent's contention that (1) the attachment proceedings were void; and ( 2) even if not void, the District Court should not have given effect to them, for the reason that this would be tantamount to an improper deprivation of Lincoln's right to prosecute its suit in the District Court to full payment of the judgment. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n First. Here, New York law clearly governed the validity of the attachment proceedings. The Idaho District Court found, and it is not denied, that those proceedings complied with the formal requirements of New York's attachment statutes. But it is contended that at the time of the levy the New York court, under New York law, was without jurisdiction because the Idaho judgment was then pending on appeal and therefore contingent. Respondent points to certain New York cases which lay down the general proposition that 'an indebtedness is not attachable unless it is absolutely payable at present, or in the future and not dependable upon any contingency.' \n6\n But both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument. And indeed the New York court itself necessarily passed upon this question, adversely to respondent's contention. The garnishee's answer in the New York court disclosed that the judgment was pending on appeal, and the New York court's final judgment was not rendered, nor execution issued, until the Idaho judgment had been affirmed. By its action the New York court necessarily decided that the judgment debt was within the scope of New York's attachment laws. And none of the New York authorities to which the respondents direct our attention militate against the soundness of the New York court's ruling. On the contrary, other decisions of the New York courts lead to the conclusion that the judgment-even though on appeal-was sufficiently definite and final to bring it within the New York \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n statute. \n7\n To the same effect, in the federal courts the general rule has long been recognized that while appeal with proper supersedeas stays execution of the judgment, it does not-until and unless reversed-detract from its decisiveness and finality. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Second. Respondent's next contention is that even though Huron was compelled to pay the New York judgment as a result of attachment proceedings fully authorized by the New York statutes, the Idaho federal court not only can but should require a second payment of the same amount. The Circuit Court of Appeals so held. But since Huron, owing a judgment debt to Lincoln, paid it to a creditor of Lincoln under a valid New York judgment, it certainly should not be required to pay it a second time, except for the most compelling reasons. 'It ought to be and it is the object of courts to prevent the payment of any debt twice over.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n It has not been urged here, nor was it urged in the courts below, that Huron was guilty of any negligence, misconduct or fraud in connection with the New York judgment. It has not been claimed that there was a failure to give Lincoln notice of the New York suit against it. No federal statute or constitutional provision is invoked as supporting the contention that the Idaho federal court was under a duty to disregard the effect of the payment made by Huron under the compulsion \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n of the valid New York judgment. What is contended is that historically federal courts have carved out a rule to protect themselves from interference by state courts, and that a plaintiff in a federal court proceeding has an absolute right to prosecute his suit and collect his judgment in that court-a right which would somehow be arrested or taken away by giving effect to the New York attachment. This contention rests primarily upon a statement of this Court in Wallace v. M'Connell, 13 Pet. 136, 151. That case, a suit on a promissory note, was begun in the federal District Court for Alabama. While it was pending, a suit for collection of the note, based on its attachment, was instituted in an Alabama state court. In the state court action, though tentative judgment was rendered against the federal court defendant as garnishee, the matter was then stayed for six months because no judgment had yet been rendered against the state court defendant. At this point, therefore, actions involving the same issues were concurrently pending in both the state and the federal court without final determination in either. Before final determination of the state proceedings, the case came on for decision in the federal court. That court overruled defendant's plea based on the state court attachment. On appeal, this Court said: 'The plea shows, that the proceedings on the attachment were instituted after the commencement of this suit. The jurisdiction of the district court of the United States, and the right of the plaintiff to prosecute his suit in that court, having attached, that right could not be arrested or taken away by any proceedings in another court. This would produce a collision in the jurisdiction of courts, that would extremely embarrass the administration of justice. ... (The doctrine here announced) is essential to the protection of the rights of the garnishee.' The concrete question prosented to the Court there appears to have been nothing \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n more than a situation in which two courts were called upon to litigate the same issues at the same time. \n10\n Such is not true in this case.\n Another case relied on by respondent is Wabash Railroad Co. v. Tourville, \n179 \nU.S. 322\n, 21 S.Ct. 113. But that case, involving actions in the courts of two states rather than in a state and a federal court, as here, does not support respondent's contention. In that case this Court did not hold that state laws with reference to attachment and garnishment should not be given effect. On the contrary, it based its decision upon a holding by the Missouri appellate court that the Illinois garnishment was void for failure to comply with statutory requirements, and upon a ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court 'that the judgment was foreign to Illinois, and therefore not subject to garnishment there.' \n11\n After basing its judgment on these grounds, the Court added a last statement to the effect that 'This court has held that to the validity of a plea of attachment the attachment must have preceded the commencement of the suit in which the plea is made. Wallace v. M'Connell, 13 Pet. 136.' Whatever may be the present day effect of the principle announced in Wallace v. M'Connell and reasserted in the Tourville case, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 192]\n\u00a0\n that principle has no application here. But it is said that a broader principle, stemming from those cases, is here applicable. And it is true that some courts, both state and federal, have adopted the broader rule for which respondent contends. \n12\n The leading federal case on the subject is Thomas v. Wooldridge, 23 Fed.Cas. 986, 987, No. 13,918. The rule in that case, as announced by Justice Bradley on circuit, was that 'judgments of state and federal courts should not be subject to attachments issued by each other.' The reasons there given to support this rule were: the debt was quasi in custodia legis; attachments of it would therefore interfere with the court's dignity and prerogatives, excite jealousies and bring about conflicts of jurisdiction; many rights are still left for adjustment after judgment and therefore attachment of a court's judgment would be an inconvenient, dangerous and potentially fraud-ridden interference with judicial proceedings. Justice Bradley was also of opinion that recognition of this rule was practically compelled by Wallace v. M'Connell.\n It is our opinion that no such broad general rule exists. This does not, however, mean that a court which has rendered a judgment is without power to exercise jurisdiction, when properly invoked, to adjudicate newly asserted rights related to the judgment debt. It does mean that later opinions of this Court have undermined the basic reasoning upon which Justice Bradley relied in declaring that judgments in a federal court were never \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 193]\n\u00a0\n subject to attachment elsewhere. For it is now settled that attachment is wholly the creature of, and controlled by, the law of the state; property and persons within the state can be subjected to the operation of that local law; power over the person who owes a debt confers jurisdiction on the courts of the state where the writ of attachment issues; and by reason of the constitutional requirement that full faith and credit be given the valid actions of a state, courts of one state must recognize valid attachment judgments of other states. \n13\n And under congressional enactment federal courts must also give full faith and credit. 14 These later decisions are but a recognition of the greatly developed statutory use of attachment by the states, a development brought about by the increased nobility of persons and property and the expanded area of business relationships. Whatever may have been the necessity for the rule in other times, it does not fit its present day environment.\n Further, we do not here, as in Wallace v. M'Connell, have a case in which two courts are proceeding in the same matter at the same time. The New York court has proceeded under New York law to final judgment. It has compelled obedience to its judgment. The New York proceedings did not arrest or take away the right of Lincoln to try out its issues with Huron in the federal court for Idaho. Those issues had already been tried and determined in that court, and its jurisdiction to adjust and adjudicate newly asserted rights relating to the judgment had not been invoked. There was therefore no possibility of collision between the two courts, for similar issues were not pending before them at the same \n\n[312 \nU.S. 183, 194]\n\u00a0\n time. In fact, far from colliding with the Idaho court, the New York court accepted as final that court's determination of the issues that it had passed on. For the suit in New York was based on the Idaho judgment, and not on the original cause of action, and 'A cause of action on a judgment is different from that upon which the judgment was entered.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Both the Idaho federal court and the New York state court decided matters within the respective authority of each. To give effect to the judgment rendered in the New York attachment proceedings cannot, in any manner, interfere with the jurisdiction of the Idaho court. While the Idaho court did have authority to issue an execution for the collection of an unpaid judgment, it would not have enforced an execution for the benefit of Lincoln if the judgment had previously been paid directly to Lincoln. Nor should it issue an execution when the money was paid to Lincoln's creditors by reason of valid attachment proceedings. For this would be to exercise the jurisdiction of a federal court to render ineffective that protection which a garnishee should be afforded by reason of having obeyed a judgment rendered by a state in the exercise of its constitutional power over persons and property within its territory. \n16\n To take such a step would constitute a denial of that full faith and credit which a federal court should give to the acts of a state court. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n The District Court properly ordered that its judgment be marked satisfied, and correctly refused to render judgment on the supersedeas bond. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgments of the District Court are affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sections 902 and 903 of Art. 54 of the New York Civil Practice Act authorize courts to issue warrants of attachment against defendants shown to be foreign corporations in actions against them based on 'Breach of contract, express or implied. ...' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 233, Art. 25, New York Civil Practice Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 27 F.Supp. 720. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 9 Cir., 111 F.2d 438. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n311 \nU.S. 625\n, 61 S.Ct. 28, 85 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Herrmann & Grace v.

Miller, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a suit brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York under \n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n Section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act,1 a decree was entered on December 30, 1929, directing payment to the plaintiffs of a stated amount out of the property of a German corporation which had been seized by the Alien Property Custodian. There was no appeal and the amount awarded was paid.\n In 1938 the United States moved upon affidavits to set aside the decree contending that the court had been without jurisdiction. The District Court granted the motion upon that ground. Sorenson v. Sutherland, 27 F.Supp. 44. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the original decree. 2 Cir., 109 F.2d 714. Certiorari was granted. Jackson v. Irving Trust Co., \n310 \nU.S. 621\n, 60 S.Ct. 1103\n\n\n It appears that the suit had been brought in 1927 by John S. Sorenson and Thorlief S. B. Nielsen, as surviving partners of the firm of Crossman & Sielcken. The bill of complaint alleged that plaintiffs and Hermann Sielcken, the deceased partner, were citizens and residents of the United States; that the partnership had its principal place of business in New York City and had not at any time been a 'resident' in enemy territory and had not been an enemy or ally of enemy within the meaning of the Trading with the Enemy Act; that Zentral-Einkaufs-Gesellschaft, m.b.H., a German corporation described as Z.E.G., was indebted to Crossman & Sielcken for cargoes purchased by the latter for Z.E.G. during 1915 and consigned to neutral ports where they had been seized and condemned by the British Government; and that the Alien Property Custodian had assets of Z.E.G. which had been seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act. The bill prayed for a decree establishing the debt claimed by the plaintiffs and ordering its payment to them out of the property so held. The bill declared that it was filed pursuant to Section 9(a) of the Trading with \n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n the Enemy Act and that the court had jurisdiction to entertain it by virtue of the express terms of that provision.\n The defendants, the Alien Property Custodian defenses of Z.E.G. averred that the partnership States appeared generally. They moved to dismiss the bill on the grounds (1) that it appeared affirmatively therefrom that no debt was owing to the plaintiffs from any enemy whose property had been seized and was then held, (2) that it appeared affirmatively that no debt was owing to the plaintiffs by Z.E.G., and (3) that the plaintiffs had not stated facts sufficient to entitle them to equitable relief under the provisions of the Act. The defendants also answered denying knowledge as to the averments of the bill which set forth the citizenship and residence of the plaintiffs and Sielcken and the locus of the partnership, and those concerning the transactions said to have given rise to the debt. As an affirmative defense, it was alleged that there were prior claims to the seized property of Z.E.G. The latter being joined as defendant also answered putting in issue allegations relating to the claim and setting up various affirmative defenses. One of these asserted that plaintiffs did not have title to the cause of action, since the Alien Property Custodian was alleged to have seized the assets of Crossman & Sielcken as an enemy firm because Sielcken resided in Germany and became an enemy. Other of Z.E.G. averred that the partnership of Crossman & Sielcken had been dissolved through the outbreak of the war, and that the claim thereupon had passed to Sielcken and upon his death to his German executors who had entered into an arbitration agreement with Z. E.G., and that the arbitrators had found no liability on its part.\n On the trial, at the close of the evidence on both sides, defendants moved to dismiss upon the ground that plaintiffs had failed to prove their case. The District Court denied the motions and held that the partnership had \n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n not been dissolved by the outbreak of the war and that Z.E.G. was indebted as claimed; that the executors of Sielcken in Germany had no authority to dispose of a partnership asset which had come into existence long prior to our entering the war; and that plaintiffs were entitled to a decree for the relief prayed for. Decree was entered accordingly.\n While the present motion to vacate the decree was upon the sole ground that the court had no jurisdiction to enter it, there was some attempt in the affidavits on the motion to show that the decree was collusive. But, as the Circuit Court of Appeals observed, there was no bill of review presenting such a question and no justification for setting aside a decree upon that ground merely upon affidavits. The Government expressly disclaims any challenge to that ruling. As to the question of jurisdiction, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court upon the trial of the suit was obliged to resolve disputed questions of fact and that its decision that the jurisdictional facts were established could not be attacked collaterally. Stoll v. Gottlieb, \n305 \nU.S. 165\n, 59 S. Ct. 134; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, \n308 \nU.S. 371\n, 60 S.Ct. 317.\n Petitioner thus states the question upon which review is asked in this Court: 'Whether an unappealed judgment against the Alien Property Custodian under Section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, on a claim to recover for a debt, may be set aside for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the beneficial owner of the claim sued on was an 'enemy' as defined by that Act'.\n Petitioner argues that the judgment was void since it was not authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act and thus the suit was a suit against the United States to which the United States had not consented and over which, therefore, the District Court had no jurisdiction. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 500]\n\u00a0\n We hold the argument untenable. There is no question here of the sort presented in United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, \n309 \nU.S. 506\n, 60 S.Ct. 653, of want of consent to be sued or of an attempt on the part of officials to waive the sovereign immunity. The United States had expressly consented in Section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act that suits might be brought by a non-enemy claimant to have his claim against an enemy debtor satisfied out of the latter's property held by the Alien Property Custodian. The pertinent parts of the section are set forth in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 501]\n\u00a0\n The statute provides that any person not an enemy or ally of enemy3 'claiming' any interest or right in the property seized or to whom any debt may be owing by the alien enemy may sue the Custodian and Treasurer. He may sue 'to establish the interest, right, title, or debt so claimed'. The court is to determine whether his claim is established. If the claim is 'so established', the court is to order the delivery of property or payment 'to which the court shall determine said claimant is entitled'. Nothing could be clearer than that in a suit so brought the court is to determine every issue necessary to the establishment of the claim.\n The suit in question was precisely within the terms of the Act. It was a suit by plaintiffs Sorenson and Nielsen as surviving partners, in which they alleged their citizenship and residence in the United States ( and this does not now appear to be questioned), to recover a debt claimed to be owing to the firm by an enemy corporation. The allegations of the bill of complaint met the requirements of the statute in every respect. It \n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 502]\n\u00a0\n set forth the plaintiffs' claim, their non-enemy status, the transactions out of which their claim arose, and that they had given notice of the claim as the statute required. The denials of the answers and the affirmative defenses presented issues which the court was competent to try. All these issues were necessarily before the court in the performance of its statutory duty to determine whether the plaintiffs had established their claim to the debt. Thus, the status of the plaintiffs, of the partnership, and of Sielcken, the deceased partner, the effect of his death, his interest in the assets under the partnership agreement, the nature of the transactions with Z.E.G., whether it was indebted to the firm and whether the surviving partners were entitled to recover the debt, that is, every issue which could be litigated in the suit was by the very terms of the Act submitted to the determination of the court.\n Petitioner says that the jurisdictional point was not contested or adjudicated at the trial. That, while the defendants claimed that Sielcken was a resident of Germany at the time of the war, that he owned all the capital of the partnership, and that upon his death it was the duty of the surviving partners to pay over to his executor the capital, property and business of the firm, it was not suggested that these facts raised the jurisdictional issue. Petitioner urges that the District Judge held that while Sielcken may have been an 'enemy' as defined in the Act, 'he did not become an enemy within the meaning of the dissolution doctrine, at least so far as transactions occurring prior to the war were concerned'. And to support the argument, petitioner relies upon a colloquy between the District Judge and counsel in the course of the trial. Respondent rejoins that in the same colloquy the District Judge observed that 'the partnership agreement was between American citizens' and that it did not follow from the war and the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act that Sielcken was \n\n[311 \nU.S. 494, 503]\n\u00a0\n 'an alien enemy in the sense that a national of the country with which we are at war is an alien enemy'. And the District Judge further observed that the status of the property in question 'had become fixed prior to the war' and that it was not a consequence of the war that the partnership was so far dissolved 'as to change the rights with respect to that property'. From any point of view, the colloquy affords no adequate basis for petitioner's contention. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that when the dismissal of the suit was asked by counsel for the Government on the ground that Sielcken was an enemy under the Act, the issues thus raised were the same as those which pertained to the so-called 'jurisdictional' question of right to sue under the Trading with the Enemy Act.\n By the provisions of that Act the jurisdiction of the District Court attached when the suit was brought upon the claim which the plaintiffs as non-enemy claimants set forth. However the issues were labeled the court was authorized to determine them. Texas & Pacific Rwy. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S. F. Rwy. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 274\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 265; Stoll v. Gottlieb, supra, 305 U.S. page 171, 59 S.Ct. page 137. And whether a particular issue was actually litigated is immaterial in view of the necessary conclusion that there was full opportunity to litigate it and that it was adjudicated by the decree.

KURN(1941)\nNo. 732\nArgued: April 18, 1941Decided: May 5, 1941\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry G. Waltner, Jr., of Jefferson City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frank C. Mann, of Springfield, Mo., for respondents. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 256, 257]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n When the interstate train on which he was fireman emerged from a curve on the outskirts of Winfield, Kansas, petitioner sighted a train standing not more than six hundred feet ahead on the same track. He shouted to the engineer to push the brake valve over in emergency. The engineer turned and looked at him but did nothing to arrest the movement of the train. Petitioner jumped from his seat, crossed the cab, and stood behind the engineer for a brief time but said nothing. When the engine was but two or three car lengths from the standing train, the engineer applied the brakes. At that moment petitioner leaped from the engine and landed in some rocks along the track. He sustained serious injuries and to recover damages brought the instant action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.  51-59, 45 U.S.C.A.  51-59, against respondents in a Missouri circuit court.\n The complaint contained five counts charging negligence, but only the fourth was submitted to the jury. Count four alleged: '... that said engineer ... was further negligent in that after he was notified by ( petitioner) that the (train) was standing on said track near said crossing, he failed to immediately apply the air in the emergency, to stop said train, which negligence created a dilemma of imminent peril, which forced ( petitioner) to jump from said train in order to save his life, or some bodily harm.'\n The case was tried before a jury which returned a verdict of $12,000. From judgment in that amount entered for petitioner, respondents appealed, assigning various errors. Confining its attention to one, the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the circuit court should have granted respondents' motion for a directed \n\n[313 \nU.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n verdict. It reversed the judgment but did not remand the cause for a new trial. 144 S.W.2d 76, 79. We granted certiorari on March 10, 1941. \n312 \nU.S. 675\n, 61 S.Ct. 740, 85 L.Ed. --.\n It is conceded that the action was properly brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The single question is whether the trial court correctly refused to direct a verdict for respondents.\n In explanation of its conclusion that the trial court erred, the Supreme Court of Missouri observed: 'The burden was on (petitioner) to establish that he notified the engineer to go into emergency. He did not so notify him unless the engineer understood what was said, and there is not even a scintilla of evidence that the engineer understood that ( petitioner) said.' In other words, not only must petitioner prove that he moved to warn the engineer of the impending danger, but he must prove the engineer's subjective comprehension and correct interpretation of that warning, verbal or otherwise. We cannot agree.\n To be sure petitioner was required by the allegations of his complaint to prove that he acted promptly and reasonably to awaken the engineer to the danger ahead. Since the only count submitted to the jury charged that the engineer was negligent in failing to apply the brakes after notice of the train in front, petitioner was compelled also to prove that the notice was communicated to the engineer. But to establish the fact of communication petitioner had only to prove that the engineer  ould have comprehended the warning under the circumstances disclosed. He was not obligated to go further and produce evidence of the subjective reactions in the engineer's mind. The right of action conferred by  51 is not to be burdened with impossible conditions.\n There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that if not subject to any physical disability the engineer would have comprehended petitioner's mo- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n nition and understood that peril was imminent. Petitioner testified without contradiction that he 'hollered' his warning loudly; that only a narrow space separated his perch from the engineer's seat; that the engineer's hearing was 'all right'; that petitioner and the engineer could and did carry on 'normal conversations' while the train was operating; and that there was comparatively little noise in the cab from the train.\n Judged by the test outlined above, that evidence was ample to warrant submission of the issue to the jury. Since other questions which our decision does not touch were presented to the Supreme Court of Missouri, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJUST v. CHAMBERS(1941)\nNo. 373\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n As Amended Mar. 31, 1941. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 384]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. O. Mehrtens, of Miami, Fla., Samuel W. Fordyce and Walter R. Mayne, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Raymond Parmer, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, as executrix of the estate of Henry C. Yeiser, Jr., owner of the yacht 'Friendship II', brought this proceeding in admiralty for limitation of liability. 46 U.S.C.  183, 46 U.S.C.A.  183. Petitioners presented claims for damages for personal injuries due to carbon monoxide gas poisoning alleged to have occurred on board the vessel. It was cruising at the time within the territorial limits of the State of Florida and petitioners were guests of the owner. On the owner's death, petitioners' claims were filed against his estate.\n Upon the facts the District Court found liability to the claimants and denied limitation upon the ground of neglect of duty by the owner. The court held that under a statute of Florida the claimants' causes of action survived the owner's death.\n Upon appeal from the interlocutory decree, 28 U.S.C.  227, 28 U.S.C. A.  227, the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that all the findings of fact made by the District Judge were supported by the evidence; that, as the injuries thus proved were not occasioned without the knowledge or privity of the shipowner, respondent could not have limitation; that as the ship was at fault as well as the owner the causes of action in rem survived the owner's death and the claimants on that ground might recover up to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n the value of the ship, but that under the governing principles of admiralty law the personal liability of the owner did not survive. The Friendship II, 5 Cir., 113 F.2d 105. Because of the importance of the question as to the enforceability in admiralty of the claims for personal injuries against the estate of the deceased tortfeasor, we granted certiorari. October 21, 1940. Just v. Chambers, \n311 \nU.S. 634\n, 61 S.Ct. 63, 85 L.Ed. --.\n In support of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, respondent asks us to review the evidence with respect to the cause of the claimants' injuries and the breach of duty by the shipowner, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings. Applying the well-established rule, we accept the concurrent findings of the courts below upon these matters (Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 429) and we confine our attention to the question of the survival of the causes of action.\n There is no question that there was a maritime tort. There is also no question that the injury occurred within the territorial limits of Florida and that under the local statute, as construed by the Supreme Court of the State, the causes of action survived against the wrongdoer's estate. This was recognized by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 Cir., 113 F.2d at page 107. Compiled General Laws of Florida 1927, Section 4211; Waller v.

Norwich & N. Y. Transp. Company v. Wright, 13 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n Wall. 104, 121. It looks to a complete disposition of what may be a 'many cornered controversy', thus applying to proceedings in rem against the ship as well as to proceedings in personam against the owner, the limitation extending to the owner's property as well as to his person.

Boston Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 527, 552\n, 9 S.Ct. 612, 617; The Albert Dumois, \n177 \nU.S. 240, 259\n, 20 S.Ct. 595, 602. The limitation extends to tort claims even when the tort is non-maritime. Richardson v. Harmon, \n222 \nU.S. 96\n, 32 S.Ct. 27.\n When the jurisdiction of the court in admiralty has attached through a petition for limitation, the jurisdiction to determine claims is not lost merely because the shipowner fails to establish his right to limitation. We have said that the court of admiralty in such a proceeding acquires the right to marshal all claims, whether of strictly admiralty origin or not, and to give effect to them by the apportionment of the res and by judgment in personam against the owner, so far as the court may decree. And that, if Congress has this constitutional power, it necessarily follows, as incidental to that power, that it may furnish a complete remedy for the satisfaction of those claims by distribution of the res and by judgments in personam for deficiencies against the owner, if he is not released by virtue of the statute. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., supra, 273 U.S. at page 217, 47 S. Ct. at page 359. While it is recognized that the equitable rule for retaining jurisdiction in order completely to dispose of a cause does not usually apply in admiralty, the proceeding for limitation of liability is different from the ordinary admiralty suit and, by reason of the statute and rules governing it, the court of admiralty has authority to grant an injunction and thus bring litigants \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n into the admiralty court. There is thus jurisdiction to fulfill the obligation to do equity to claimants by furnishing them a complete remedy although limitation is refused. Id., 273 U.S. at page 218, 47 S.Ct. at page 360.\n But respondent contends that to permit recovery upon the claims here in question would do violence to a precept of the admiralty law that causes of action for personal injury die with the person. Respondent argues that the source of this principle was not the common law1 but the civil law2 and that it should be regarded as an integral part of the maritime law, considered as an independent body of law, and hence can be changed only by Congress which has not acted. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Whether the particular rule now invoked is so securely based in our maritime law4 that a different one can be established only by legislation and not by the exercise of the judicial power responding to present standards of justice, 5 we need not now consider. For, while the injury occurred on navigable waters, these were within the limits of Florida whose legislation provided that the cause of action should survive. And it is not a principle of our maritime law that a court of admiralty must invariably refuse to recognize and enforce a liability which \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 388]\n\u00a0\n the State has established in dealing with a maritime subject. On the contrary, there are numerous instances in which the general maritime law has been modified or supplemented by state action, as e.g. in creating liens for repairs or supplies furnished to a vessel in her home port. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 580; The J. E. Rumbell, \n148 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S.Ct. 498, 500.6 With respect to maritime torts we have held that the State may modify or supplement the maritime law by creating liability which a court of admiralty will recognize and enforce when the state action is not hostile to the characteristic features of the maritime law or inconsistent with federal legislation. The City of Norwalk, D.C., 55 F. 98; Western Fuel Company v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233, 242\n, 42 S.Ct. 89, 90; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479\n, 43 S.Ct. 418; Vancouver Steamship Co. v. Rice, \n288 \nU.S. 445\n, 53 S.Ct. 420.7\n This is illustrated, in the cases cited, by the effect given in admiralty to state legislation creating liability for wrongful death. The leading continental States of Europe, whose jurisprudence was developed from the civil law have given a remedy in such a case,8 but a right of action was denied by the common law and likewise by the admiralty in England. And this Court, upon an elaborate review of the decisions, concluded that no suit for wrongful death would lie 'in the courts of the United States under the general maritime law'. The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199, 213\n, 7 S.Ct. 140, 146. See, also, The Corsair, \n145 \nU.S. 335, 344\n, 12 S.Ct. 949, 951. The absence of a federal or state \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 389]\n\u00a0\n statute giving a right of action was emphasized. But when a State, acting within its province, has created liability for wrongful death, the admiralty will enforce it.\n There was a careful and comprehensive exposition of this subject by Judge Addison Brown in The City of Norwalk, supra, decided shortly after The Corsair, supra. He observed that if it was not within the power of the State to create such a liability in a maritime case, the statutes of the majority of the States would be void so far as they related to deaths in cases arising on navigable waters. But the validity of judgments in the state courts giving damages in such cases, and the validity of the statutes on which they rested, had been sustained. American Steamboat Company v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522; Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 \nU.S. 99\n. The grounds of objection to the admiralty jurisdiction in enforcing liability for wrongful death were similar to those urged here; that is, that the Constitution presupposes a body of maritime law, that this law, as a matter of interstate and international concern, requires harmony in its administration and cannot be subject to defeat or impairment by the diverse legislation of the States, and hence that Congress alone can make any needed changes in the general rules of the maritime law. But these contentions proved unavailing and the principle was maintained that a State, in the exercise of its polie power, may establish rules applicable on land and water within its limits, even though these rules incidentally affect maritime affairs, provided that the state action 'does not contravene any acts of Congress, nor work any prejudice to the characteristic features of the maritime law, nor interfere with its proper harmony and uniformity in its international and interstate relations'. It was decided that the state legislation encountered none of these objections. The many instances in which state action had created new rights, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 390]\n\u00a0\n recognized and enforced in admiralty, were set forth in The City of Norwalk, and reference was also made to the numerous local regulations under state authority concerning the navigation of rivers and harbors. There was the further pertinent observation that the maritime law was not a complete and perfect system9 and that in all maritime countries there is a considerable body of municipal law that underlies the maritime law as the basis of its administration. These views find abundant support in the history of the maritime law and in the decisions of this Court.\n In The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398\n, 28 S.Ct. 133, there was a proceeding in admiralty for limitation of liability in respect of a collision on the high seas, both vessels belonging to corporations of the State of Delaware. The Court held that a Delaware statute giving damages for wrongful death was a valid exercise of the legislative power, and that there was thus created a personal liability of the owner to the claimants which admiralty would respect. Moreover, as the case was one for limitation of liability, the Court noted that the federal statute had enabled the owner to transfer liability to a fund and to the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty and hence 'all claims to which the admiralty does not deny existence' must be recognized. In La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95, 139\n, 28 S.Ct. 664, 680, also a limited liability proceeding, the reasoning of The Hamilton was followed in the ruling that, as the case was one of a French vessel and the law of France gave a right of action for wrongful death, our court of admiralty would enforce the claim.\n Finally, in Western Fuel Company v. Garcia, supra (\n257 \nU.S. 233\n, 42 S. Ct. 90), the Court deemed it to be the logical result of prior decisions that where death 'follows from a maritime tort committed on navigable waters within a state whose statutes give a right of action on account of death by \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n wrongful act, the admiralty courts will entertain a libel in personam for the damages sustained by those to whom such right is given'. The libel there failed solely because suit was barred by the state statute of limitations. And the criterion applied in determining the validity and effect of the state legislation was set forth in substantially the same terms as those stated in The City of Norwalk, above quoted. Western Fuel Company v. Garcia, supra, 257 U.S. at page 242, 42 S.Ct. at page 90.\n This criterion is manifestly not limited to cases of wrongful death. It is a broad recognition of the authority of the States to create rights and liabilities with respect to conduct within their borders, when the state action does not run counter to federal laws or the essential features of an exclusive federal jurisdiction. See Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 402-410, 33 S.Ct. 729, 741-744, 48 L.R.A.,N.S ., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. We see no reason why, under this test, the Florida rule in providing for the survival of a cause of action against a deceased tortfeasor for injuries occurring on navigable waters within the limits of the State should not be applied.\n Respondent argues that, in relation to wrongful death, the maritime law had left the matter 'untouched' (The Harrisburg, supra) and thus the state law was admitted to supplement the maritime law, while in the instant case there is a positive rule of admiralty against the survival of the cause of action. That is, in the one case, there is said to be a 'void' in the maritime law, which the state law may fill, while in the other there is an attempt to modify an existing principle. This is a subtlety which we think does not merit judicial adoption. The admiralty rule in the case of wrongful death can be stated either negatively or positively, and the result does not turn on the mere mode of expression. The pith of the matter is that the maritime law, as we conceived it, did not permit recovery, and in the same sense, in substance, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 383, 392]\n\u00a0\n the maritime law denied the survival of causes of action against a deceased tortfeasor. The maritime law would be supplemented or modified by state legislation in the one case as truly as in the other, and either supplement or modification is permissible in accordance with the accepted criterion.\n Our decisions in the wrongful death cases also meet the further argument which is addressed to lack of uniformity. For whatever lack of uniformity there may be in giving effect to the state rule as to survival is equally present when the state rule is applied to wrongful death, or, for that matter, in any case when state legislation is upheld in its dealing with local concerns in the absence of federal legislation. Uniformity is required only when the essential features of an exclusive federal jurisdiction are involved. But as admiralty takes cognizance of maritime torts, there is no repugnancy to its characteristic features either in permitting recovery for wrongful death or in allowing compensation for a wrong to the living to be obtained from a tortfeasor's estate. A fortiori, in applying the established rules as to proof of claims in limitation proceedings, petitioners, brought into admiralty, were entitled to have their claims against the shipowner's estate heard and determined.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to the rule in the common law, see Holdsworth's History of English Law, Vol. 3, pp. 576-578. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Inst.

MARYLAND CAS. CO. OF BALTIMORE, MD.(1941)\nNo. 349\nArgued: February 5, 1941Decided: February 17, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Glenn O. Young, of Sapulpa, Okl., and Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. W. E. Green, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent Maryland Casualty Co.\n Mr. Heber Finch, of Sapulpa, Okl., for respondents Mrs. Ethel Riddler and others. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 377, 378]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This controversy has its origin in a probate proceeding in an Oklahoma court. Petitioner, E. A. Kelleam, was administrator in that proceeding. Respondent, Maryland Casualty Company, was surety on his bond. The probate court held that all of decedent's property was a maternal ancestral estate to which the full-blood heirs, E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard, were entitled to the exclusion of the half-blood heirs, the individual respondents here. Such distribution was ordered and the administrator and Maryland Casualty Company were discharged from further liability. No appeal was taken; but shortly thereafter the half-blood heirs brought an action in the Oklahoma court to set aside that decree, alleging that petitioners E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard had perpetrated a fraud upon the probate court and that the half-bloods were entitled to participation, the estate being a general not an ancestral estate. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained and an appeal was taken to the Oklahoma District Court where it is now pending. After that suit had been commenced1 respondent-surety, learning that E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard had transferred some of the property received from the estate,2 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n brought this suit in the United States District Court, joining the full- bloods and the half-bloods as defendants and invoking federal jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship. In this suit in equity3 respondent-surety sought exoneration on its bond, alleged that its remedy at law was inadequate, and prayed that a receiver be appointed to preserve the decedent's property pending the outcome of the dispute between the heirs, and that the parties be required to set up whatever claims they might have to the property. By their answer and cross-petition, the half- bloods renewed their claims of fraud in the probate decree and joined in the prayer for the appointment of a receiver. The answers of petitioners alleged, inter alia, lack of jurisdiction in the federal court by reason of the action in the state court; and they moved to strike the cross- petition for lack of jurisdiction. By an amendment to its bill respondent- surety added allegations charging fraud in the probate decree. The District Court found that petitioners E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard, knowing of the existence of the other heirs, fraudulently concealed those facts from the probate court, gave no notice to the other heirs as required by law, and represented that E. A. Kelleam was a resident of Oklahoma when he was not; that the administrator failed to appoint a service agent as required by Oklahoma statutes; that the estate was fraudulently represented as an ancestral estate and that petitioners E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard in furtherance of the plan to defraud the half- bloods consummated a settlement with some of them in exchange for their agreement not to contest the probate decree; that that decree, having been obtained by fraud, was void as to the half-bloods; that the intermediate conveyances by petitioners E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard were fraudulent; that the remaining assets of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n the estate were in danger of being dissipated; that respondent-surety would become liable to the half-bloods for failure of the administrator to perform his duties; and that the property should be preserved pending a final order of accounting. Accordingly, it appointed a receiver, decreed that respondent-surety was entitled to exoneration by having designated property applied to the satisfaction of the interests of the half-bloods, decreed that the half-bloods were owners of designated undivided interests in the estate, established a lien thereon, and ordered petitioners E. A. Kelleam and Nell Southard to account. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 10 Cir., 112 F.2d 940. We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 627\n, 61 S. Ct. 48, 85 L.Ed. --, because of the challenged propriety of the action of the District Court in appointing a receiver and in adjudicating matters at issue in the state court.\n We think the bill should have been dismissed.\n The essential purpose of the bill was to secure the appointment of a receiver so as to conserve the property and to impress it with a lien for the surety's protection. The surety had no stake in the outcome of the dispute among the heirs beyond its contingent right to exoneration. In this posture of the case it is manifest that respondent-surety sought the receivership not as a means to an end but as an end in itself. The receivership was ancillary only in the sense that it was protective of the surety whatever the future outcome of the controversy between the heirs. The surety was not presently liable on its bond; its liability and its right to exoneration were wholly contingent, being dependent on a successful attack on the probate decree by the half-bloods. That attack was currently being made in the state court.\n Accordingly, a receiver should not have been appointed. The error in the appointment was not a question of authority but of propriety. Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 96 A.L. R. 1166; Gordon v. Washington, \n295 \nU.S. 30\n, 55 S.Ct. 584. As this \n\n[312 \nU.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n Court stated in the Gordon case (295 U.S. page 37, 55 S.Ct. page 588): 'A receivership is only a means to reach some legitimate end sought through the exercise of the power of a court of equity. It is not an end in itself.' Receiverships for conservation of property 'are to be watched with jealous eyes lest their function be perverted.' Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334, 345\n, 52 S.Ct. 512, 515. This Court has frequently admonished that a federal court of equity should not appoint a receiver where the appointment is not a remedy auxiliary to some primary relief which is sought and which equity may appropriately grant. Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, 331; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491\n, 43 S.Ct. 454; Gordon v. Washington, supra. And the reasons for such restraint are reinforced where the rights to the property sought to be conserved by a receivership are being litigated in a state court. Cf. Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 189\n, 55 S.Ct. 386; Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra. There was here no accrued right of the surety as respects the enforcement of which the receivership was an ancillary remedy, its right to exoneration being wholly contingent. \n4\n The existence of any right to exoneration was dependent on the outcome of the action which was pending in the Oklahoma court. In view of those circumstances, equity practice does not sanction the use of a conservation receivership to protect such a claim. Furthermore, from all that appears, the surety could be adequately protected in the cause pending in the Oklahoma court by provisional remedies or otherwise.\n Respondent-surety contends that under Oklahoma statutes a surety may obtain indemnity against his prin- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n cipal even before the debt is due and receive the protection of various provisional remedies. Even so, a 'remedial right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity cannot be enlarged by a state statute.' Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, supra, 261 U.S. page 497, 43 S.Ct. 456.\n For these reasons, the appointment of the receiver was an abuse of discretion.\n Since respondent-surety had no present claim to relief on its own behalf in the federal court, that court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the full-bloods and the half-bloods. Even if, on this record, the presence of respondent-surety would support a claim to diversity of citizenship, that diversity was lacking as between the other parties. Hence once the bill of complaint were dismissed, no jurisdiction would remain for any grant of relief under the cross-petition. See Kromer v. Everett Imp. Co., C.C., 110 F. 22. And even if the bill be construed as drawing in issue the merits of the controversy between the heirs which the federal court had jurisdiction to adjudicate within the rule of Arrowsmith v. Gleason, \n129 \nU.S. 86\n, 9 S.Ct. 237, and Sutton v. English, \n246 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, 38 S.Ct. 254, 256, that court could not with propriety proceed. A case involving that very controversy was pending in the Oklahoma court. That case did not involve simply an in personam action. Cf. Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077. It involved an adjudication of rights to specific property distributed pursuant to a probate decree. Cf. Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, 294 U.S. at page 195, 55 S.Ct. at page 388. The federal court therefore should not have asserted its authority.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1941)\nNo. 371\nArgued: January 10, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ferdinand T. Weil and J. Smith Christy, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners.\n Mr. Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is companion to Helvering v. Le Gierse, \n312 \nU.S. 531\n, 61 S. Ct. 646, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day. In all material respects the facts are alike except for the differences to be noted. Here the annuity contract provided for annual payments of $390.84 and cost decedent $3,258. 20. The 'insurance' policy stipulated for payment of $20,000 to decedent's daughter at de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n cedent's death, and the single premium was $17,941.80. Decedent was 74 at the time the contract was executed and died about two years later. Proceeding on the same theory as in the Le Gierse case, the Commissioner assessed a deficiency in the federal estate tax which the Board of Tax Appeals reversed. 39 B.T.A. 1047. The Circuit Court of Appeals in turn reversed the Board of Tax Appeals. 3 Cir., 113 F.2d 833. The case is here because of conflict with the Le Gierse case (2 Cir., 110 F.2d 734). \n311 \nU.S. 630\n, 61 S.Ct. 50, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioners contend that this case is distinguishable from the Le Gierse case because here the insurance company found that the total consideration for the two contracts, which was 106% of the face value of the policy, was inadequate. They point out that the rate for this combination of contracts was later increased to 108% and finally to 110%. Further, they contend that absence of physical examination does not establish absence of risk, and that the Board of Tax Appeals found that there was 'some' risk to the insurance company.\n We find the distinctions insufficient to require a different result.\n It is not enough to show that the insurance company assumed 'some' risk. A bank assumes a risk when it accepts a depositor's funds and invests them. The investment may prove to be an unsafe one, or the bank may have agreed to pay the depositor a higher rate of interest than it can profitably earn on the funds it invests. Indisputably this is a risk. But it is not an insurance risk in the sense explained in the Le Gierse case. That the insurance company subsequently changed the total charge for this particular combination of contracts because it was unprofitable does not establish the existence of an insurance risk. Rather, it illustrates strikingly the interrelation of the two agreements and emphasizes the effort of the company to remove all possible investment risk. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n Absence of a physical examination may well be inconclusive as to the existence of an insurance risk. For example, some companies do not require such an examination for group insurance. But there the risk as to one is distributed among the group, an insurance risk squarely within the definition stated in the Le Gierse case. Here the annuity issued with the policy did more than substitute for a physical examination. It removed the necessity for any risk distribution and completely countervailed a risk otherwise assumed in the 'insurance' policy.\n The finding by the Board of Tax Appeals that there was some risk necessarily is ambiguous in view of their finding that the company annually earned from 3 1\/2 to 4 percent on its own investments. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the 'risk' referred to was a risk that the funds might not earn enough to cover profitably the annuity payable to the decedent, or a risk due to a miscalculation of the proper total consideration. In either event it is not a finding of the existence of an insurance risk.\n Since the case is not distinguishable from Helvering v. Le Gierse, supra, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS think the judgment should be reversed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Commissioner v. Le Gierse, 110 F.2d 734. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKLAXON CO. v. STENTOR ELECTRIC MFG. CO.(1941)\nNo. 741\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 488]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Thomas Smith, of New York City, and James D. Carpenter, Jr., of Jersey City, N.J., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Murray C. Bernays, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 494]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The principal question in this case is whether in diversity cases the federal courts must follow conflict of laws rules prevailing in the states in which they sit. We left this open in Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Company, \n304 \nU.S. 202\n, 208, note 2, 58 S.Ct. 860, 862. The frequent recurrence of the problem, as well as the conflict of approach to the problem between the Third Circuit's opinion here and that of the First Circuit in Sampson v. Channell, 110 F.2d 754, 759-762, 128 A.L.R. 394, led us to grant certiorari.\n In 1918 respondent, a New York corporation, transferred its entire business to petitioner, a Delaware corporation. Petitioner contracted to use its best efforts to further the manufacture and sale of certain patented devices covered by the agreement, and respondent was to have a share of petitioner's profits. The agreement was executed in New York, the assets were transferred there, and petitioner began performance there although later it moved its operations to other states. Respondent was voluntarily dissolved under New York law in 1919. Ten years later it instituted this action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that petitioner had failed to perform its agreement to use its best efforts. Jurisdiction rested on diversity of citizenship. In 1939 respondent recovered a jury verdict of $100,000, upon which judgment was entered. Respondent then moved to correct the judgment by adding in- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 495]\n\u00a0\n terest at the rate of six percent from June 1, 1929, the date the action had been brought. The basis of the motion was the provision in section 480 of the New York Civil Practice Act directing that in contract actions interest be added to the principal sum 'whether theretofore liquidated or unliquidated.' \n1\n The District Court granted the motion, taking the view that the rights of the parties were governed by New York law and that under New York law the addition of such interest was mandatory. 30 F.Supp. 425, 431. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 3 Cir., 115 F.2d 268, 275, and we granted certiorari, limited to the question whether section 480 of the New York Civil Practice Act is applicable to an action in the federal court in Delaware. \n312 \nU.S. 674\n, 61 S.Ct. 734, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the view that under New York law the right to interest before verdict under section 480 went to the substance of the obligation, and that proper construction of the contract in suit fixed New York as the place of performance. It then concluded that section 480 was applicable to the case because 'it is clear by what we think is undoubtedly the better view of the law that the rules for ascertaining the measure of damages are not a matter of procedure at all, but are \n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 496]\n\u00a0\n matters of substance which should be settled by reference to the law of the appropriate state according to the type of case being tried in the forum. The measure of damages for breach of a contract is determined by the law of the place of performance; Restatement, Conflict of Laws  413.' The court referred also to section 418 of the Restatement, which makes interest part of the damages to be determined by the law of the place of performance. Application of the New York statute apparently followed from the court's independent determination of the 'better view' without regard to Delaware law, for no Delaware decision or statute was cited or discussed.\n We are of opinion that the prohibition declared in Erie Railroad v. T mpkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, against such independent determinations by the federal courts extends to the field of conflict of laws. The conflict of laws rules to be applied by the federal court in Delaware must conform to those prevailing in Delaware's state courts. 2 Otherwise the accident of diversity of citizenship would constantly disturb equal administration of justice in coordinate state and federal courts sitting side by side. See Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, supra, 304 U.S. at 74-77, 58 S.Ct. at 820-822, 114 A.L.R. 1487. Any other ruling would do violence to the principle of uniformity within a state upon which the Tompkins decision is based. Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. It is not for the federal courts to thwart such local policies by enforcing an independent 'general law' of conflict of laws. Subject only to review by this Court \n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 497]\n\u00a0\n on any federal question that may arise, Delaware is free to determine whether a given matter is to be governed by the law of the forum or some other law. Cf. Milwaukee County v. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 231. This Court's views are not the decisive factor in determining the applicable conflicts rule. Cf. Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., \n290 \nU.S. 163\n, 54 S.Ct. 134. And the proper function of the Delaware federal court is to ascertain what the state law is, not what it ought to be.\n Besides these general considerations, the traditional treatment of interest in diversity cases brought in the federal courts points to the same conclusion. Section 966 of the Revised Statutes, 28 U.S.C.  811, 28 U.S.C.A.  811, relating to interest on judgments, provides that it be calculated from the date of judgment at such rate as is allowed by law on judgments recovered in the courts of the state in which the court is held. In Massachusetts Benefit Association v. Miles, \n137 \nU.S. 689\n, page 691, 11 S.Ct. 234, page 235, this Court held that section 966 did not exclude the allowance of interest on verdicts as well as judgments, and the opinion observed that 'the courts of the state and the federal courts sitting within the state should be in harmony upon this point'.\n Looking then to the Delaware cases, petitioner relies on one group to support his contention that the Delaware state courts would refuse to apply section 480 of the New York Civil Practice Act, and respondent on another to prove the contrary. We make no analysis of these Delaware decisions, but leave this for the Circuit Court of Appeals when the case is remanded.\n Respondent makes the further argument that the judgment must be affirmed because, under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, Art. 4,  1, the state courts of Delaware would be obliged to give effect to the New York statute. The argument rests mainly on the decision of this Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Yates, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 487, 498]\n\u00a0\n \n299 \nU.S. 178\n, 57 S.Ct. 129, where a New York statute was held such an integral part of a contract of insurance that Georgia was compelled to sustain the contract under the full faith and credit clause. Here, however, section 480 of the New York Civil Practice Act is in no way related to the validity of the contract in suit, but merely to an incidental item of damages, interest, with respect to which courts at the forum have commonly been free to apply their own or some other law as they see fit. Nothi g in the Constitution ensures unlimited extraterritorial recognition of all statutes or of any statute under all circumstances. Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n306 \nU.S. 493\n, 59 S.Ct. 629; Kryger v. Wilson, \n242 \nU.S. 171\n, 37 S.Ct. 34. The full faith and credit clause does not go so far as to compel Delaware to apply section 480 if such application would interfere with its local policy.\n Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for decision in conformity with the law of Delaware.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 480, New York Civil Practice Act: 'Interest to be included in recovery. Where in any action, except as provided in section four hundred eighty-a, final judgment is rendered for a sum of money awarded by a verdict, report or decision, interest upon the total amount awarded, from the time when the verdict was rendered or the report or decision was made to the time of entering judgment, must be computed by the clerk, added to the total amount awarded, and included in the amount of the judgment.

Williams, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the Superior Court of California for Los Angeles County. The Supreme Court of California, affirmed the judgment March 21, 1939, two judges dissenting. \n1\n A rehearing was granted, the case was reargued and, October 5, 1939, the decision was reaffirmed and the former opinion adopted and amplified, two justices dissenting. \n2\n No question arising under the Constitution of the United States had been raised or decided. In a second petition for rehearing the petitioner, for the first time, asserted that his conviction violated the Fourteenth Amendment. November 3, 1939, the Court ruled: 'The petition for a rehearing herein is denied.'\n The Chief Justice of the State allowed an appeal November 6, 1939, and November 8, 1939, executed a certificate in which he enumerated the constitutional questions presented by the second petition for rehearing; stated that the court entertained the petition, and explicitly overruled each of the contentions made therein; certified \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n that the decision denying rehearing 'is to be interpreted and considered as holding against the appellant's contention that his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ... were violated'; and concluded: 'It ordered that this certificate be filed in this court and made part of the record on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.' On the record so made this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant did not draw in question the constitutional validity of any statute of California. We, therefore, dismissed the appeal4 but, treating the papers as a petition for certiorari,5 we granted the writ. This case is No. 4.\n October 31, 1939, the petitioner prayed the Supreme Court of California for a writ of habeas corpus on the theory that his trial and conviction had deprived him of his life without due process. He submitted affidavits of one Hope, who had turned state's evidence against him. In these Hope asserted that his testimony was false, had been coerced by threats and induced by promises of leniency and by fraud.\n November 9, 1939, habeas corpus was denied, without prejudice. The Chief Justice of California allowed an appeal and made, and ordered filed of record, a certificate respecting the constitutional questions presented and decided by the court, similar to that entered in No. 4. We followed the same course as in No. 4 and the case is here as No. 5.\n The appeals were presented in forma pauperis. The typewritten record is of great length. In the belief that \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n only by briefs and oral argument, and on a record printed by the court, could proper consideration and decision be had of certain apparently important questions presented, we issued the writs. The cases were argued at the October 1940 term, and the judgments were affirmed by a divided Court. A petition for rehearing before a full Court was granted, the affirmances set aside, and the causes set for rehearing at this term. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner, who used, and was commonly known by, the name of Robert S. James (and will be so called), and one Hope were indicted May 6, 1936, for the murder of James' wife on August 5, 1935. Hope pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. James pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. The trial was a long one in which the petitioner made objections to rulings and to the charge, which raise questions of state law decided by the opinion below, with which we have no concern. We shall refer only to so much of the evidence as bears upon the constitutional questions open here.\n The State's theory is that the petitioner conceived the plan of marrying, insuring his wife's life by policies providing double indemnity for accidental death, killing her in a manner to give the appearance of accident, and collecting double indemnity.\n James employed Mary E. Busch as a manicurist in his barber shop in March, 1935, and, about a month later, went through a marriage ceremony with her, which was not legal as he then had a living wife. While they were affianced, insurance was negotiated on her life, with James as beneficiary. Upon the annulment of the earlier marriage a lawful ceremony was performed. The petitioner made sure that the policies were not annulled by the fact that when they were issued Mary had not been his lawful wife. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n The allegation is that James enlisted one Hope in a conspiracy to do away with Mary and collect and divide the insurance on her life. Hope testified that, at James' instigation, he procured rattlesnakes which were to bite and kill Mary; that they appeared not to be sufficiently venomous for the purpose but he ultimately purchased others and delivered them to James; that James, on August 4, 1935, blindfolded his wife's eyes, tied her to a table, had Hope bring one of the snakes into the room and caused the reptile to bite her foot; that, during the night James told Hope the bite did not have the desired effect and, in the early morning of August 5, he told Hope that he was going to drown his wife; that later he said to Hope, 'That is that', and still later, at his request, Hope aided him in carrying the body to the yard, and James placed the body face down at the edge of a fish pond with the head and shoulders in the water.\n James was at his barber shop on August 5. On that evening he took two friends home for dinner. When they arrived the house was dark and empty, and, upon a search of the grounds, his wife's body was found in the position indicated. An autopsy showed the lungs were almost filled with water. The left great toe showed a puncture and the left leg was greatly swollen and almost black. Nothing came of the investigation of the death.\n James attempted to collect double indemnity; the insurers refused to pay; suits were instituted and one of them settled. As a result of this activity, a fresh investigation of Mary James' death was instituted. On April 19, 1936, officers arrested James for the crime of incest. He was booked on this charge on the morning of April 21, was given a hearing and remanded to jail. On May 2 and 3 he made statements respecting his wife's death to the prosecuting officials.\n At the trial, in addition to that of Hope, testimony was adduced as to the finding and condition of the body, other \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n evidence to connect James with the death, and expert testimony that the condition of the left leg could be attributed to rattlesnake bites. The purchase of snakes by Hope was proved by him and several other witnesses one of whom said he sold the two snakes to Hope, one of which Hope claimed had bitten Mary James. Two snakes were brought into court which the witness identified as those sold to Hope and by Hope resold to the witness.\n James' statements were offered in evidence. Objection was made that they were not voluntary. Before they were admitted the trial judge heard testimony offered by the State and the defendant on that issue. He ruled that the confessions were admissible, and they were received in evidence.\n The State offered evidence with respect to the death of a former wife of James in 1932. This tended to prove that, while driving down Pike's Peak, their automobile went off the road. James went for aid. When the persons called upon reached the automobile they found James' wife lying partly outside the car with her head badly crushed and a bloody hammer in the back of the car. James appeared unhurt. The woman recovered from her injuries but, shortly afterwards, was discovered by James and another man drowned in the bathtub in a house James had temporarily leased at Colorado Springs. James collected double indemnity from insurance companies for her death, the insurance having been placed at about the time he married her and her death having occurred within a few months thereafter. This evidence was admitted over objection and, at the close of the State's case, defendant's counsel moved for an adjournment so that they might take depositions of witnesses in Colorado. The court refused the application for want of a sufficient showing.\n The petitioner's contentions, based upon the Fourteenth Amendment, are: that the conduct of the prosecuting \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n officials and police officers denied him the equal protection of the laws; that his conviction deprived him of his life without due process, because the testimony of Hope, an accomplice, was not corroborated as required by the Penal Code of California and was, therefore, insufficient to sustain a conviction; because Hope's affidavits filed since the trial showed that his testimony was obtained by deceit, fraud, collusion, and coercion and was known to the prosecutor to be false and hence the trial was a mere pretense; because the alleged occurrences in Colorado were wholly disconnected from the crime charged and petitioner was afforded no opportunity to answer the State's evidence respecting them; because the production of the rattlesnakes in the court was solely for the purpose of inflaming the jury; and because physical violence, threats, and other coercive means produced the confessions, and denial of requested opportunity to consult counsel preceded and accompanied their procurement.\n First. The contention that illegal conduct on the part of the State's officers deprived petitioner of the equal protection of the laws hardly needs notice. The claim is that where officers violate the law so that some defendants are treated as was petitioner, and others are treated as the law requires, inequality and discrimination results which denies equal protection. The contention is frivolous. The record is bare of any proof to support it.\n Second. The petitioner asserts that Hope's testimony was not corroborated. Under California law, the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is not sufficient to sustain a conviction. \n7\n Petitioner contends that, in consideration of Hope's confessing and turning state's evidence, leniency was extended him by the court. Petitioner says that Hope's affidavits show that the prosecuting officials well knew that Hope's testimony was a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n fabrication; that he was persuaded so to testify by fraud, promises of leniency and threats, and the trial was a mere sham. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n These contentions need but brief notice. The Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid a state court to construe and apply its laws with respect to the evidence of an accomplice. There is no adequate showing that there was a corrupt bargain with Hope, and the practice of taking into consideration, in sentencing an accomplice, his aid to the state in turning state's evidence can be no denial of due process to a convicted confederate. Hope's affidavits not only were prepared after the State Supreme Court had passed upon the case and its opinion had been published but after the lapse of nearly three years from the trial. They could, therefore, be considered only in the habeas corpus case. The State contends that it had no opportunity to answer them. This is contested by the petitioner. In any event, it was stipulated that the record on appeal in the other case should be part of the record on the habeas corpus hearing; and comparison of the testimony at the trial with the allegations of the affidavits raises serious doubts as to their truthfulness. The appraisal of the conflicting evidence was for the court below. Even if its refusal to believe Hope's depositions were erroneous, the error would be no more a denial of due process than was its approval, on appeal, of the trial judge's refusal to direct a verdict on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.\n Third. Testimony was admitted concerning the death of James' former wife, on the widely recognized principle that similar but disconnected acts may be shown to establish intent, design, and system. \n9\n The Fourteenth Amendment leaves California free to adopt a rule of relevance \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n which the court below holds was applied here in accordance with the State's law.\n The insistence that the trial judge's refusal to grant a continuance, so that petitioner could take answering depositions, was a denial of due process goes even farther afield. Counsel had notice at the opening of the trial, or shortly thereafter, that the State intended to introduce evidence on this subject,-but waited until the State had rested before asking the continuance. Even then the showing was inadequate as to the identity of the witnesses and the nature of the expected evidence. The judge, in the exercise of his discretion, denied the motion. The Fourteenth Amendment gives this Court no mandate to review his action or inquire whether he abused his discretion in such a field.\n Fourth. A part of the State's case was that Hope had purchased snakes and brought them to the petitioner in pursuance of the conspiracy. Two snakes were brought into the courtroom to be identified by the witness who said he sold them to Hope. The petitioner says that the sole purpose of the production of the snakes was to prejudice the jury against him and that those in the courtroom, including the jury, were in a panic as a result of the incident. For this he cites current newspaper accounts and affidavits of his counsel. The State denies any improper purpose and, to rebut the assertions of petitioner, relies on a counter-affidavit and a statement by the trial judge. The record discloses that at a subsequent state of the trial the snakes were brought into court at the defendant's request.\n We do not sit to review state court action on questions of the propriety of the trial judge's action in the admission of evidence. We cannot hold, as petitioner urges, that the introduction and identification of the snakes so infused the trial with unfairness as to deny due process of law. The fact that evidence admitted as relevant by \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n a court is shocking to the sensibilities of those in the courtroom cannot, for that reason alone, render its reception a violation of due process.\n Fifth. The important question is whether the use of the confessions rendered petitioner's conviction a deprivation of his life without due process of law. Recital of the relevant facts is essential to a decision.\n The petitioner, while having almost no formal education, is a man of intelligence and business experience. After his arrest, on the charge of incest, on the morning of Sunday, April 19, 1936, he was taken for a short time to the adjoining house and shown a dictaphone there installed. He was brought to the District Attorney's offices where he was lodged in the Bureau of Investigation. He says that during the two or three hours he stayed there he was not questioned. He was taken into an office where the District Attorney showed him a statement made by a Miss Wright respecting the incest charge and asked him what he cared to say about it. He replied that he would not talk about it. He was questioned for about an hour. He says he was asked about his wife's death; others who were present deny this.\n He was held in the District Attorney's suite until 5 or 6 o'clock, was given supper at a cafe, and then conducted to the house next door to his home, where he arrived about 7 or 7:30. Various officers questioned him there in relays throughout the night concerning his wife's death. He sat in a chair fully dressed and had no sleep. Monday morning he was taken out for breakfast and went with the officers to point out to them a house at 9th and Alvarado Streets, after which he was taken to the District Attorney's offices. He was brought back to the house next door to his home and the questioning was resumed, and continued until about 3 o'clock Tuesday morning when, he says, he fainted, and others present say he fell asleep and slept until 7 or 8 o'clock. After he had breakfasted he was \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n booked at the jail, arraigned before a magistrate, and committed on the incest charge.\n James testified that about 10 P.M. Monday, April 20, the officers began to beat him; that his body was made black and blue; that the beating impaired his hearing, and caused a hernia; that later that night an Assistant District Attorney questioned him and that, after this ordeal, he collapsed. It is admitted that an officer slapped his face that night. This is said to have occurred as the result of an offensive remark James made concerning his wife; he denies having made the remark. In corroboration of James' testimony two witnesses said they noticed that one or both of his ears were bruised and swollen when he was lodged in the jail. All of this testimony is contradicted by numerous witnesses for the State, save only that it is admitted James was repeatedly and persistently questioned at intervals during the period from Sunday night until Tuesday morning. It is testified that, except for the one slap, no one laid a hand on James; that no inducement was held out to him; that no threats were made; that he answered questions freely and intelligently; and that he was at ease, cool, and collected. He admits that no promises or threats were made or maltreatment administered on the occasions when he was in the District Attorney's office. It is significant that James stated to one of the other officers that Officer Southard had slapped him and that when, May 2, the District Attorney asked how he had been treated he again referred to the slap. In neither case did he say anything of any other mistreatment. During the period April 19-21 James made no incriminating admission or confession.\n James says that shortly after his arrest on Sunday morning he asked, and was refused, permission to get into touch with Mr. Silverman, who had been his attorney for a number of years. This is denied. There is evidence that he saw Mr. Silverman on Monday, April 20, at the District \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 231]\n\u00a0\n Attorney's office. Mr. Silverman testified that he saw the petitioner immediately after his formal arrest; that he was with the petitioner at the arraignment on Tuesday, April 21st; and again on April 25th in the jail. It is not suggested that James was not allowed to see his attorney as often as he desired or that any obstacle was interposed to the attorney's interviewing him between April 21 and May 2.\n There is no claim that from April 21, when he was lodged in the jail, until May 2, he was interviewed, questioned, threatened, or mistreated by anyone. During this period his attorney told him that he would be indicted for his wife's murder and should not answer any questions unless his attorney was present.\n May 1, Hope was arrested and made a statement. On the morning of May 2, James was brought from his cell to the chaplain's room in the prison and confronted with Hope. An Assistant District Attorney outlined Hope's story and asked James whether he had anything to say, to which he replied: 'Nothing'.\n He went back to his cell and, about noon, an order of court was obtained to remove him from the prison. He was taken to his former home by two deputy sheriffs. The evidence does not disclose clearly either the purpose or the incidents of this trip. He was then brought to the District Attorney's office and that official began to question him. He requested that his attorney be sent for. In his presence a telephone call was made which disclosed that Mr. Silverman was not in Los Angeles. He asked that another attorney be summoned. He states that the District Attorney said it would take too long to acquaint any other attorney with the facts; others say that James did not give the name of the other attorney he wanted and it took some time to discover whom he had in mind. The attorney was not summoned.\n The District Attorney and, at times, others questioned James until supper time. Sandwiches and coffee were \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 232]\n\u00a0\n procured. James says he had coffee but someone took his sandwiches. There is testimony that he had them. The questioning, based on Hope's confession, was continued into the night without James having refused to answer questions or having made any incriminating answers.\n There is a sharp conflict as to how the session terminated. James says that Officer Southard, who had struck him on April 20, occupied the room alone with him, all others having left; that the officer told him he had been lying all evening and that if he did not tell the truth the officer would take him back to the house and beat him; that this so frightened him that he agreed to do his best to recite to the District Attorney the same story Hope had told. There is much evidence that no such incident occurred. Deputy Sheriff Killion says that sometime before midnight the others had left petitioner alone with him and that petitioner turned to him and said something to the effect: 'Why can't we go out and get something to eat; if we do I'll tell you the story.' To this Killion replied that they could go out. Killion and another Deputy Sheriff, Gray, a lady friend, and another person accompanied petitioner to a public cafe where they had a supper and afterwards had cigars. James testified that neither Killion nor Gray nor the District Attorney ever laid hand on him, threatened him or offered him any inducement to confess.\n The State's evidence is that after they started to smoke James told a story of which Killion took notes. Killion narrated at the trial what James had told him. The party returned to the District Attorney's office and there, responding to a question by the District Attorney, James said he had told Killion the story and, in answer to questions, he repeated that story. The interview was stenographically recorded. Most of the questions were asked by the District Attorney, some few by Killion and one or two \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 233]\n\u00a0\n other officers who were present. The group seems to have consisted of the District Attorney, an Assistant District Attorney, two officers, the two deputy sheriffs, and the stenographer.\n Hope's statement laid on James the initiation of the murder plot, the attempt to consummate it with snake poison, the drowning and the disposition of her body. The account James gave Killion and the District Attorney, which he now says was an attempt to retell the tale Hope had told, which had been constantly dinned into his ears, is by no means a reiteration of Hope's story. On the contrary, James insisted that Hope suggested the destruction of Mary James, and the rattlesnake expedient, which Hope carried out; that when this failed Hope suggested that he, Hope, burn down the house to make it appear that Mrs. James died by accident, and that Hope also volunteered to commit an abortion on Mrs. James and also to do away with her. James asserted that, while he was absent from his home on the morning of August 5, 1935, Hope drowned his wife in the bathtub and told James that he had done so.\n It is also to be noted that James' statement presents a lurid picture of the heavy drinking and intoxication of Hope, James, and Mary James during the three days anterior to the death of the latter. The effort evidently was to suggest that all were more or less irresponsible for their actions.\n If Hope's story is true, James planned and accomplished the murder of his wife to obtain the insurance on her life. If James' statement is true, Hope planned the murder, James desired to abandon the scheme and thought that all Hope ultimately intended to do was to commit an abortion on James' wife and was shocked and surprised to learn that Hope had murdered her.\n James said during supper at the cafe, and stated on another occasion, that there were not enough men in the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 234]\n\u00a0\n District Attorney's office to make him talk, and if Hope had not talked he would never have told the story.\n Scrutiny of the two statements indicates that James carefully considered what Hope had said and made up his mind to tell a story consistent with his intimacy with Hope, and with various incidents James could not deny, and then depict a drunken orgy as a result of which his will power was so enfeebled that he could not resist Hope's determination to make away with Mrs. James.\n At the trial James contradicted the essential particulars of Hope's testimony and most of his own confession, including the evidence respecting the snakes. He swore all Hope was to do was to attempt an abortion; he believed Hope did not accomplish this and his wife died as a result of falling into the pond in a fainting fit due to her pregnancy.\n The evidence as to the treatment of James and the conduct of officials and officers from the moment of his arrest until the close of his statement to the District Attorney was heard preliminarily by the trial judge in order to determine whether the State had, as required by California law, carried its burden of proving the confessions voluntary. The ruling was that it had and the confessions were admitted. The trial judge, at defendant's request, charged the jury, in accordance with the State law, that the confessions must be utterly disregarded unless they were voluntary, that is, not the result of inducements, promises, threats, violence, or any form of coercion.\n The failure of the arresting officers promptly to produce the petitioner before an examining magistrate, their detention of him in their custody from Sunday morning to Tuesday morning, and any assault committed upon him, were violations of state statutes10 and criminal offenses. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 235]\n\u00a0\n We find no authority for the issue of the court order under which the sheriff's deputies took the accused from jail to his former home, and to the District Attorney's office for questioning. \n12\n The denial of opportunity to consult counsel, requested on May 2nd, was a misdemeanor. \n13\n It may be assumed this treatment of the petitioner also deprived him of his liberty without due process and that the petitioner would have been afforded preventive relief if he could have gained access to a court to seek it.\n But illegal acts, as such, committed in the course of obtaining a confession, whatever their effect on its admissibility under local law, do not furnish an answer to the constitutional question we must decide. The effect of the officers' conduct must be appraised by other considerations in determining whether the use of the confessions was a denial of due process. Moreover, petitioner does not, and cannot, ask redress in this proceeding for any disregard of due process prior to his trial. The gravamen of his complaint is the unfairness of the use of his confessions, and what occurred in their procurement is relevant only as it bears on that issue. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 236]\n\u00a0\n On the other hand, the fact that the confessions have been conclusively adjudged by the decision below to be admissible under State law, notwithstanding the circumstances under which they were made, does not answer the question whether due process was lacking. The aim of the rule that a confession is inadmissible unless it was voluntarily made is to exclude false evidence. Tests are invoked to determine whether the inducement to speak was such that there is a fair risk the confession is false. \n14\n These vary in the several states. \n15\n This Court has formulated those which are to govern in trials in the federal courts. \n16\n The Fourteenth Amendment leaves California free to adopt, by statute or decision, and to enforce such rule as she elects, whether it conform to that applied in the federal or in other state courts. But the adoption of the rule of her choice cannot foreclose inquiry as to whether, in a given case, the application of that rule works a deprivation of the prisoner's life or liberty without due process of law. The aim of the requirement of due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence whether true or false. The criteria for decision of that question may differ from those appertaining to the State's rule as to the admissibility of a confession.\n As applied to a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice. In order to declare a denial of it we must find that the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial. Such unfairness exists when a coerced confession is used as a means \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 237]\n\u00a0\n of obtaining a verdict of guilt. We have so held in every instance in which we have set aside for want of due process a conviction based on a confession.\n To extort testimony from a defendant by physical torture in the very presence of the trial tribunal is not due process. The case stands no better if torture induces an extrajudicial confession which is used as evidence in the courtroom. \n 17\n\u00a0\n\n A trial dominated by mob violence in the courtroom is not such as due process demands. \n18\n The case can stand no better if mob violence anterior to the trial is the inducing cause of the defendant's alleged confession.\n If, by fraud, collusion, trickery and subornation of perjury on the part of those representing the state, the trial of an accused person results in his conviction he has been denied due process of law. \n19\n The case can stand no better if, by the same devices, a confession is procured and used in the trial.\n The concept of due process would void a trial in which, by threats or promises in the presence of court and jury, a defendant was induced to testify against himself. The case can stand no better if, by resort to the same means, the defendant is induced to confess and his confession is given in evidence. As we have said, 'due process of law ... commands that no such practice ... shall send any accused to his death.' \n20\n\u00a0\n\n Where the claim is that the prisoner's statement has been procured by such means we are bound to make an independent examination of the record to determine the validity of the claim. The performance of this duty cannot be foreclosed by the finding of a court, or the verdict \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 238]\n\u00a0\n of a jury, or both. \n21\n If the evidence bearing upon the question is uncontradicted, the application of the constitutional provision is unembarrassed by a finding or a verdict in a state court; even though, in ruling that the confession was admissible, the very tests were applied in the state court to which we resort to answer the constitutional question. \n 22\n\u00a0\n\n There are cases, such as this one, where the evidence as to the methods employed to obtain a confession is conflicting, and in which, although denial of due process was not an issue in the trial, an issue has been resolved by court and jury which involves an answer to the due process question. In such a case we accept the determination of the triers of fact, unless it is so lacking in support in the evidence that to give it effect would work that fundamental unfairness which is at war with due process.\n Here judge and jury passed on the question whether the petitioner's confessions were freely and voluntarily made, and the tests applied in answering that question rendered the decision one that also answered the question whether the use of the confessions involved a denial of due process; this notwithstanding the issue submitted was not eo nomine one concerning due process. Furthermore, in passing on the petitioner's claim, the Supreme Court of the State found no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our duty then is to determine whether the evidence requires that we set aside the finding of two courts and a jury and adjudge the admission of the confessions so fundamentally unfair, so contrary to the common concept of ordered liberty as to amount to a taking of life without due process of law. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 239]\n\u00a0\n In view of the conflicting testimony, we are unable to say that the finding below was erroneous so far as concerns the petitioner's claims of physical violence, threats or implied promises of leniency. There remains the uncontradicted fact that on two occasions, separated by an interval of eleven days, the petitioner was questioned for protracted periods. He made no admission implicating him in his wife's death during, or soon after, the interrogations of April 19, 20, and 21. If, without more, eleven days later confessions had been forthcoming we should have no hesitation in overruling his contention respecting the admission of his confessions.\n Does the questioning on May 2nd, in and of itself, or in the light of his earlier experience, render the use of the confessions a violation of due process? If we are so to hold it must be upon the ground that such a practice, irrespective of the result upon the petitioner, so tainted his statements that, without considering other facts disclosed by the evidence, and without giving weight to accredited findings below that his statements were free and voluntary, as a matter of law, they were inadmissible in his trial. This would be to impose upon the state courts a stricter rule than we have enforced in federal trials. \n23\n There is less reason for such a holding when we reflect that we are dealing with the system of criminal administration of California, a quasi-sovereign; that if federal power is invoked to set aside what California regards as a fair trial it must be plain that a federal right has been invaded.\n We have not hesitated to set aside convictions based in whole, or in substantial part, upon confessions extorted in graver circumstances. These were secured by protracted and repeated questioning of ignorant and untutored persons in whose minds the power of officers \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 240]\n\u00a0\n was greatly magnified; who sensed the adverse sentiment of the community and the danger of mob violence; who had been held incommunicado, without the advice of friends or of counsel; some of whom had been taken by officers at night from the prison into dark and lonely places for questioning. \n24\n This case is outside the scope of those decisions.\n Like the Supreme Court of California, we disapprove the violations of law involved in the treatment of the petitioner, and we think it right to add that where a prisoner held incommunicado is subjected to questioning by officers for long periods, and deprived of the advice of counsel, we shall scrutinize the record with care to determine whether, by the use of his confession, he is deprived of liberty or life through tyrannical or oppressive means. Officers of the law must realize that if they indulge in such practices they may, in the end, defeat rather than further the ends of justice. Their lawless practices here took them close to the line. But on the facts as we have endeavored fairly to set them forth, and in the light of the findings in the State courts, we cannot hold that the illegal conduct in which the law enforcement officers of California indulged by the prolonged questioning of the prisoner before arraignment, and in the absence of counsel, or their questioning on May 2, coerced the confessions, the introduction of which is the infringement of due process of which the petitioner complains. The petitioner has said that the interrogation would never have drawn an admission from him had his confederate not made a statement; he admits that no threats, promises, or acts of physical violence were offered him during this questioning or for eleven days preceding it. Counsel had been afforded full opportunity to see him and had advised him. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 241]\n\u00a0\n He exhibited a self-possession, a coolness, and an acumen throughout his questioning, and at his trial, which negatives the view that he had so lost his freedom of action that the statements made were not his but were the result of the deprivation of his free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.\n The judgments are affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs.\n I believe the confession used to convict James was the result of coercion and compulsion, and that the judgment should be reversed for that reason. The testimony of the officers to whom the confession was given is enough, sanding alone, to convince me that it could not have been free and voluntary. Cf. Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532\n, 18 S.Ct. 183. In brief, those officers admitted the following:\n Suspecting the defendant of murder they entered his home on Sunday, April 19, 1936, at 9 a.m. He was taken to a furnished house next door, in which the State's Attorney's office had installed a dictaphone. For the next forty-eight hours, or a little longer, the State's Attorney, his assistants, and investigators held James as their prisoner. He was so held not under indictment or warrant of arrest but by force. At about 4 a.m. Monday, one Southard, an investigator, 'slapped' the defendant whose left ear was thereafter red and swollen. James was apparently kept at the State's Attorney's office during the daylight hours; the full extent to which he was questioned there is not clear. But on Monday and Tuesday nights, at the furnished house, with no one present but James and the officers, he was subjected to constant interrogation. The questioning officers divided themselves into squads, so that some could sleep while the others continued the question- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 242]\n\u00a0\n ing. The defendant got no sleep during the first forty-two hours after the officers seized him. And about 3:30 or 4 a.m. Tuesday morning, while sitting in the chair he occupied while being interrogated, at the very moment a question was being asked him, the defendant fell asleep. There he remained asleep until about 7 or 8 a.m. At about 11 a.m. the officers took him to jail and booked him on a charge of incest. During the entire forty- two hours defendant was held, he repeatedly denied any complicity in or knowledge of the murder of his wife.\n The second episode during which the officers held defendant incommunicado, and which produced the confession, was on May 2 and in the early hours of May 3. About 11 a.m. on May 2 an investigator for the District Attorney took James from his cell to the chaplain's room of the jail. In the presence of an Assistant District Attorney he was confronted by Hope and told that Hope had made a confession implicating James in his wife's murder. James refused to talk and was then carried back to his cell. A short time later, under a purported order of court, the nature or authority of which does not appear, James was taken from the jail to his home, and then somewhere between 1 and 4 p.m. to the District Attorney's office. The doors were locked. From then until about midnight the District Attorney, his Assistants, and investigators, subjected James to constant interrogation. Upon asking for his attorney, James was told he was out of the city. He then asked for another but whatever efforts the officers made to satisfy this request were unsuccessful. He was again confronted with Hope but neither this nor the questioning had elicited an admission of any nature by midnight. At that time, according to the investigators, James said to one of them, 'Can't we go out and get something to eat-if you fellows will take me out to eat now, I will \n\n[314 \nU.S. 219, 243]\n\u00a0\n tell you the story.' 1 He was taken out to eat by some of the officers, remained about an hour and a half, while at the restaurant made damaging admissions, and upon his return to the District Attorney's office, made the full statement which was used to bring about his conviction, completing it at about 3 a.m. Southard, the investigator who had previously 'slapped' him, was one of the signed witnesses of the confession. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n I think the facts set out are sufficient to make applicable the principles announced in Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472, 479, and the conclusion there announced that: 'Due process of law, preserved for all by our Constitution, commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this record shall send any accused to his death.'

Section 4004 of the 1941 Code ( 1600 of the 1935 Code) requires a prisoner committed by a magistrate to be confined in a jail until legally discharged, and declares that if he is permitted to go at large out of the jail, except by virtue of a legal order or process, this shall constitute an escape. The only statutes we are able to find authorizing an order for the removal of a prisoner from jail are  4011 and 4012 of the Penal Code, 1941, ( 1607 and 1608 of the 1935 Code) which provide for cases of individual illness or a general outbreak of pestilence or disease in a prison.

In response to an inquiry whether he was told his confession might be used against him, James replied: 'I didn't know whether the statement would be used against me, or not. I would rather die than to have gone back to that house and went through torture like the three days I was out there. I didn't care whether the statement was taken, or not.' \n\n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAASS v.

The complaint alleged that the decedent died August 30, 1936; that in the estate's return the executors elected to have the value of the gross \n\n[312 \nU.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n estate determined by valuing it as of one year after the decedent's death; that the Commissioner included in the estate a sum which was not in fact the decedent's property at the time of her death but represented income, namely, rents, dividends, and interest earned by the estate subsequent to the decedent's death; that the executors paid the tax and their claim for refund was rejected. The Collector's answer raised no material issue of fact. Each party moved for judgment on the pleadings. The court dismissed the complaint. 2 The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed one judge dissenting. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In Nos. 510 and 511, the executor of two decedents who died respectively October 9, 1936, and April 3, 1937, elected in its returns to have the gross estates valued as of one year after death or as of date of disposition. In each case the executor collected interest and dividends upon bonds and stocks forming part of the estate at decedent's death. The sums so collected were not reckoned in fixing the values of the estates, except such portion of them as accrued prior to death. The Commissioner determined deficiencies due to the failure to return them. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed his action4 and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's decision. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Although there was no conflict between decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeals, 6 we granted certiorari because of the importance of the question and the number of pending cases in which it is presented. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 443, 446]\n\u00a0\n It is agreed that the purpose of subdivision (j) was to mitigate the hardship consequent upon shrinkage in the value of estates during the year following death. Congress enacted it in the light of the fact that, due to such shrinkages, many estates were almost obliterated by the necessity of paying a tax on the value of the assets at the date of decedent's death. About one year after the adoption of the subsection, the Treasury promulgated Art. 11 of Regulations 80 (1937 Ed.) in which it ruled that interest bearing obligations, such as bonds, embodied two promises, one to pay principal, the other to pay interest, both a part of the gross estate if the obligation was owned by the decedent at his death. It further ruled that in the case of leased real estate two factors were to be considered, the value of the realty and the value of the covenant to pay rent. With respect to stocks, it ruled that the value of the stock and the value of the right to dividends thereon were separable and each constituted an element of value to the decedent. The regulation required that if, during the year subsequent to death, rents, royalties, interest, or dividends were received by the decedent's estate, such portion thereof as had not accrued, or was not attributable to a period prior to death, should be returned in full and reckoned as part of the gross estate in any case where the executor elected, as permitted by subsection (j), to value the assets as of one year after the decedent's death or as of the date of disposition of any asset. In accordance with the regulation the deficiencies in the present cases were determined.\n In the courts below, and before the Board of Tax Appeals, the Government contended that such items of income are in truth payments on account of principal and that, by such payments, the principal is reduced so that, when the capital asset is valued at the end of the period, its true value is not reflected unless there be \n\n[312 \nU.S. 443, 447]\n\u00a0\n added the interest, dividend, or other like payment received by the estate in the interim. In this court, the argument takes a somewhat different form. Reference is made to the fact that, under the option granted, a capital asset is to be valued either at the expiration of the year or at the time of disposition and it is urged that, as respects interest, rent or dividends, a disposition occurs at the date of the receipt of the item. In either aspect the validity of the contention depends upon the theory that, for purposes of estate tax valuation, the asset consists of two elements,-one the right of ownership the other the right to receive the income. It is said that both of these elements enter into the valuation made as of the date of death and if, in the subsequent period, the latter emerges in the shape of a payment that payment is to be attributable to the income right rather than to the right of ownership of the income producing property.\n On the other hand, the petitioners insist that the Government's position is unreal and artificial; that it does not comport either with economic theory or business practice; and that the regulation is an unwarranted extension of the plain meaning of the statute and cannot, therefore, be sustained. We hold that the petitioners are right.\n It is not denied that, in common understanding, rents, interest, and dividends are income. Under the revenue acts, if such items are collected by a decedent's estate, the executors are bound to return them and pay tax upon them as income. In the case of a living holder, such receipts are never treated as on account of principal. Nor does the promise to pay interest, rents or dividends either to a living owner of the asset or to his executor after death, which has not been legally separated from the asset of which it is an incident, have any mar- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 443, 448]\n\u00a0\n ket value apart from the asset, or bear any invariable relation to the value of the capital asset.\n It is true that a bond embodies two promises, one to pay the principal at maturity, the other to pay interest at intervals until maturity. And the promise to pay interest or rent, or the expectancy of dividends upon stock, the amount of such payments, the past and prospective regularity of the payments, and other elements bearing upon the expectation of the receipt of income affect the value of any income producing property. But these elements are not separately valued in appraising the worth of the asset at any given time. It is the uniform practice to value the asset as an entirety, taking into consideration all the elements that go to give it value in the market.\n In the appraisal of a decedent's estate, rent or interest accrued to the date of death is properly treated as a capital asset. So also, on the sale of an interest bearing security, it is the uniform practice to add to the value of the obligation, as such, accrued interest to the date of sale. Since the statute says that, at the option of the executor, a bond may be valued as of one year subsequent to the decedent's death, the natural conclusion is that the usual method of valuation shall be pursued whichever date is selected. The method always adopted for valuation at death is the same used in fixing a sale price; that is, to take the market value of the bond and add accrued interest to the date of transfer, at the rate stipulated in the instrument. It is not believed that Congress, in providing for two dates of valuation, intended that a different method should be followed if one date were chosen rather than the other.\n If Congress intended the result for which the Government contends, namely, that a different method of valuation should apply at the end of the one year period than that applicable as of the date of death, it would have \n\n[312 \nU.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n been a simple matter so to state. That Congress had no such intention seems clear from the report of the House Managers on the conference committee report on the bill which embodied the language in question. \n7\n There an example is given as to how the calculation of value should be made at the end of the year. In this example appreciation and depreciation in the value of bonds, stocks, and other assets, during the year, are shown but dividends or interest received are not included.\n As has been said, the view we take comports with standard business practice; whereas the theory advocated by the Government involves the attribution to interest payments of a quality derived from a refined separation of so-called rights inherent in the ownership of income producing property. Conceding that the ownership of a bond involves both the right to receive principal and the right to receive income, it is a highly artificial concept that an interest payment is a disposition, pro tanto, of the latter right by the owner of the obligation. Moreover, while the Constitution does not forbid double taxation, the intent to impose it upon a given receipt is not presumed. We think that, if it had been intended, Congress unequivocally would have so declared.\n Judgments reversed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS are of the view that this question of statutory construction is peculiarly appropriate for administrative interpretation (See Paul, Studies in Federal Taxation, 3d series, pp. 423-425) and accordingly that the judgments in these cases should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the court below in No. 274, Saks v. Higgins, 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 78. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The subsection has now been embodied in the Internal Revenue Code as  811(j), 53 Stat. 122, 26 U.S.C.A.

Francis E. Baldwin and Albert H. Veeder, both of Chicago, Ill ., for petitioners.\n Helen R. Carloss, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The taxpayer's1 share of a testamentary trust, established pursuant to the will of her father, was delivered to her in kind in 1923. The property was personalty, part of which had been owned by the decedent and part purchased by the trustees. The decedent died in 1903 and his executors were discharged by the probate court in 1905. Pursuant to that order the executors turned over to themselves, as trustees, all of the residue of the estate. \n2\n From that residue the taxpayer's claim to the property in question derived. During the year 1930 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n parts of both groups of property were sold. \n3\n The questions presented relate to the proper basis under the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, for determining gain or loss upon those sales: (1) whether the basis in case of the personalty owned by decedent is its value when received by the trustees from the executors or its value at the date of delivery by the trustees to the taxpayer; and (2) whether the basis in case of the personalty purchased by the trustees is its cost to the trustees or its value at the date of delivery by the trustees to the taxpayer. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted because of a conflict among the circuits on those two questions. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n I. As respects the property owned by the decedent at his death, we are of the view that the date when it was received by the trustees from the executors, rather than the date when it was delivered by the trustees to the taxpayer, governs. In the case of general bequests,  113(a)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 380, provided that 'the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer.' \n5\n But \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n in case of specific bequests of personalty or in case of realty, the basis was the fair market value of the property at the death of the decedent. Sec. 113(a)(5). In the latter cases the property either vested in the heir or devisee at death or was rather definitely marked at the time of death for the legatee. In the former the legatee normally must have awaited administration of the estate before the property bequeathed to him could have been identified with certainty. That difference suggests the distinction in treatment under  113(a)(5) of general bequests of personalty. It emphasizes that the words 'at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer' meant the time when the distribution was made out of the estate. It supports the view that Congress focused \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n s 113(a)(5) on the decedent's death and the administration of his estate, and not on subsequent transfers or transmissions of the property.\n The legislative history of  113(a)(5) lends support to that conclusion. Prior to the 1928 Act the basis for property obtained by bequest, devise, or inheritance was the fair market value 'at the time of such acquisition'.6 The House Bill7 which became the Revenue Act of 1928 provided that the basis for all property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance should be the fair market value of the property at the date of the decedent's death-a provision designed to clarify8 the meaning of 'acquisition' in the earlier acts. \n9\n In the Senate that \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n language of  113(a)(5) was changed to the form in which it appeared in the Revenue Act of 1928-a change specifically designed to avoid the confusion as to the basis on which gain or loss on the sale of property purchased by the executor and distributed to beneficiaries was to be determined. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n There does not appear to be the slightest suggestion that this change was designed as a substantial departure from the value-at-death rule. To be sure, it did produce a limited deviation from that principle in that no income tax effect was to be given changes in value of personal property, passing otherwise than by specific bequest, during the administration of the estate. But to hold that it effected the change which petitioner urges would be to impute to Congress a purpose to go far beyond the exigencies of the specific situations with which it was dealing.\n The language used does not require that result. 'Distribution to the taxpayer' is not necessarily restricted to situations where property is delivered to the taxpayer. It also aptly describes the case where property is delivered by the executors to trustees in trust for the taxpayer. Such distribution of the estate results in the acquisition by the taxpayer of an equitable estate under the testamentary trust. The fact that he does not then obtain possession or control, the fact that his interest is conditional or contingent, the fact that legal title may not be transferred to him until years later, are immaterial. Sec. 113(a)(5) merely provided a point of reference and a standard of value for determination of gains or losses realized on subsequent sales of property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance. In Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 334\n, 50 S.Ct. 115, 116, this Court held under earlier acts11 that the date of death was the date of 'acquisition' even in case of a residuary legatee whose interest at the date of death clearly was not absolute. That conclusion suggests that the critical date is the time when the legatee acquires some interest in the property although his interest then may not be unconditional. Hence, in case of remainders governed by  113(a)(5) of the 1928 Act, it \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n cannot realistically be asserted that the date when the remainderman acquired his interest came later than the time when he obtained an equitable estate under the testamentary trust.\n There are other reasons why we cannot infer that Congress intended to make more than a limited departure from the value-at-death principle in enacting  113(a)(5) of the 1928 Act. As respondent points out, there would be a substantial disparity between the treatment of remaindermen of realty and remaindermen of personalty under the same testamentary trust, if the latter were given a basis of value at the time of distribution by the trust. Furthermore, we cannot on the basis of the legislative history of  113(a)(5) impute to Congress a purpose to allow trustees either to sell the property or to distribute it in kind, as would be most advantageous for tax purposes. The creation of such an opportunity for manipulation of tax liability cannot be lightly presumed. Similarly we cannot assume in absence of explicit provisions that Congress intended to create substantial periods of time following the date of death during which the value of the property bequeathed would have no incidence as respects subsequent gains or losses. Respect for the obvious symmetry of this statutory scheme induces the conclusion that there was a 'distribution to the taxpayer' when this property was delivered by the executors to the trustees. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n II. As respects the property which was purchased by the trustees, we are of the view that its cost to them, rather than its value at the date of delivery to the tax- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n payer, governs. Sec. 113(a) provided that the basis in case of property acquired after February 28, 1913, should be 'the cost of such property'.13 That standard controls here unless these transactions are governed by the provision of  113(a)(5) that, 'In all other cases if the property was acquired either by will or by intestacy, the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer.' The latter provision is applicable if the property in question was 'acquired ... by will'. We think it was not.\n The title of  113(a)(5) is 'Property transmitted at death.' While the title of an act will not limit the plain meaning of the text ( Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 490\n, 37 S.Ct. 192, 196, L.R.A.1917F, 502, Ann.Cas.1917B, 1168; Strathearn S.S. Co. v. Dillon, \n252 \nU.S. 348, 354\n, 40 S.Ct. 350, 351), it may be of aid in resolving an ambiguity. Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 65\n, 20 S.Ct. 747, 756. It suggests, as does the legislative history which we have related, that the foregoing provision of  113(a)(5) was confined, with minor exceptions, to the specific property owned by the decedent at his death. To be sure, the taxpayer's right in the property in question had its source in the provisions of the will. But there is no indication that Congress in drafting  113(a)(5) looked beyond the distribution of the estate by the executors. In that connection, the Senate Report specifically stated that the foregoing provision of  113(a)(5) governed purchases by the executors. \n14\n No reference was made to purchases by testamentary trustees. The inference is strong that Congress was fashioning  113(a)(5) on the theory that for income tax purposes acquisition of personal property passing by general bequest or intestacy did not occur until distribution of the estate was made. In that pos- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n ture of the problem, property purchased by the executor (acting, so to speak, in the decedent's stead) prior to that distribution was acquired by the distributee 'by will'. But once the administration of the estate had been completed and the basic testamentary disposition effected, subsequent purchases were to be governed by cost as provided in  113(a). Property so purchased would not be part of the original inheritance. Certainly if the trustees themselves had sold the property, the transaction would have been taxable on the cost basis. To hold that a different basis applies in case the beneficiary made the sale would be to open an avenue for tax avoidance. Furthermore, we are dealing here with a statutory scheme which in general recognizes value at the date of death in computing subsequent gains or losses. We are not inclined in absence of clear and unambiguous language to imply a greater deviation from that principle than that which is necessitated by the declared objective of Congress.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Commissioner v. Gambrill, 112 F.2d 530. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioners are husband and wife who filed a joint return. The income here involved is that of the wife. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The will directed the executors and trustees, not less than ten and not more than twenty years after the death of the testator, to make final distribution of this residue as follows: '... to my wife the one-third part thereof, the balance to be equally divided among my children, share and share alike, and should my wife not be living at the time of such distribution, then the same shall be divided equally among my children, share and share alike, the descendants of any deceased children in such distribution to take the proportion of their deceased parent, ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The sales were made by trustees of new inter vivos trusts under which the property had been placed on its delivery in 1923. It was stipulated that the beneficiaries (including the taxpayer) were taxable as though the sales were made by them individually. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The opinion of the court below is reported at 7 Cir., 111 F.2d 843. On the first question it held that the basis was the value at the time the property was received by the trustees from the executors; on the second, that the basis was cost to the trustees. On those two questions that decision is in conflict with Commissioner v. Gambrill, 112 F.2d 530, from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. And see Commissioner v. Libbey, 1 Cir ., 100 F.2d 458. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Sec. 113(a)(5) provided: '(a) Property Acquired After February 28, 1913. The basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property acquired after February 28, 1913, shall be the cost of such property; except that ... (5) Property transmitted at death. If personal property was acquired by specific bequest, or if real property was acquired by general or specific devise or by intestacy, the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the death of the decedent. If the property was acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent, the basis in the hands of the estate shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the death of the decedent. In all other cases if the property was acquired either by will or by intestacy, the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer. In the case of property transferred in trust to pay the income for life to or upon the order or direction of the grantor, with the right reserved to the grantor at all times prior to his death to revoke the trust, the basis of such property in the hands of the persons entitled under the terms of the trust instrument to the property after the grantor's death shall, after such death, be the same as if the trust instrument had been a will executed on the day of the grantor's death.'\n Sec. 113(b) provided: '(b) Property Acquired before March 1, 1913. The basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property acquired before March 1, 1913 shall be: (1) the cost of such property (or, in the case of such property as is described in subsection (a) ... (5) ... of this section, the basis as therein provided), or (2) the fair market value of such property as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227,  202(a); Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253,  204(a), 26 U.S.C.A.

Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327\n, 50 S.Ct. 115, holding that in case of a residuary legatee of personal property the time of 'acquisition' was the date of decedent's death, not the date of distribution of the property by the executors to the legatee. That decision was rendered in 1930 under the 1918 and 1921 Acts. The wording of  113(a)(5) contained in the 1928 Act was continued in the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 169, 199, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 515. But under the 1934 Act, 48 Stat. 680, 706, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 697, there was a return to the language of the 1926 Act, the Senate Report stating: 'Section 113(a)5 of the Revenue Act of 1932 is a reenactment of a similar provision contained in the 1928 Act. The change in the 1928 Act was made because there was some doubt as to the meaning of the term 'date of acquisition,' which was the term used under the Revenue Act of 1926. Since the 1928 Act was passed, the Supreme Court has defined 'the date of acquisition' to mean the date of death in the case of all property passing by bequest, devise, and inheritance, whether real or personal. Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327\n, 50 S.Ct. 115. Section 113(a)5 of the House bill conforms to the language contained in the Revenue Act of 1926, so that a uniform basis rule may be required in the case of property passing at death, whether real or personal.'

No. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., Int.Rev.Bull., supra note 8, p. 409, where it was said (p. 427): 'It appears that the House bill is inadequate to take care of a number of situations which frequently arise. For example, the executor, pursuant to the terms of the will, may purchase property and distribute it to the beneficiaries, in which case it is impossible to use the value at the decedent's death as the basis for determining subsequent gain or loss, for the decedent never owned the property. Moreover, the fair market value of the property at the decedent's death can not properly be used as the basis, in the case of property transferred in contemplation of death where the donee sells the property while the donor is living.\n'Accordingly, the committee has revised section 113(a)5 and certain related sections, so as to provide that in the case of a specific bequest of personalty or a general or specific devise of realty, or the transmission of realty by intestacy, the basis shall be the fair market value at the time of the death of the decedent. In these cases it may be said, as a matter of substance, that the property for all practical purposes vests in the beneficiary immediately upon the decedent's death, and therefore the value at the date of death is a proper basis for the determination of gain or loss to the beneficiary. The same rule is applied to real and personal property transmitted by the decedent, where the sale is made by the executor. In all other cases the basis is the fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer. The latter rule would obtain, for example, in the case of personal property not transmitted to the beneficiary by specific bequest, but by general bequest or by intestacy. It would also apply in cases where the executor purchases property and distributes it to the beneficiary.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See note 9, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] We are not aided by administrative construction.

Dalton, both of Omaha, Neb ., assisting Wm. J. Hotz on brief, for appellants.\n Messrs. Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N.J., and Louis D. Frohlich and Herman Finkelstein, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Most of the questions presented by this case are the same as those that were raised in Watson v. Buck, \n313 \nU.S. 387\n, 61 S.Ct. 962, 85 L.Ed . --, this day decided. Here, as there, at the request of ASCAP and its co- complainants a federal District Court composed of three judges enjoined various state officials from enforcing a state statute1 aimed primarily at price-fixing com- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 406, 407]\n\u00a0\n binations operating in the field of public performance of copyright music. 2 Here, as there, the complainants alleged, and the defendants denied, that enforcement of the act had been threatened. Here, as there, the court below found that threats had been made, that some of the sections of the act were invalid, that the invalidity of those sections permeated the whole, and that the state officials should be enjoined from enforcing any of the numerous provisions of the Act. But, as in the Florida case, the court below proceeded on a mistaken premise as to the role a federal equity court should play in enjoining state criminal statutes. Here, there was no more of a showing of exceptional circumstances, specific threats, and irreparable injury than in the Florida case. In his brief in this Court, the Attorney General of Nebraska stated that 'Appellants, as law enforcement officers, sincerely hope that no action under this law will be required. None was threatened before nor since the suit was started.' With one possible exception, the record bears out the statement of the Attorney General; there was no evidence whatever that any threats had been made, but in his answer the Attorney General stated that he would 'enforce the act against the complainant Society ... (if) the complainant Society would operate in the State of Nebraska in violation of the terms of the statute by conniving and conspiring to fix and determine prices for public performance of copyrighted musical compositions ....' As we have just held in Watson v. Buck, it was error to issue an injunction under these circumstances.\n In other material respects also, this case is like the Florida case. The court below failed to pass on what we consider the heart of the statute because of what it regarded as the pervading vice of the invalid sections. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 406, 408]\n\u00a0\n But section 12 of the Nebraska statute is similar to section 12 of the Florida statute and provides that 'If any Section, subdivision, sentence or clause in this Act shall, for any reason, be held void or non- enforceable, such decision shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other part or parts of this Act.' The legislative will is respected by the Supreme Court of Nebraska,3 and the court below should have followed state law in this regard. That part of the statute on which the court did not pass-and the part which the Attorney General said he stood willing to enforce if violated-set up a complete scheme for the regulation of combinations controlling performing rights in copyright music. On the authority of Watson v. Buck, the decision below is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to dismiss the bill.\n Reversed and remanded with instructions.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Neb.Laws 1937, ch. 138. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 33 F.Supp. 377. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Petersen v.

PACIFIC COAL & OIL CO.(1941)\nNo. 194\nArgued: January 9, 1941Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Parker Fulton and Paca Oberlin, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n No appearance for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner issued a conventional liability policy to the insured, the Pacific Coal & Oil Co., in which it agreed to indemnify the insured for any sums the latter might be required to pay to third parties for injuries to person and property caused by automobiles hired by the insured. Petitioner also agreed that it would defend any action covered by the policy which was brought against the insured to recover damages for such injuries.\n While the policy was in force, a collision occurred between an automobile driven by respondent Orteca and a truck driven by an employee of the insured. Orteca brought an action in an Ohio state court against the insured to recover damages resulting from injuries sustained in this collision. Apparently this action has not proceeded to judgment.\n Petitioner then brought this action against the insured and Orteca. Its complaint set forth the facts detailed above and further alleged that at the time of the collision the employee of the insured was driving a truck sold to him by the insured on a conditional sales contract. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner claimed that this truck was not one 'hired by the insured,' and hence that it was not liable to defend the action by orteca against the insured or to indemnify the latter if Orteca prevailed. It sought a declaratory judgment to this effect against the insured and Orteca, and a temporary injunction restraining the proceedings in the state court pending final judgment in this suit.\n Orteca demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state a cause of action against him. The District Court sustained his demurrer and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 6 Cir., 111 F.2d 214. We granted certiorari on October 14, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 625\n, 61 S.Ct. 25, 85 L.Ed. --, to resolve the conflict with the decisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeals cited in the note. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The question is whether petitioner's allegations are sufficient to entitle it to the declaratory relief prayed in its complaint. This raises the question whether there is an 'actual controversy' within the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act, Judicial Code  274d, 28 U.S.C.  400, 28 U.S.C.A.  400, since the District Court is without power to grant declaratory relief unless such a controversy exists. Nashville, etc., Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 259\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 346, 87 A.L. R. 1191; U.S.C.A. Constitution, Art. III,  2. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n The difference between an abstract question and a 'controversy' contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree, and it would be difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy. Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. See Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, \n300 \nU.S. 227\n, 239-242, 57 S.Ct. 461, 463, 464, 108 A.L.R. 1000. It is immaterial that frequently, in the declaratory judgment suit, the positions of the parties in the conventional suit are reversed; the inquiry is the same in either case. Nashville, etc., Ry. Co. v. Wallace, supra, 288 U.S. page 261, 53 S.Ct. page 347, 87 A.L.R. 1191\n\n\n That the complaint in the instant case presents such a controversy is plain. Orteca is now seeking a judgment against the insured in an action which the latter claims is covered by the policy, and sections 9510-3 and 9510-4 of the Ohio Code (Page's Ohio General Code, Vol. 6,  9510-3, 9510- 4) give Orteca a statutory right to proceed against petitioner by supplemental process and action if he obtains a final judgment against the insured which the latter does not satisfy within thirty days after its rendition. Compare Maryland Casualty Co. v. United Corporation, 1 Cir., 111 F.2d 443, 446; Central Surety & Insurance Corp. v. Norris, 5 Cir., 103 F.2d 116, 117; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Pierson, 8 Cir., 97 F.2d 560, 562. Moreover, Orteca may perform the conditions of the policy issued to the insured requiring notice of the accident, notice of suit, etc., in order to prevent lapse of the policy through failure of the insured to perform such conditions. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Randall, 125 Ohio St. 581, 183 N.E. 433; see, also, Lind v. State Automobile Mutual Insurance Association, 128 Ohio St. 1, 190 N.E. 138; \n\n[312 \nU.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n State Automobile Mutual Insurance Association v. Friedman, 122 Ohio St. 334, 171 N.E. 591.\n It is clear that there is an actual controversy between petitioner and the insured. Compare Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, supra. If we held contrariwise as to Orteca because, as to him, the controversy were yet too remote, it is possible that opposite interpretations of the policy might be announced by the federal and state courts. For the federal court, in a judgment not binding on Orteca, might determine that petitioner was not obligated under the policy, while the state court, in a supplemental proceeding by Orteca against petitioner, might conclude otherwise. Compare Central Surety & Insurance Corp. v. Norris, supra, 103 F.2d page 117; Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Yeatts, 4 Cir., 99 F.2d 665, 670.\n Thus we hold that there is an actual controversy between petitioner and Orteca, and hence, that petitioner's complaint states a cause of action against the latter. However, our decision does not authorize issuance of the injunction prayed by petitioner. Judicial Code  265, 28 U. S.C.  379, 28 U.S.C.A.  379; see Central Surety & Insurance Corp. v. Norris, supra, 103 F.2d page 117; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Consumers Finance Service, Inc., 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 514, 516; Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Yeatts, supra, 99 F.2d page 670.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice BLACK did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Maryland Casualty Co. v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1941)\nNo. 55\nArgued: December 12, 1940Decided: January 6, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward D. Smith, Jr., and M. E. Kilpatrick, both of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Helen R. Carloss, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. T. F. Davies Haines, of New York City, for respondent Thomson.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question whether upon the surrender of bonds or debentures in exchange for a money payment less than cost, a taxpayer may deduct the loss from his gross income as a bad debt under  23(k)1 or must treat it as a capital loss under  117(f)2 of the Revenue Act of 1934\n\n\n In number 55 it appears that the taxpayer owned $15,000 par value of bonds of a water district, acquired by gift. The district being in financial difficulties offered to pay $7,476.75 for them. The offer was accepted and the bonds delivered. In his tax return the taxpayer claimed a deduction of $7,523.25 as for a bad debt charged off. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction, and the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals3 sustained his ruling.\n In number 58 the facts are that the taxpayer bought $25,000 par value of debentures for $24,750. The issuer's affairs were placed in the hands of a receiver. A plan of reorganization provided that the receiver should pay $5 for each $1,000 debenture surrendered for cancellation. The taxpayer availed himself of this privision, and in his tax return claimed a deduction of $24,625, as for a bad debt. The Commissioner disallowed the claim, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n and the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed his decision. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n By reason of the conflict of decision we granted certiorari in both cases. \n310 \nU.S. 620\n, 60 S.Ct. 1079, 1082.\n The earlier revenue acts contained sections similar to 23(k) of the Act of 1934. They also embodied provisions for calculation of taxes on capital net gains. None of them included any section like 117(f). Prior to the adoption of the 1934 Act it had been held that the phrase 'sale or exchange' of capital assets, employed in those acts, was not descriptive of the redemption or call for repayment of corporate securities, and hence gain thereby occasioned was to be treated as ordinary income5, and loss so arising was to be deducted from gross income as a bad debt. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Revenue Act of 1934, by subsection (f) of  117, provided that for the purposes of the title dealing with capital gains and losses, 'amounts received by the holder upon the retirement' of such securities as are here involved, 'shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor'.\n It is plain that Congress intended by the new sub-section (f) to take out of the bad debt provision certain transactions and to place them in the category of capital gains and losses. The question is whether by employing the word 'retirement' the transactions here involved were so transferred. We hold that they were. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n 'Retirement' aptly describes what occurred in the instant cases. The statute does not use the word in an unusual or artificial sense. In common understanding and according to dictionary definition the word 'retirement' is broader in scope than 'redemption'; is not, as contended, synonymous with the latter, but includes it. Nothing in the legislative history of the provision requires us to attribute to the term used a meaning narrower than its accepted meaning in common speech.\n The taxpayer in number 58 urges that to hold sub-section (f) applicable in his case would give the provision an unjust effect, since, if he had refused to surrender his debentures for the trifling consideration offered, he could have charged off their whole cost as a bad debt under  23(k). The answer is that we must apply the statute as we find it, leaving to Congress the correction of asserted inconsistencies and inequalities in its operation.\n The court below held in number 58 that the phrase 'retirement' could properly be applied only to voluntary action on the debtor's part in fulfilment of his promise to pay. This is but to say that retirement means no more than call and redemption pursuant to the terms of the obligation. But as we have said, the two are not in common understanding the same.\n The judgment in number 55 is affirmed, and that in number 58 is reversed.\n Affirmed in No. 55.\n Reversed in No. 58. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 689, 26 U.S.C.  23(k), 26 U.S.C.A.

STEVENS(1941)\nNo. 425\nArgued: February 13, 1941Decided: March 17, 1941\n\n\n\n Alan W. Boyd, of Indianapolis, Inc., for petitioner. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n B. A. Wendrow, of Mount Pleasant, Mich., for respondent Stevens.\n William E. Crane, of Saginaw, Mich., for respondent Northway, etc., et al., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked in effect to hold invalid a default judgment entered by a state court in a garnishment proceeding after it had denied a petition for removal to a federal district court. The principal questions are whether we may review an order of the federal district court remanding the suit to the court from which it was removed, and whether the latter court was free to disregard a disclosure filed in the federal court before the default judgment was entered. From the record the following appears.\n On March 8, 1939, respondent obtained a writ of garnishment from a Michigan state court requiring petitioner to appear on or before March 31 and disclose whether it was liable to individuals against whom respondent had recovered a judgment. On March 28, petitioner filed an application and bond in the state court for removal of the proceeding to the proper federal district court. On April 4, the state court denied the application. On April 10, petitioner filed in the federal district court copies of all papers on record in the state court and its disclosure denying any liability to respondent or to the judgment debtors. The next day, respondent entered petitioner's default in the state court for failure to appear, and notified petitioner that respondent would move for judgment on April 17.\n On April 15, petitioner notified respondent of its attempt to remove the suit notwithstanding the ruling of the state court. Respondent promptly moved to have the proceeding remanded, and on the same day the dis- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n trict judge granted the motion. The remand order was filed in the state court on April 17. Respondent thereupon entered petitioner's default a second time, introduced evidence, and obtained a default judgment. On April 18, petitioner unsuccessfully moved to vacate the judgment. Appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court followed and the judgment was affirmed. Stevens v. Northway, 293 Mich. 31, 291 N.W. 211. Because it involved important questions concerning the removal statute, 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S. C.A.  71, we brought the case here. \n311 \nU.S. 637\n, 61 S.Ct. 74, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner contends that the garnishment proceeding was removable as a separable controversy and that the state court therefore was without jurisdiction to enter the default judgment. Further, petitioner contends in substance that the petition for removal when filed in the state court deprived that court of power to proceed with the cause, at least until the federal court had passed upon the question of removability, and that in all events the refusal of the state court to accord any legal effect to the disclosure filed in the federal district court while the petition for removal was pending there was a denial of a federal right given by the removal statute, supra. We cannot agree.\n The case is ruled by Yankaus v. Feltenstein, \n244 \nU.S. 127\n, 37 S.Ct. 567.1 There we held that an order of a federal district court remanding the cause to the state court was not reviewable directly or indirectly, and affirmed the judg- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n ment of the state court even though it had been secured by default. \n2\n While the opinion does not expressly consider the effect of a petition for removal on subsequent proceedings in the state court, the clear import of the decision is that the proceedings are valid if the case was not in fact removable. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Waite, D.C., 279 F. 171; Commodores Point Terminal Co. v. Hudnall, D.C., 279 F. 606, 607; First National Bank v. Bridge Co., 9 Fed.Cas. 88, No. 4,803.3\n The rule that the remand order is not reviewable stems from  28 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S.C.A.  71, and from many decisions adjusting the relationship of state and federal courts and the scope of authority of each in cases sought to be removed from the former to the latter. The rule that proceedings in the state court subsequent to the petition for removal are valid if the suit was not in fact removable is the logical corollary of the proposition that such proceedings are void if the cause was removable.

Longest, 16 Pet. 97. 4\n When a petition for removal to a federal court is denied by the state court, the petitioner may do one of three things. He may object to the ruling, save an exception, and litigate the cause in the state courts. Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Bacon, supra; Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 \nU.S. 430\n, 6 S.Ct. 799; Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Koontz, \n104 \nU.S. 5\n; Removal Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 457\n; Gordon v. Longest, supra. He may remove the suit to the federal court despite the ruling of the state court. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Koontz, supra; Kern v. Huidekoper, \n103 \nU.S. 485\n; Home Life Ins. Co. v. Dunn, supra. He may proceed in both courts at the same time. Kern v. Huidekoper, supra; Removal Cases, supra.\n If the petitioner litigates the cause in the state court and preserves an exception, he may have the order of the state court denying his petition for removal reviewed in the state appellate court. In proper cases he may come here asserting a denial of his right of removal. Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Bacon, supra; Stone v. South Carolina, supra; Removal Cases, supra. If he removes the cause to the federal district court despite the state court ruling and the federal court assumes jurisdiction over the objection of his adversary, the latter, after final judgment, may contest this assumption of jurisdiction in the circuit court of appeals, and in this court in proper cases. Powers v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n169 \nU.S. 92\n, 18 S.Ct. 264; Cates v. Allen, \n149 \nU.S. 451\n, 13 S.Ct. 883; Graves v. Corbin, 132 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 571, 10 S.Ct. 196. If petitioner proceeds simultaneously in state and federal courts and both render final judgments, he and his adversary may obtain review of the question of removability by following respectively the courses just outlined. Kern v. Huidekoper, supra; Removal Cases. supra.\n Petitioner is protected whichever course he elects. If he makes timely application for removal and properly objects to its denial by the state court, participation in subsequent proceedings in the state court is not a waiver of his claim that the cause should have been litigated in the federal court. Powers v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., supra; Removal Cases, supra; Home Life Ins. Co. v. Dunn, supra. Compare Miller v. Buyer, 82 Colo. 474, 261 P. 659; State v. American Surety Co., 26 Idaho 652, 145 P. 1097, Ann.Cas.1916E, 209; Ashland v. Whitcomb, 120 Wis. 549, 98 N.W. 531. If he removes the cause notwithstanding the state court ruling, he may nevertheless resist further action by his opponent in the state court. Kern v. Huidekoper, supra; Removal Cases, supra.\n However, the issue of removability is closed if the federal district court refuses to assume jurisdiction and remands the cause. Section 28 of the Judical Code, supra, precludes review of the remand order directly ( Kloeb v. Armour & Co., \n311 \nU.S. 199\n, 61 S.Ct. 213; Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, \n299 \nU.S. 374\n, 57 S.Ct. 273; City of Waco v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n293 \nU.S. 140\n, 55 S. Ct. 6; Ex parte Pennsylvania Co., \n137 \nU.S. 451\n, 11 S.Ct. 141), or indirectly after final judgment in the highest court of the state in which decision could be had. McLaughlin Brothers v. Hallowell, \n228 \nU.S. 278\n, 33 S.Ct. 465; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Fitzgerald, \n160 \nU.S. 556\n, 16 S.Ct. 389; compare Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Lewis, \n241 \nU.S. 440\n, 36 S.Ct. 637\n\n\n Here, petitioner attempted to remove the cause, as he had a right to do, even though the state court had denied his petition for removal. The federal court held it was \n\n[312 \nU.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n not removable as a separable controversy and remanded it to the state court. For the reasons already stated, we are not at liberty to review the remand order. Consequently, we must assume, so far as this case is concerned, that the suit was not removable. Having made this assumption, we must conclude that the state court had jurisdiction to enter the default judgment (Yankaus v. Felterstein, supra; Southern Pacific Co. v. Waite, supra), and it was for that court to determine the effect of the disclosure filed in the federal court. Ayres v. Wiswall, \n112 \nU.S. 187\n, 5 S. Ct. 90; Broadway Ins. Co. v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., C.C., 101 F. 507; compare Tracy Loan & Trust Co. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 79 Utah 33, 7 P.2d 279. If, in cases like the present one, the state court is assured that the federal court will decide promptly the question of removability, it is better practice to await that decision (Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. McCabe, \n213 \nU.S. 207\n, 29 S.Ct. 430; Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co v. Koontz, supra), but we cannot say that failure to do so is a denial of a federal right if the cause was not removable.\n Accordingly, the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Feltenstein and another brought suit in a state court against Yankaus on October 11, 1915. On October 16, Yankaus filed a petition for removal in the state court, and on October 20 filed copies of all papers on record in the state court and an answer in the federal court. On the latter date the state court denied his petition for removal, and on October 26 entered judgment against him. On November 15, the federal court remanded the cause, and two weeks later the state court denied a motion to vacate the judgment. The state appellate court subsequently dismissed an appeal. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is not evident from the opinion that the judgment was taken by default, but this fact clearly appears in the record filed in this Court.

MEADOWMOOR(1941)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: February 10, 1941\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Mar. 17, 1941\n\n\n See \n312 \nU.S. 715\n, 61 S.Ct. 803, 85 L.Ed. --. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Abraham W. Brussell, of Chicago, Ill., Joseph Padway, of Washington, D.C., and Myron D. Alexander, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Donald N. Schaffer, Roy Massena, and Charles S. Deneen, all of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The supreme court of Illinois sustained an injunction against the Milk Wagon Drivers Union over the latter's claim that it involved an infringement of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Since this ruling raised a question intrinsically important, as well as affecting the scope of Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, and Carlson v. California, \n310 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 746, we brought the case here. \n310 \nU.S. 655\n, 60 S.Ct. 1092.\n The 'vendor system' for distributing milk in Chicago gave rise to the dispute. Under that system, which was fully analyzed in Milk Wagon Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, 61 S.Ct. 122, milk is sold by the dairy companies to vendors operating their own trucks who resell to retailers. These vendors departed from the working standards theretofore achieved by the Union for its members as dairy employees. The Union, in order to compel observance of the established standards, took action against dairies using the vendor system. The present respondent, Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., brought suit against the Union and its officials to stop interference with the distribution of its products. A preliminary injunction restraining all Union conduct, violent and peaceful, promptly issued, and the case was referred to a master for report. Besides peaceful picketing of the stores handling Meadowmoor's products, the master found that there had been violence on a considerable scale. Witnesses testified to more than fifth instances of window-smashing; explosive bombs caused substantial injury to the plants of Meadowmoor and another dairy using the vendor system and to five stores; stench bombs were dropped in five stores; three trucks of vendors were wrecked, seriously injuring one driver, and another was driven into a river; a store was set on fire and in large \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n measure ruined; two trucks of vendors were burned; a storekeeper and a truck driver were severely beaten; workers at a dairy which, like Meadowmoor, used the vendor system were held with guns and severely beaten about the head while being told 'to join the union'; carloads of men followed vendors' trucks, threatened the drivers, and in one instance shot at the truck and driver. In more than a dozen of these occurrences, involving window-smashing, bombings, burnings, the wrecking of trucks, shootings, and beatings, there was testimony to identify the wrongdoers as union men. \n1\n In the light of his findings, the master recommended that all picketing, and not merely violent acts, should be enjoined. The trial court, however, accepted the recommendations only as to acts of violence and permitted peaceful picketing. The reversal of this ruling by the supreme court, 371 Ill. 377, 21 N.E.2d 308, directing a permanent injunction as recommended by the master, is now before us.\n The question which thus emerges is whether a state can choose to authorize its courts to enjoin acts of picketing in themselves peaceful when they are enmeshed with contemporaneously violent conduct which is concededly outlawed. The Constitution is invoked to deny Illinois the power to authorize its courts to prevent the continuance and recurrence of flagrant violence, found after an extended litigation to have occurred under specific circumstances, by the terms of a decree familiar in such cases. Such a decree, arising out of a particular controversy and adjusted to it, raises totally different constitutional problems from those that would be presented by an abstract statute with an overhanging and undefined threat to free utterance. To assimilate the two is \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n to deny to the states their historic freedom to deal with controversies through the concreteness of individual litigation rather than through the abstractions of a general law.\n The starting point is Thornhill's case. That case invoked the constitutional protection of free speech on behalf of a relatively modern means for 'publicizing, without annoyance or threat of any kind, the facts of a labor dispute'. \n310 \nU.S. 100\n, 60 S.Ct. 743. The whole series of cases defining the scope of free speech under the Fourteenth Amendment are facets of the same principle in that they all safeguard modes appropriate for assuring the right to utterance in different situations. Peaceful picketing is the workingman's means of communication.\n It must never be forgotten, however, that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment. Back of the guarantee of free speech lay faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the peaceful means for gaining access to the mind. It was in order to avert force and explosions due to restrictions upon rational modes of communication that the guarantee of free speech was given a generous scope. But utterance in a context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution.\n Still it is of prime importance that no constitutional freedom, least of all the guarantees of the Bill of Rights, be defeated by insubstantial findings of fact screening reality. That is why this Court has the ultimate power to search the records in the state courts where a claim of constitutionality is effectively made. And so the right of free speech cannot be denied by drawing from a trivial rough incident or a moment of animal exuberance the conclusion that otherwise peaceful picketing has the taint of force. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n In this case the master found 'intimidation of the customers of the plaintiff's vendors by the Commission of the acts of violence', and the supreme court justified its decision because picketing, 'in connection with or following a series of assaults or destruction of property, could not help but have the effect of intimidating the persons in front of whose premises such picketing occurred and of causing them to believe that non- compliance would possibly be followed by acts of an unlawful character'. It is not for us to make an independent valuation of the testimony before the master. We have not only his findings but his findings authenticated by the state of Illinois speaking through her supreme court. We can reject such a determination only if we can say that it is so without warrant as to be a palpable evasion of the constitutional guarantee here invoked. The place to resolve conflicts in the testimony and in its interpretation was in the Illinois courts and not here. To substitute our judgment for that of the state court is to transcend the limits of our authority. And to do so in the name of the Fourteenth Amendment in a matter peculiarly touching the local policy of a state regarding violence tends to discredit the great immunities of the Bill of Rights. No one will doubt that Illinois can protect its storekeepers from being coerced by fear of window- smashings or burnings or bombings. And acts which in isolation are peaceful may be part of a coercive thrust when entangled with acts of violence. The picketing in this case was set in a background of violence. In such a setting it could justifiably be concluded that the momentum of fear generated by past violence would survive even though future picketing might be wholly peaceful. So the supreme court of Illinois found. We cannot say that such a finding so contradicted experience as to warrant our rejection. Nor can we say that it was written into the Fourteenth Amendment that a state \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n through its courts cannot base protection against future coercion on an inference of the continuing threat of past misconduct. Cf. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n, 60 S.Ct. 618.\n These acts of violence are neither episodic nor isolated. Judges need not be so innocent of the actualities of such an industrial conflict as this record discloses as to find in the Constitution a denial of the right of Illinois to conclude that the use of force on such a scale was not the conduct of a few irresponsible outsiders. The Fourteenth Amendment still leaves the state ample discretion in dealing with manifestations of force in the settlement of industrial conflicts. And in exercising its power a state is not to be treated as though the technicalities of the laws of agency were written into the Constitution. Certainly a state is not confined by the Constitution to narrower limits in fashioning remedies for dealing with industrial disputes than the scope of discretion open to the National Labor Relations Board. It is true of a union as of an employer that it may be responsible for acts which it has not expressly authorized or which might not be attributable to it on strict application of the rules of respondeat superior. International Ass'n of Machinists v. Labor Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72, 80\n, 61 S.Ct. 83; Heinz Co. v. Labor Board, \n311 \nU.S. 514\n, 61 S.Ct. 320. To deny to a state the right to a judgment which the National Labor Relations Board has been allowed to make in cognate situations, would indeed be distorting the Fourteenth Amendment with restrictions upon state power which it is not our business to impose. A state may withdraw the injunction from labor controversies but no less certainly the Fourteenth Amendment does not make unconstitutional the use of the injunction as a means of restricting violence. We find nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that prevents a state if it so chooses from placing confidence in a chancellor's decree and compels it to rely exclusively on a policeman's club. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 296]\n\u00a0\n We have already adverted to the generous scope that must be given to the guarantee of free speech. Especially is this attitude to be observed where, as in labor controversies, the feelings of even the most detached minds may become engaged and a show of violence may make still further demands on calm judgment. It is therefore relevant to remind that the power to deny what otherwise would be lawful picketing derives from the power of the states to prevent future coercion. Right to free speech in the future cannot be forfeited because of dissociated acts of past violence. Nor may a state enjoin peaceful picketing merely because it may provoke violence in others. Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 721\n, 722 S., 51 S.Ct. 625, 633; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S. Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352. Inasmuch as the injunction was based on findings made in 1937, this decision is no bar to resort to the state court for a modification of the terms of the injunction should that court find that the passage of time has deprived the picketing of its coercive influence. In the exceptional cases warranting restraint upon normally free conduct, the restraint ought to be defined by clear and guarded language. According to the best practice, a judge himself should draw the specific terms of such restraint and not rely on drafts submitted by the parties. But we do not have revisory power over state practice, provided such practice is not used to evade constitutional guarantees. See Fox River Co. v. R.R. Comm., \n274 \nU.S. 651, 655\n, 47 S.Ct. 669, 670; Long Sault Development Co. v. Call, \n242 \nU.S. 272, 277\n, 37 S.Ct. 79, 81. We are here concerned with power and not with the wisdom of its exercise. We merely hold that in the circumstances of the record before us the injunction authorized by the supreme court of Illinois does not transgress its constitutional power. That other states have chosen a different path in such a situation indicates differences of social view in a domain in which states are free to shape their local policy. Com- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n pare Busch Jewelry Co. v. United Retail Employees' Union, 281 N.Y. 150, 22 N.E.2d 320, 124 A.L.R. 744, and Baillis v. Fuchs, 283 N.Y. 133, 27 N.E.2d 812.\n To maintain the balance of our federal system, insofar as it is committed to our care, demands at once zealous regard for the guarantees of the Bill of Rights and due recognition of the powers belonging to the states. Such an adjustment requires austere judgment, and a precise summary of the result may help to avoid misconstruction.\n\n\n (1)\n We do not qualify the Thornhill and Carlson decisions. We reaffirm them. The involved statutes baldly forbidding all picketing near an employer's place of business. Entanglement with violence was expressly out of those cases. The statutes had to be dealt with on their face, and therefore we struck them down. Such an unlimited ban on free communication declared as the law of a state by a state court enjoys no greater protection here. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352; American Federation of Labor v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, 61 S.Ct. 568, 85 L.Ed. --, No. 56 this term, this day decided. But just as a state through its legislature may deal with specific circumstances menacing the peace by an appropriately drawn act, Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, so the law of a state may be fitted to a concrete situation through the authority given by the state to its courts. This is precisely the kind of situation which the Thornhill opinion excluded from its scope. 'We are not now concerned with picketing en masse or otherwise conducted which might occasion such imminent and aggravated danger ... as to justify a statute narrowly drawn to cover the precise situation giving rise to the danger.' \n310 \nU.S. 105\n, 60 S.Ct. 745, 746. 2 We would not strike down a statute which author- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 298]\n\u00a0\n ized the courts of Illinois to prohibit picketing when they should find that violence had given to the picketing a coercive effect whereby it would operate destructively as force and intimidation. Such a situation is presented by this record. It distorts the meaning of things to generalize the terms of an injunction derived from and directed towards violent misconduct as though it were an abstract prohibition of all picketing wholly unrelated to the violence involved.\n\n\n (2)\n The exercise of the state's power which we are sustaining is the very antithesis of a ban on all discussion in Chicago of a matter of public importance. Of course we would not sustain such a ban. The injunction is confined to conduct near stores dealing in respondent's milk, and it deals with this narrow area precisely because the coercive conduct affected it. An injunction so adjusted to a particular situation is in accord with the settled practice of equity, sanctioned by such guardians of civil liberty as Mr. Justice Cardozo. Compare Nann v. Raimist, 255 N.Y. 307, 174 N.E. 690, 73 A.L.R. 669. Such an injunction must be read in the context of its circumstances. Nor ought state action be held unconstitutional by interpreting the law of the state as though, to use a phrase of Mr. Justice Holmes, one were fired with a zeal to pervert. If an appropriate injunction were put to abnormal uses in its enforcement, so that encroachments were made on free discussion outside the limits of violence, as for instance discussion through newspapers or on the radio, the doors of this Court are always open.\n\n\n (3)\n The injunction which we sustain is 'permanent' only for the temporary period for which it may last. It is justified only by the violence that induced it and only so long as it counteracts a continuing intimidation. Familiar equity procedure assures opportunity for modifying or vacating an injunction when its continuance is no longer warranted. Here again, the state courts have not \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 299]\n\u00a0\n the last say. They must act in subordination to the duty of this court to enforce constitutional liberties even when denied through spurious findings of fact in a state court. Compare Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472. Since the Union did not urge that the coercive effect had disappeared either before us or, apparently, before the state court, that question is not now here.\n\n\n (4)\n A final word. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press cannot be too often invoked as basic to our scheme of society. But these liberties will not be advanced or even maintained by denying to the states with all their resources, including the instrumentality of their courts, the power to deal with coercion due to extensive violence. If the people of Illinois desire to withdraw the use of the injunction in labor controversies, the democratic process for legislative reform is at their disposal. On the other hand, if they choose to leave their courts with the power which they have historically exercised, within the circumscribed limits which this opinion defines, and we deny them that instrument of government, that power has been taken from them permanently. Just because these industrial conflicts raise anxious difficulties, it is most important for us not to intrude into the realm of policy-making by reading our own notions into the Constitution.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissenting.\n In my belief the opinion just announced gives approval to an injunction which seriously infringes upon the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and the press. To such a result I cannot agree.\n Before detailing the reasons for my disagreement, some preliminary observations will doubtless aid in clarifying the subsidiary issues. The right of the Illinois courts to enjoin violence is not denied in this case. And I agree \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 300]\n\u00a0\n that nothing in the Federal Constitution deprives them of that right. But it is claimed that Illinois-through its courts-has here sanctioned an injunction so sweeping in its terms as to deny to petitioners and others their constitutional rights freely to express their views on matters of public concern. And this is the single federal question we must decide. In their brief, petitioners state that they 'have never and do not at the present time in any way condone or justify any violence by any member of the defendant union. Petitioners did not object to the issuance of an injunction restraining acts of violence. There is no contention made that the act of the Chancellor in granting such an injunction was erroneous.' \n1\n 'Ethically, morally and legally', the petitioning union disclaims and condemns the acts of violence. And the master who conducted the hearings in the case specifically found that the union officials had instructed their pickets to refrain from violence. \n2\n The record shows that \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 301]\n\u00a0\n the officials gave these instructions (which were obeyed), not only because they realized that resort to force and violence would be reprehensible and indefensible, but also because they recognized that such lawless conduct injures a labor union far more than it helps it. Aside from this, it cannot be doubted that attempts to persuade others by the application of physical force and violence as a substitute for persuasion by reason and peaceable argument is contrary to the first principles of our government. Nor can it be questioned that it is a prime function of courts to provide law enforcement means intended both to punish such illegal conduct and to protect against it. But this great responsibility is entrusted to courts not merely to determine the guilt or innocence of defendants, but to do so in such manner that those brought before them may enjoy a trial in which all their constitutional rights are safeguarded- including the constitutional guaranties of freedom of speech and the press.\n In determining whether the injunction does deprive petitioners of their constitutional liberties, we cannot and should not lose sight of the nature and importance of the particular liberties that are at stake. And in reaching my conclusion I view the guaranties of the First Amendment3 as the foundation upon which our governmental structure rests and without which it could not continue to endure as conceived and planned. \n4\n Free- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 302]\n\u00a0\n dom to speak and write about public questions is as important to the life of our government as is the heart to the human body. In fact, this privilege is the heart of our government. If that heart be weakened, the result is debilitation; if it be stilled, the result is death.\n In addition, I deem it essential to our federal system that the states should be left wholly free to govern within the ambit of their powers. Their deliberate governmental actions should not lightly be declared beyond their powers. For us to shear them of power not denied to them by the Federal Constitution would amount to judicial usurpation. But this Court has long since-and I think properly-committed itself to the doctrine that a state cannot, through any agency, either wholly remove, or partially whittle away, the vital individual freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. And in solemnly adjudicating the validity of state action touching these cherished privileges we cannot look merely at the surface of things, for were we to do so these constitutional guaranties would become barren and sterile. We must look beneath the surface, and must carefully examine each step in proceedings which lead a court to enjoin peaceful discussion. In this case, in order to determine whether or not the state has overstepped constitutional boundaries, I find it necessary to give consideration to a number of factors, including the nature of the proceedings; the definiteness, indefiniteness and constitutional validity of the basic law upon which the injunction is said to rest; the findings and the evidence; the definiteness, indefiniteness and scope of the language \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 303]\n\u00a0\n of the injunction itself; and the alleged imminence of the threatened dangers said to justify the admitted abridgment of free speech. My conclusion that the injunction as directed by the Supreme Court of Illinois invades the constitutional guaranties of freedom of speech and the press rests on my belief that these propositions are correct: (1) the subjects banned from public discussion by the injunction are matters of public concern, touching which the Constitution guarantees the right of freedom of expression; (2) the law of Illinois, as declared by its Supreme Court, makes illegal the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed privileges, and is an inadequate basis upon which to defend this abridgment of free speech; (3) the rule upon which the injunction is supported here and which this Court now declares to be the Illinois law is not the rule upon which the Illinois Supreme Court relied; (4) the rule announced here as supporting the right of a state to abridge freedom of expression is so general and sweeping in its implications that it opens up broad possibilities for invasion of these constitutional rights; (5) in any event, the injunction here approved is too broad and sweeping in its terms to find justification under the rule announced by the Illinois court, and even though under other circumstances such an injunction would be permissible under the rule now announced by this Court, still in this case such an injunction is supported neither by the findings nor the evidence.\n First. What petitioners were enjoined from discussing were matters of public concern 'within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution.' \n5\n The controversy here was not a mere private quarrel between individuals, involving their interests alone. This injunction dealt with two conflicting methods of milk distribution-a matter of interest not only to Chi- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 304]\n\u00a0\n cago's 148 dairies, their employees and their hundreds of retail outlets, but to the mass of milk consumers in the Chicago area as well. The older method of distribution, by which members of the petitioning union are employed, distributes a major part of the milk supply by door-to-door deliveries to the ultimate consumer. The rival method of distribution, in which respondent engages, takes two forms: the dairies using this method sell their milk to 'cut-rate' stores, either directly or through the medium of so-called 'vendors.' The cutrate stores sell milk at a retail price 2 cents a quart less than that fixed by the dairies employing union labor. According to the court below, the system of cut-rate distribution, resulting in loss of business by the union dairies, loss of employment by the union drivers, and loss of a thousand members by the union itself, is at the root of a long-standing controversy. Not only this: the situation here is an intimate part of the larger problem of milk production and distribution throughout the country, and, indeed, of the still larger problem of all sorts of cut-rate distribution. There are thus involved trade practices which are not confined to Chicago alone-trade practices in which there is known to be a distinct cleavage in public thought throughout the nation.\n Second. In essence, the Illinois Supreme Court held that it was illegal for a labor union to publicize the fact of its belief that a cut- rate business system was injurious to the union and to the public, since such publicity necessarily discouraged that system's prospective purchasers. This conclusion of the court was based on the following reasoning: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Illinois Constitution, art. 2,  2, considered (in some way not made clear) in connection with the unwritten 'common law', assure respondent the unqualified right to do business free from all unjustifiable inter- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 305]\n\u00a0\n ference; publication and peaceful argument intended to persuade respondent's customers that its methods of doing business were such that they should not buy the dairy's products were therefore illegal interference; the union's purpose to better working conditions of its members was no justification for its peaceful discussion of the controversy. Neither the presence nor the absence of violence was considered by the court to be a necessary element in its conclusion. All this was but to say that in this controversy peaceful criticism of the 'vendor system' was illegal because it might injure respondent's business by discouraging trade. But Illinois cannot, without nullifying constitutional guaranties, make it illegal to marshal public opinion against these general business practices. An agreement so to marshal public opinion is protected by the Constitution, even though called a 'common-law' conspiracy or a 'common-law' tort. Despite invidious names, it is still nothing more than an attempt to persuade people that they should look with favor upon one side of a public controversy.\n Third. But this Court sustains the injunction on the ground that the Illinois Supreme Court 'justified its decision' by reference to violence, thereby indicating that that characteristic was made an essential element of the rule from which the injunction sprang. I do not so read that court's opinion, and apparently the Illinois Supreme Court itself does not so read it. That this is true is evidenced by that court's language in a later decision where, speaking of the present case, it said: 'In that case there was some evidence of violence, but ... the issue of violence was not the turning point of the decision.' \n6\n And even if violence were unintentionally included or incidentally referred to in the course of formulating a \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 306]\n\u00a0\n rule touching the right of free speech, such an unintentional inclusion or incidental reference is too uncertain a support upon which to rest a deprivation of this vital privilege.\n Fourth. There is no state statute upon which either this Court or the Supreme Court of Illinois could have relied in sustaining the injunction. \n7\n Assuming that the Supreme Court of Illinois did declare the rule which this Court has adopted, in doing so it has not marked the limits of the rule with the clarity which should be a prerequisite to an abridgment of free speech. Nor do I believe that this Court, even if it should, has supplied that essential definiteness. What we are here dealing with is an injunction, and not a 'statute narrowly drawn' to cover a situation threatening 'imminent and aggravated danger.' \n8\n Speaking of a similar abridgment of constitutional rights where there was no guiding legislative act, we said in Cantwell v. Connecticut: 'Violation of an Act exhibiting such a legislative judgment and narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil, would pose a question differing from that we must here answer. Such a declaration of the State's policy would weigh heavily in any challenge of the law as infringing constitutional limitations. Here, however, the judgment is based on a common law concept of the most general and undefined nature. ... Here we have a situation analogous to a conviction under a statute sweeping in a great variety \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 307]\n\u00a0\n of conduct under a general and indefinite characterization, and leaving to the executive and judicial branches too wide a discretion in its application.' \n9\n In the present case, the prohibition against the dissemination of information through peaceful picketing was but one of the many restraints imposed by the sweeping injunction. As to this one single element of the prohibitions a number of statements appear in the rule now formulated. On the one hand it is said that 'dissociated acts of past violence' are not enough to forfeit the right of free speech. On the other hand a 'background of violence' appears to be sufficient. Nor are any more definite standards or guides to be found in such clauses as 'context of violence'; 'entanglement with violence'; 'coercive effect'; 'taint of force'; and 'coercive thrust'. It is my apprehension that a rule embodying such broad generalizations opens up new possibilities for invasion of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n Fifth. In my opinion the sweeping injunction here approved is justified by neither of the rules, and is not supported by the record.\n For our purposes, in order to reach a proper conclusion as to just what is the sweep of the injunction, we must necessarily turn to the complaint, the answer, the evidence, the findings, and the decision and judgment of the Illinois courts. And whether the injunction will restrain the exercise of constitutional rights depends upon the effect it will have upon the minds of those whose freedom of expression might be abridged by its mandate. This effect in turn depends upon the language appearing upon the face of the injunction. By that language we must judge it. For this injunction does not run merely against lawyers who might give it a legalistic interpretation, but against laymen as well. Our question then \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 308]\n\u00a0\n becomes: To what extent will the layman who might wish to write about or discuss the prohibited subjects feel that he cannot do so without subjecting himself to the possibility of a jail sentence under a summary punishment for contempt? This injunction, like a criminal statute, prohibits conduct under fear of punishment. There is every reason why we should look at the injunction as we would a statute, and if upon its face it abridges the constitutional guaranties of freedom of expression, it should be stricken down. This is especially true because we must deal only with the federal question presented, which is whether petitioners have been denied their rights under the First Amendment. The injunction, like a statute, stands as an overhanging threat of future punishment. The law of Illinois has been declared by its highest court in such manner as to infringe upon constitutional guaranties. And by this injunction that law as actually applied abridges freedom of expression. Looking at the injunction, we find that under pain of future punishment by a trial judge all of the members of the petitioning union (about six thousand) are prohibited 'From interfering, hindering or otherwise discouraging or diverting, or attempting to interfere with, hinder, discourage or divert persons desirous of or contemplating purchasing milk and cream or other products aforesaid, including the use of said signs, banners or placards, and walking up and down in front of said stores as aforesaid, and further preventing the deliveries to said stores of other articles which said stores sell through retail; (or) From threatening in any manner to do the foregoing acts; ....' It surely cannot be doubted that an act of the Illinois legislature, couched in this sweeping language, would be held invalid on its face. \n10\n For this \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 309]\n\u00a0\n language is capable of being construed to mean that none of those enjoined can, without subjecting themselves to summary punishment, speak, write or publish anything anywhere or at any time which the Illinois court-acting without a jury in the exercise of its broad power to punish for contempt11- might conclude would result in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 310]\n\u00a0\n discouraging people from buying milk products of the complaining dairy. And more than that-if the language is so construed, those enjoined can be sent to jail if they even threaten to write, speak, or publish in such way as to discourage prospective milk purchasers. I find not even slight justification for an interpretation of this injunction so as to confine its prohibitions to conduct near stores dealing in respondent's milk. Neither the language of the injunction nor that of the complaint which sought the injunction indicates such a limitation. Mr. Justice Cardozo approved no such injunction as this in Nann v. Raimist, 255 N.Y. 307, 174 N.E. 690, 695, 73 A.L.R. 669. In fact, he ordered expunged from the injunction those prohibitions which impaired 'defendant's indubitable right to win converts over to its fold by recourse to peaceable persuasion, and to induce them by like methods to renounce allegiance to its rival.'\n But the injunction approved here does not stop at closing the mouths of the members of the petitioning union. It brings within its all- embracing sweep the spoken or written words of any other person 'who may ... now ... or hereafter ... agree or arrange with them ....' So, if a newspaper should 'agree or arrange' with all or some of those here enjoined to publish their side of the controversy, thereby necessarily tending to 'discourage' the sale of cut-rate milk, the publishers might likewise be subject to punishment for contempt. \n12\n Ordinarily the scope of the decree is co- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 311]\n\u00a0\n extensive with the allegations of the bill, its supporting affidavits or findings of fact. In other words, the acts enjoined are the acts alleged in the bill as the basis for complaint. \n13\n And the complaint on which the injunction here rests specifically charged that the union had caused 'announcement to be made by the public press of the City of Chicago, for the purpose of intimidating the said storekeepers and causing them to cease purchasing the milk sold by said plaintiffs through fear and terror of the renewal of said conspiracy, ....' Specific reference was made to these newspaper stories as appearing in The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Evening American. Proof was made of these publications. And the injunction of the trial judge, set aside by the Supreme Court of Illinois, specifically saved to petitioners-as in effect did Justice Cardozo in the New York case-their right to publicize their cause by means of 'advertisement or communication.' But the injunction sustained here is to be issued as prayed for in the bill of complaint. And since the acts enjoined are the acts alleged in the bill as the basis for complaint, newspaper publications of the type referred to in the complaint are literally enjoined. Since the literal language of the injunction, read in the light of the complaint, the supporting evidence, and the language of the trial judge's saving \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 312]\n\u00a0\n clause-stricken down by action sustained here-thus unconstitutionality abridges the rights of freedom of speech and press, we cannot escape our responsibility by the simple expedient of declaring that those who might be sent to jail for violating the plain language of the injunction might eventually obtain relief by appeal to this Court. To sanction vague and undefined terminologies in dragnet clauses directly and exclusively aimed at restraining freedom of discussion upon the theory that we might later acquit those convicted for violation of such terminology amounts in my judgment to a prior censorship of views. No matter how the decree might eventually be construed, its language, viewed in the light of the whole proceedings, stands like an abstract statute with an overhanging and undefined threat to freedom of speech and the press. All this, of course, is true only as to those who argue on the side of the opponents of cut- rate distribution. No such undefined threat hangs over those who 'agree or arrange' with the advocates of the cut-rate system to encourage their method of distribution.\n Nor is it any answer to say that the injunction would not be carried out in all its potential rigor. It was to obtain just these potentialities that respondent, already having secured from the trial court an injunction against acts of violence, appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court in order to secure an injunction broad enough to prevent petitioners' peaceable communication to the public of their side of the controversy. It is too much to expect that after complete approval of this abridgment of public discussion by the Supreme Court of Illinois, and after the opinion just announced, the injunction will not be enforced as written. So written, there could hardly be provided a more certain method wholly and completely to prevent all public discussion antagonistic to respondent's method of selling milk. And it is claimed by the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 313]\n\u00a0\n members of the petitioning union that foreclosure of opportunity for public discussion amounts to a death sentence for the method of business which gives them employment. The decision here thus permits state control by injunction as a substitute for competitive discussion of a controversy of particular interest to the union, and a matter of public concern as well.\n A careful study of the entire record in this case convinces me that neither the findings nor the evidence, even viewed in the light most favorable to respondent, showed such imminent, clear and present danger14 as to justify an abridgment of the rights of freedom of speech and the press. The picketing, which did not begin until September, 1934, has at all times been peaceful. Usually one picket, and never more than two, walked along the street bearing a sign. These pickets never impeded traffic either on the sidewalks or in the street, nor did they disturb any passersby or customers. In fact, it is stipulated in the record that pickets 'made no threats against any of these storekeepers, but peacefully picketed these stores. They made no attempt to stop any customers or to stop delivery except insofar as their situation and the signs they bore had that tendency.' There was no evidence to connect them with any kind or type of violence at any time or place. As was found by the master, this was in accordance with the instruction which was given to them by the union officials. \n15\n There is no \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 314]\n\u00a0\n evidence and no finding that dissemination of information by pickets stimulated anyone else to commit any act of violence.\n There was evidence that violence occurred-some committed by identified persons and some by unidentified persons. A strike of farmers supplying most of Chicago's milk took place in the early part of January, 1934. This strike practically stopped the inflow of milk into the city. As a result, the union drivers were ordered not to report for work on January 8 and 9, at the height of the strike. It was during this period that the larger part of the major acts of violence occurred. According to the complaint and the evidence, seven trucks were seized or damaged on the 8th and 9th of January, 1934, and one on the 6th. These are the only trucks that were ever seized or damaged, according to both the complaint and the evidence, and it was in connection with these seizures that the injuries to truck drivers, the shootings, and the threats reterred to in this Court's opinion took place. Undoubtedly, some of the members of the union participated in this violence, as is shown by the fact that several were arrested, criminal prosecutions were instituted, and the cases later settled with the approval of the trial judge. It was eight months after this before any picketing occurred; four years afterwards before the trial judge granted an injunction, limited to violence alone; five years before the Supreme Court of Illinois directed a more stringent injunction against peaceful persuasion; and seven years before this Court sustained the injunction.\n During the period of the farmers' strike in 1934, and in the immediately succeeding months, five stores were either bombed or burned. Three union members were tried, convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary for arson in connection with one of these burnings. All of this violence took place many months before any of the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 315]\n\u00a0\n picketing occurred. In addition to these 1934 acts of violence, the evidence showed that one stench bomb was thrown into a store in 1935, one in 1936, and two in 1937. The identity of the persons throwing these stench bombs was not shown.\n The only other violence alleged or testified to was the breaking of windows in cut-rate stores. Most of the testimony as to these acts of violence was given by respondent's vendors, and was extremely indefinite. The master made no findings as to specific acts of violence, nor as to the dates of their occurrence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to respondent, however, all of the acts of violence as to which any testimony was offered are gathered in the accompanying footnote. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[]\n Windows Trucks Stores Bombed Broken Seized or Burned Miscellaneous []\n 1934 34 8 5 4 1935 5 0 1 0 1936 7 0 1 0 1937 7 0 2 0\n 53 8 9 4 []\n Petitioners offered evidence that three men, with no union connections whatsoever, confessed to and were convicted of the smashing of windows in twenty-four cut-rate milk stores in 1934, pursuant to an insurance racket. The master struck this evidence from the record, on respondent's motion.\n In addition to the acts of violence enumerated in the foregoing table, there was evidence of six acts of violence in 1932, among them the bombing of Meadowmoor's plant referred to in the opinion. Petitioners offered evidence to show that at that time respondent was gangester-dominated, and that the gangsters in question had sought to obtain control of the union, but this evidence was excluded.\n The opinion also refers to the beating of workers at a cut-rate dairy other than Meadowmoor. The master did not mention this incident in his findings, but it is referred to in the evidence, and from that source it appears that those beaten and told 'to join the union' were inside workers not eligible for membership in the petitioning union. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 316]\n\u00a0\n It is on the basis of my study of the entire record that I rest my conclusion that the forfeiture of the right to free speech effected by the injunction is not warranted. In reaching this conclusion, I fully recognize that the union members guilty of violence were subject to punishment in accordance with the principles of due process of law. And some of them have in fact been prosecuted and convicted. Punishment of lawless conduct is in accord with the necessities of government and is essential to the peace and tranquillity of society. But it is going a long way to say that because of the acts of these few men, six thousand other members of their union can be denied the right to express their opinion to the extent accomplished by the sweeping injunction here sustained. \n17\n Even those convicted of crime are not in this country punished by having their freedom of expression curtailed except under prison rules and regulations, and then only for the duration of their sentence.\n No one doubts that Illinois can protect its storekeepers from being coerced by fear of damage to their property from window-smashing, or burnings or bombings. And to that end Illinois is free to use all its vast resources and powers, nor should this Court stand in the way so long as Illinois does not take away from its people rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States. When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 317]\n\u00a0\n interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order appears, the power of the Illinois courts to prevent or punish is obvious. \n18\n Furthermore, this is true because a state has the power to adopt laws of general application to provide that the streets shall be used for the purpose for which they primarily exist, and because the preservation of peace and order is one of the first duties of government. But in a series of cases we have held that local laws ostensibly passed pursuant to this admittedly possessed general power could not be enforced in such a way as to amount to a prior censorship on freedom of expression, or to abridge that freedom as to those rightfully and lawfully on the streets. \n19\n Illinois, like all the other states of the Union, is part of a national democratic system the continued existence of which depends upon the right of free discussion of public affairs-a right whose denial to some leads in the direction of it eventual denial to all. I am of opinion that the court's injunction strikes directly at the heart of our government, and that deprivation of these essential liberties cannot be reconciled with the rights guaranteed to the people of this Nation by their Constitution.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice REED dissenting.\n My conclusion is that the injunction ordered by the Supreme Court of Illinois violates the constitutional rights of the Milk Wagon Drivers Union of Chicago, its officers and members. The Court reaches a contrary \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 318]\n\u00a0\n result on the ground that a state may 'authorize its courts to enjoin acts of picketing in themselves peaceful when they are enmeshed with contemporaneously violent conduct which is concededly outlawed.' Since this controversy, by virtue of the Court's opinion, centers around picketing as a phase of free speech rather than around the more general topic of freedom of expression, I desire to state for myself the reasons which lead me to the conviction that the judgment should be reversed. A principle is thus involved, as well as a dispute over the scope of a court injunction.\n The record shows inexcusable acts of violence, committed at least in part by members of the union. For such conduct, the offenders are subject to punishment by the criminal laws of Illinois. The future conduct of the rioters is also subject to state control by injunction, exercised within the limits of the Constitution. The burden and the duty of maintaining law and order fall primarily on Illinois. Whether it chooses an injunction against violence alone or against violence and peaceful picketing, it must be assumed that its commands will be obeyed. It is a postulate of reasoned thinking that the judicial decrees will be faithfully carried out. This question then emerges. Is the right to picket peacefully an employer's place of business lost for any period of future time by past acts of violence? The trial court, in this very case, while prohibiting all violence, permitted by its injunction the continuance of efforts by the union, either singly or in concert, to peaceably persuade others by picketing or other lawful means to support its contentions.\n Where nothing further appears, it is agreed that peaceful picketing, since it is an exercise of freedom of speech, may not be prohibited by injunction or by statute. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736; American Federation of Labor v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, 61 S. Ct. 568, 85 L.Ed. --, No. 56, decided today. It is equally clear that \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 319]\n\u00a0\n the right to picket is not absolute. It may, if actually necessary, be limited, let us say, to two or three individuals at a time and their manner of expressing their views may be reasonably restricted to an orderly presentation. Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, 310 U.S. page 105, 60 S. Ct. 745. From the standpoint of the state, industrial controversy may not overstep the bounds of an appeal to reason and sympathy.\n The Court now determines that where there is a background of violence, and inferentially, I think it must be admitted, that where there is a reasonable fear of violence, the freedom of speech which is secured to all persons by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution may be withdrawn. It finds its justification in the authority of Illinois to 'protect its storekeepers from being coerced by fear of window-smashings or burnings or bombings.' The momentum of fear from past violence, it is thought, would reach over into the peaceful picketing of the future. This goes much farther than the injunction approved by this Court in Hague v. C. I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 517\n, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 965, which forbade interferences with the liberty of free speech but left to the guardians of public peace the right 'to enforce law and order by lawful search and seizure or by arrest and production before a judicial officer.' This authority of Illinois to protect its storekeepers must be exercised, however, within the framework of the Constitution. If Illinois were not a member of the United States, but a sovereign without exterior political or social obligations, it would be in a position to use whatever means it or its courts might decide would best put an end to labor disturbances. As a state of the Union it is subject to the restraints of the Constitution. If the fear engendered by past misconduct coerces storekeepers during peaceful picketing, the remedy lies in the maintenance of order, not in denial of free speech. Constitutional guarantees against oppression are of value only when needed to challenge attacks. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 320]\n\u00a0\n The right to picket peacefully in industrial disputes is a recognized means for the marshaling of public opinion on the side of the worker. There is no finding that violence was planned or encouraged by the union. To deny this right of peaceful picketing to thousands because of the violence of a few means the cutting off of one of the constitutionally protected ways in which orderly adjustments of economic disputes are brought about. I cannot see that the constitutional problem is 'totally different' because raised by a court decree rather than a statute. Constitutional guarantees are just as effective for the individual as they are for the general public. The principle contended for by petitioners is the right to tell their side of the story by peaceful picketing despite a state court's view that such picketing may project fear from past violence into the future. In the last analysis we must ask ourselves whether this protection against assumed fear of future coercion flowing from past violence is sufficient to justify the suspension of the constitutional guarantee of free speech. If picketing is prohibited here, the right maintained by Thornhill v. Alabama collapses on the first attack.\n This nation relies upon public discussion as one of the indispensable means to attain correct solutions of problems of social welfare. Curtailment of free speech limits this open discussion. Our whole history teaches that adjustment of social relations through reason is possible while free speech is maintained. This Court has the solemn duty of determining when acts of legislation or decrees of courts infringe that right guaranteed to all citizens. Free speech may be absolutely prohibited only under the most pressing national emergencies. Those emergencies must be of the kind that justify the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus or the suppression of the right of trial by jury. Nothing approaching this situation exists in this record and, in my judgment, the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 287, 321]\n\u00a0\n action of the Supreme Court of Illinois in prohibiting peaceful picketing violates the constitutional rights of these petitioners. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It would needlessly encumber the reports to quote in detail the evidence thus summarized. The curious may turn to the record in the case. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, also, this statement in the Carlson opinion: 'The power and duty of he State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted.' \n310 \nU.S. 113\n, 60 S.Ct. 749. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The record shows that in a petition to determine damages, filed even before the trial court entered its final order, the petitioners said: 'The court was informed at that time (when the original effort was made to secure dissolution of the temporary injunction) that the defendants and each of them, were wholly in accord with the injunction prohibiting violence of any kind. ...' R. 265. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'That the instructions given to such persons so patrolling or picketing by the officers of the defendant Union have been to do same peacefully and not to interfere with the ordinary course of business in said stores, except to patrol back and forth with said placards.' R. 230, 231.\n Meadowmoor had originally sought an injunction in the federal District Court. The federal master's report, introduced in this case as an exhibit for Meadowmoor, states: 'I further find that the instructions given to such persons patrolling or peacefully picketing by the officers of the defendant association have been not to speak or carry on any conversation with any other person or persons in front of the said premises, nor to interfere with the orderly course of business of the said stores, except to patrol back and forth with the said placard.' R. 165. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' It is now too well settled to require citation that by the Fourteenth Amendment the guaranties of the First Amendment are protected against abridgment by the states. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Thomas Jefferson, the great strategist of the campaign to bring about the adoption of the Bill of Rights, a campaign which he began even before the Constitution was adopted, said as to one of the guaranties of the First Amendment: 'The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Thornhill v.

Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, 2 Labor Cases 567, 568 ( Opinion withdrawn.

The Supreme Court said that this statute was modeled on the federal Clayton Act (38 Stat. 738, 29 U.S.C.  52, 29 U.S.C.A.  52). But the court held that the facts here did not constitute the type of 'labor dispute' to which the act applied. 371 Ill. 377, at pages 383-386, 21 N.E.2d 308. Cf. Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, 61 S.Ct. 122. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Thornhill v.

With a change of but one word, a passage from the Carlson case is directly applicable to the present case: 'The sweeping and inexact terms of the ( injunction) disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence. It cannot be thought to differ in any material respect from the statute held void in Thornhill's case.' 310 U.S. at page 112, 60 S.Ct. at pages 748, 749. And a comparison of the language of the statutes held invalid in the Thornhill and Carlson cases with that of the injunction here sustained is very revealing: Thornhill statute: 'go(ing) near to or loiter(ing) about the premises or place of business ...; influencing ... persons not to trade ...; picket(ing) the works or place of business ....' Code Ala.1923,  3448. Meadowmoor injunction: 'walking up and down in front of said stores ...; discouraging ... persons ... contemplating purchasing ...; interfering, hindering, or ... divert(ing) ... persons desirous of ... purchasing ...; us(ing) signs, banners or placards ... in front of said stores. ...' Carlson statute: 'loiter(ing) in front of ... any place of business ...; influencing ... any person to refrain from purchasing ...; intimidating, threatening or coercing ... any person ...; display(ing) any banner ... badge or sign in front of ... any place of business ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] In Illinois, the power to punish summarily for contempt is said to be a broad 'inherent' power of courts, 'independent of statutory provisions' and of 'constitutional grant.' Schmidt v. Cooper, 274 Ill. 243, 250, 113 N.E. 641, 644; People v. Peters, 305 Ill. 223, 226, 227, 137 N.E. 118, 26 A.L.R. 16. And where a trial judge has ruled that conduct is or is not contempt, the appellate court will not interfere unless the trial judge's findings are 'manifestly against the weight of the evidence' or 'clearly and palpably contrary' to it. See Oehler v. Levy, 256 Ill. 178, 183, 99 N.E. 912, 913; Boyden v. Boyden, 162 Ill.App. 77, 83; American Cigar Co. v.

And where the trial court has determined the extent of the punishment to be inflicted, 'courts of appellate jurisdiction will not interfere with the exercise of such discretion except for its abuse.' Ash-Madden-Rae Co. v. International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, 290 Ill. 301, 306, 125 N.E. 258, 260 (violation of injunction against picketing). \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Cf. Cohen v. United States, 6 Cir., 295 F. 633; Taliaferro v. United States, 4 Cir., 290 F. 906; United States v. Taliaferro, D.C., 290 F. 214. Cohen, 'the owner, editor, and publisher' of a newspaper, was convicted of contempt by the District Court under an injunction restraining 'strikers and their sympathizers.' (295 F. 634, 635.) The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Taliaferro, a barber in no way connected with a railroad strike, was convicted of contempt under an injunction restraining union members and those 'associated with them.' Taliaferro's offense consisted in placing in his window a sign saying 'No Scabs Wanted in Here.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. And see Illinois Malleable Iron Co. v.

Federal Trade Commission, \n312 \nU.S. 457\n, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. --, this day decided. Here, as in that case, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a Federal Trade Commission decree ordering the petitioners to cease and desist from certain practices found to have been done in combination and to constitute 'unfair methods of competition' tending to monopoly. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n The members of the Guild involved in this case are designers and manufacturers of women's hats. Their Guild operates a plan modelled after that of the Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc.\n It was stipulated by the parties that 'The capacity, tendency, purpose and result of the plan ... and the acts and practices performed thereunder ... have been, and now are, to restrain commerce by eliminating manufacturers of stylish hats ... as to the outlets of their products and by limiting the retail dealers ... as to their source of supply, and to deprive the public of the benefits, if any, of competition as to price or otherwise among retailers of stylish hats in this respect ....' Pursuant to the evidence and to the stipulation containing this statement, the Commission found that the effect of the plan was 'unduly to hinder competition and to create monopoly in the sale of women's hats in interstate commerce.'\n The respects in which the plan of the Millinery Creators' Guild differs from that of the Fashion Originators' Guild are not material, and need not be set out in detail. Nor need the findings of the Commission be enumerated here. The Commission did find that the Millinery Creators' Guild had tended to hinder competition and create monopoly 'By depriving the public of the benefits of normal price competition among retailers of stylish hats for women', a finding not made in the other case, but the presence or absence of such a finding is not determinative here.

Button, of New York City, for appellee Columbia Oil & Gasoline Corp.\n Mr. James H. Lee, of Detroit, Mich., for City of Detroit as amicus curiae by Special leave of Court.\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Thurman W. Arnold, Asst. Atty. Gen'l, for appellee United States.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These proceedings grow out of a suit in equity brought by the Attorney General in 1935 to enforce the anti- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n trust laws. That suit was terminated by a consent decree the terms of which specifically reserved certain rights to the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company. The issues here revolve around the scope of those provisions of the decree.\n In its bill the Government charged that Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation and its controlled instrumentality, Columbia Oil & Gasoline Corporation, together with individual defendants, had conspired, for the benefit of Columbia Gas, to shut out operation in the Indiana-Ohio- Michigan area by the Panhandle Company, which had built a natural gas pipe line from the Texas fields to the border of Indiana. Panhandle was an offspring of Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Company (hereafter called Mokan), which, at the inception of the Government's suit, still owned half of Panhandle's stock and held half its junior debt. Columbia Gas, it was charged, had a practical monopoly of natural gas in the market which Panhandle proposed to enter, and to maintain this monopoly Columbia Gas acquired domination of Panhandle through the acquisition by Columbia Oil of half of Panhandle's stock and junior debt and its whole senior debt. These acts stifled, so it was claimed, Panhandle's potential competition, rendered it insolvent, and forced Mokan into receivership.\n The consent decree sought to assure opportunities for competition by Panhandle. Deeming the terms of the decree inadequate for its purpose, the Government in 1939 reopened the proceedings. The defendants proposed modifications of the decree by a plan which the district court referred to a master. After the master's report approving the plan had been submitted but before the district court had acted upon it, two attempts to intervene were made on bahalf of Panhandle. The de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n nial of these two motions by the district court is the basis of the appeals here which come to us directly under the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29. In No. 268 Mokan, as a stockholder of Panhandle, made the appropriate allegations as to the unwillingness of those responsible for the actions of the corporation to protect its interests, and moved to intervene on behalf of Panhandle. In No. 269, the motion purported to be made in Panhandle's name. In addition to the formal parties, the City of Detroit was heard here as amicus curiae because of its interest in the supply of gas by Panhandle.\n For clarity's sake, we shall first dispose of No. 268.\n Numerous arguments were pressed upon us challenging our jurisdiction over the appeal, or, in the alternative, insisting on the propriety of the action of the district court. Treating Rule 24(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, as a comprehensive inventory of the allowable instances for intervention, it is insisted that the present case is not one for intervention as of right, and as an exercise of the district court's discretion is not reviewable here. In any event, the order of the district court is said not to be a 'final decree' within the Expediting Act, compare United States v. California Canneries, \n279 \nU.S. 553, 556\n, 49 S.Ct. 423, and on this score not reviewable. If the merits be here open, the order was correct because there was not 'timely application', as required by Rule 24(a). Finally, various considerations of controlling public interest are invoked to sustain the district court: the Attorney General is the guardian of the public interest in enforcing the anti-trust laws, compare New York City v. New York Telephone Co., \n261 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S.Ct. 372; injection of new issues ought not to be allowed to delay disposition of the main litigation, see United States v. Northern Securities Co., C.C., 128 F. 808, 813; a decree already entered should not be \n\n[312 \nU.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n impeached by intervention, see United States v. California Canneries, supra, 279 U.S. at page 556, 49 S.Ct. at page 424.\n All of these arguments misconceive the basis of the right now asserted. Its foundation is the consent decree. We are not here dealing with a conventional form of intervention, whereby an appeal is made to the court's good sense to allow persons having a common interest with the formal parties to enforce the common interest with their individual emphasis. Plainly enough, the circumstances under which interested outsiders should be allowed to become participants in a litigation is, barring very special circumstances, a matter for the nisi prius court. But where the enforcement of a public law also demands distinct safeguarding of private interests by giving them a formal status in the decree, the power to enforce rights thus sanctioned is not left to the public authorities nor put in the keeping of the district court's discretion.\n That is the present case. Panhandle's right to economic independence was at the heart of the controversy. An important aspect of that independence was the extension of its operations to permit sales in Detroit. The assurance of this extension was deemed so vital that it was safeguarded by explicit provisions in the decree. Section IV, which is in full in the margin,1 contained \n\n[312 \nU.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n those provisions, and by Section V, also set out below,2 Panhandle, 'upon proper application', could 'become a party' to the suit 'for the limited purpose of enforcing the rights conferred by Section IV'. Mokan, on behalf of Panhandle, claimed that Columbia Gas had made financial arrangements, which we need not detail, that would in practice defeat the free enterprise of Panhandle. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n We are not concerned with the substantiality of this claim. The sole question before us is whether there was standing to make the claim before the district court. We hold there was such standing. To enforce the rights conferred by Section IV was the purpose of the motion. Therefore, the codification of general doctrines of intervention contained in Rule 24(a) does not touch our problem. And since the protection afforded Panhandle by Section IV of the decree could only be secured by the remedy designed by Section V, to wit, active participation in the suit, the denial of that protection is a definitive adjudication, and so appealable. See Credits Commutation Co. v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 311, 316\n, 20 S.Ct. 636, 638; cf. Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323\n, 60 S.Ct. 540. Nor can the enforcement of this protection be deemed remotely in conflict with the public duties of the Attorney General, nor to bring in digressive issues, nor to impeach the existing decree. It is a vindication of the decree.\n A final contention in support of the order remains. It is based on two prior denials of motions by Mokan to intervene. Treating Mokan's motions as made on its own behalf on the score of its ownership of more than forty per cent of Panhandle's stock, the District Court denied the motions. Appeals from these denials were dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 108 F.2d 614, and we denied certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 687\n, 60 S.Ct. 887. The denials are now urged as res judicata. But they were a rejection of Mokan's attempt to intervene in its own behalf. In neither instance was the relief denied deemed a mode of enforcing Panhandle's rights under Sections IV and V of the decree. The earlier denials involved different legal claims from that now asserted, and, therefore are no bar to the present proceeding.\n In No. 269 Panhandle's intervention was sought by a different route. At a meeting of the stockholders of Panhandle a resolution was introduced authorizing this \n\n[312 \nU.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n proceeding. It was defeated because Columbia Oil's holding of Panhandle stock was voted against it. Mokan claimed that this stock was disqualified from being voted on a matter so deeply touching the self-interest of the Columbia companies. If this stock be not counted, so runs the argument, Mokan's votes constituted a majority and the resolution carried. But we need not pass on these problems of corporate control, because under our decision in No. 268, Panhandle's participation, derivatively asserted by Mokan, is secured.\n In a memorandum filed by the Attorney General we are advised that on January 18, 1941, the District Court filed an opinion, 36 F.Supp. 488, approving the plan for modifying the original decree subject to some suggestions by the Government. This, we are told, 'is believed to satisfy the public interest', and so the Government desires to sustain the action of the court below without further litigation. We recognize the duty of expeditious enforcement of the anti-trust laws. But expedition cannot be had at the sacrifice of rights which the original decree itself established. We assume that the district court will adjust the right which belongs to Panhandle with full regard to that public interest which underlay the original suit.\n The order in No. 268 is reversed, and that in No. 269 is affirmed. So ordered.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that both judgments should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That the defendants be and they are hereby perpetually enjoined from restraining or interfering in any manner in the freedom of Panhandle Eastern to contract or to finance or arrange the financing of all contracts, extensions (including the proposed new line to Detroit, whether or not built and owned by it), repairs, maintenance, service, or improvements necessary in its business through or with any firm, person, or corporation with whom it may choose to deal (and to that end any such financial or contractual arrangements made by Panhandle Eastern to consummate its contract dated August 31, 1935, with the Detroit City Gas Company shall be subject to the approval of the trustee who shall receive, and consider the advisability of, alternative methods of financing from any responsible under-writer);\n'That if such contracts be made with or financial assistance be secured from Columbia Gas, such contracts may be made or financial assistance furnished only upon terms or conditions which do not in any way, directly or indirectly, presently or potentially, confer upon Columbia Gas any voting rights, control or participation in the management of Panhandle Eastern or confer any rights of ownership in the works or properties of Panhandle Eastern except as security for the investment; and in the event that Columbia Gas shall, with respect to any contract or any contractual rights of any kind whatsoever or any property held as security or used in connection with any contract, in any way prevent the free transportation, sale, and distribution of gas by Panhandle Eastern, then upon application to this Court or any court of competent jurisdiction Panhandle Eastern shall have the right (1) to the immediate appointment of a trustee to hold such contract rights or property subject to the purposes and provisions of this decree; (2) to immediate specific performance of any and all contracts with Columbia Gas; and (3) to immediate injunction, both temporary and final, as well as any other appropriate remedy at law or in equity, including any remedy hereunder.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'That jurisdiction of this cause and of the parties hereto is retained for the purpose of giving full effect to this decree and for the enforcement of strict compliance herewith and the punishment of evasions hereof, and for the further purpose of making such other and further orders and decrees or taking such other action as may from time to time be necessary to the carrying out hereof; and that Panhandle Eastern, upon proper application, may become a party hereto for the limited purpose of enforcing the rights conferred by Section IV hereof.' \n\n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMITCHELL v.

Gardner and Frank Coleman, both of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, Arthur W. Mitchell, filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission alleging an unjust discrimination in the furnishing of accommodations to colored passengers on the line of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company from Chicago to Hot Springs, Arkansas, in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. The Commission dismissed the complaint (Mitchell v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. R. Co., 229 I.C.C. 703), and appellant brought this suit to set aside the Commission's order. Upon a hearing before three judges, the District Court found the facts as stated in the Commission's findings, and held that the latter were supported by substantial evidence and that \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 89]\n\u00a0\n the Commission's order was supported by its findings. The court then ruled that it was without jurisdiction, and its dismissal of the complaint was stated to be upon that ground. The case comes here on direct appeal. 28 U. S.C.  47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47a.\n The following facts were found by the Commission: Appellant, a Negro resident of Chicago, and a member of the House of Representatives of the United States, left Chicago for Hot Springs on the evening of April 20, 1937, over the lines of the Illinois Central Railroad Company to Memphis, Tennessee, and the Rock Island beyond, traveling on a round-trip ticket he had purchased at three cents per mile. He had requested a bedroom on the Chicago-Hot Springs Pullman sleeping car but none being available he was provided with a compartment as far as Memphis in the sleeper destined to New Orleans. Just before the train reached Memphis, on the morning after leaving Chicago, he had a Pullman porter transfer him to the Chicago-Hot Springs sleeper on the same train. Space was there available and the porter assigned him a particular seat in that car for which he was to pay the established fare of ninety cents. Shortly after leaving Memphis and crossing the Mississippi River into Arkansas, the train conductor took up the Memphis-Hot Springs portion of his ticket but refused to accept payment for the Pullman seat from Memphis and, in accordance with custom, compelled him over his protest and finally under threat of arrest to move into the car provided for colored passengers. This was in purported compliance with an Arkansas statute, Pope's Dig.  1190, requiring segregation of colored from white persons by the use of cars or partitioned sections providing 'equal but separate and sufficient accommodations' for both races. Later the conductor returned the portion of the ticket he had taken up and advised appellant that he could get a refund on the basis of the coach fare of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 90]\n\u00a0\n two cents per mile from Memphis. That refund was not claimed from defendants and was not sought before the Commission, but it was found that the carriers stood ready to make it upon application. Appellant has an action at law pending against defendants in Cook County, Illinois, for damages incident to his transfer.\n The Commission further found that the Pullman car contained ten sections of berths and two compartment drawing rooms; that the use of one of the drawing room would have amounted to segregation under the state law and ordinarily such combinations are available to colored passengers upon demand, the ninety cent fare being applicable. Occasionally they are used by colored passengers but in this instance both drawing rooms were already occupied by white passengers. The Pullman car was of modern design and had all the usual facilities and conveniences found in standard sleeping cars. It was air-conditioned, had hot and cold running water and separate flushable toilets for men and women. It was in excellent condition throughout. First-class white passengers had, in addition to the Pullman sleeper, the exclusive use of the train's only dining-car and only observation-parlor car, the latter having somewhat the same accommodations for day use as the Pullman car.\n The coach for colored passengers, though of standard size and steel construction, was 'an old combination affair', not air-conditioned, divided by partitions into three main parts, one for colored smokers, one for white smokers and one in the center for colored men and women, known as the women's section, in which appellant sat. There was a toilet in each section but only the one in the women's section was equipped for flushing and it was for the exclusive use of colored women. The car was without wash basins, soap, towels or running water, except in the women's section. The Commission stated that, according to appellant, the car was 'filthy \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 91]\n\u00a0\n and foul smelling', but that the testimony of defendants' witnesses was to the contrary.\n The Commission found that in July, 1937, about three months after complainant's journey above mentioned, the old combination coach was replaced by a modern, allsteel, air-conditioned coach, which was divided by a partition into two sections, one for colored and the other for white passengers, and had comfortable seats. In each section there are wash basins, running hot and cold water, and separate flush toilets for men and women. This coach, the Commission said, was 'as fully desirable in all its appointments as the coach used entirely by white passengers traveling at second-class fares'.\n The Commission also found that the demand of colored passengers for Pullman accommodations over the route in question was shown to have been negligible for many years; that 'only about 1 negro to 20 white passengers rides this train from and to points on the line between Memphis and Hot Springs', and there is hardly ever a demand from a colored passenger for Pullman accommodations. The conductor estimated that this demand did not amount to one per year. What demand there may have been at ticket offices did not appear.\n The Commission's conclusion was thus stated: 'The present coach properly takes care of colored second-class passengers, and the drawing rooms and compartments in the sleeper provide proper Pullman accommodations for colored first-class passengers, but there are no dining- car nor observation-parlor car accommodations for the latter, and they cannot lawfully range through the train'.\n The Commission, though treating the enforcement of the state law as a matter for state authorities, thought that in deciding the case on the facts presented it must recognize that the state law required the defendants \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 92]\n\u00a0\n to segregate colored passengers; that in these circumstances the present colored-passenger coach and the Pullman drawing rooms met the requirements of the Act; and that as there was comparatively little colored traffic and no indication that there was likely to be such demand for dining-car and observation-parlor car accommodations by colored passengers as to warrant the running of any extra cars or the construction of partitions, the discrimination and prejudice was 'plainly not unjust or undue'. The Commission observed that it was only differences in treatment of the latter character that were 'unlawful and within the power of this Commission to condemn, remove, and prevent'.\n From the dismissal of the complaint, five Commiss oners dissented.\n The United States as a party to this suit to set aside the Commissioner's order, and one of the appellees, does not support the judgment of the court below and has filed a memorandum stating its reasons. The Government concludes that the Commission erroneously supposed that the Arkansas Separate Coach Law applied to an interstate passenger and erroneously determined that the small number of colored passengers asking for first-class accommodations justified an occasional discrimination against them because of their race.\n The other appellees-the Interstate Commerce Commission and the carriers-appear in support of the judgment.\n First.-The Commission challenges the standing of appellant to bring this suit. We find the objection untenable. This question does not touch the merits of the suit, but merely the authority of the District Court to entertain it. The fact that the Commission's order was one of dismissal of appellant's complaint did not foreclose the right of review. Appellant was an aggrieved party and the negative form of the order is not control- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 93]\n\u00a0\n ling. Rochester Telephone Corporation v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 143\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, 763\n\n\n Nor is it determinative that it does not appear that appellant intends to make a similar railroad journey. He is an American citizen free to travel, and he is entitled to go by this particular route whenever he chooses to take it and in that event to have facilities for his journey without any discrimination against him which the Interstate Commerce Act forbids. He presents the question whether the Act does forbid the conduct of which he complains.\n The question of appellant's right to seek review of the Commission's order thus involves the primary question of administrative authority, that is, whether appellant took an appropriate course in seeking a ruling of the Commission. The established function of the Commission gives the answer. The determination whether a discrimination by an interstate carrier is unjust and unlawful necessitates an inquiry into particular facts and the practice of the carrier in a particular relation, and this underlying inquiry is precisely that which the Commission is authorized to make. As to the duty to seek a determination by the Commission in such a case, we do not see that a passenger would be in any better situation than a shipper. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075; Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 506\n, 32 S.Ct. 114; Mitchell Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R.

El Dorado Terminal Co., \n308 \nU.S. 422\n, 60 S.Ct. 325.\n The District Court had jurisdiction to review the action of the Commission and the question on that review was whether that action was in accordance with the applicable law.\n Second.-The case was submitted to the District Court upon the evidence taken before the Commission. The \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 94]\n\u00a0\n undisputed facts showed conclusively that, having paid a first-class fare for the entire journey from Chicago to Hot Springs, and having offered to pay the proper charge for a seat which was available in the Pullman car for the trip from Memphis to Hot Springs, he was compelled, in accordance with custom, to leave that car and to ride in a second-class car and was thus denied the standard conveniences and privileges afforded to first- class passengers. This was manifestly a discrimination against him in the course of his interstate journey and admittedly that discrimination was based solely upon the fact that he was a Negro. The question whether this was a discrimination forbidden by the Interstate Commerce Act is not a question of segregation1 but one of equality of treatment. The denial to appellant of equality of accommodations because of his race would e an invasion of a fundamental individual right which is guaranteed against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment (McCabe v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Rwy. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 151\n, 160-162, 35 S.Ct. 69, 70, 71; Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, \n305 \nU.S. 337, 344\n, 345 S., 59 S.Ct. 232, 234) and in view of the nature of the right and of our constitutional policy it cannot be maintained that the discrimination as it was alleged was not essentially unjust. In that aspect it could not be deemed to lie outside the purview of the sweeping prohibitions of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n We have repeatedly said that it is apparent from the legislative history of the Act that not only was the evil of discrimination the principal thing aimed at, but that there is no basis for the contention that Congress intended to exempt any discriminatory action or practice of interstate carriers affecting interstate commerce which it had authority to reach. The Shreveport Case, 234 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 95]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 342, 356, 34 S.Ct. 833, 838; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740, 749\n, 750 S., 51 S.Ct. 297, 300, 301; Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 512\n, 513 S., 51 S.Ct. 505, 509. Paragraph 1 of Section 3 of the Act says explicitly that it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the Act 'to subject any particular person ... to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever'. 49 U.S.C.  3, 49 U. S.C.A.  3. From the inception of its administration the Interstate Commerce Commission has recognized the applicability of this provision to discrimination against colored passengers because of their race and the duty of carriers to provide equality of treatment with respect to transportation facilities; that is, that colored persons who buy first- class tickets must be furnished with accommodations equal in comforts and conveniences to those afforded to first-class white passengers. See Council v. Western & Atlantic R.R. Co., 1 I.C.C. 339; Heard v. Georgia R.R. Co., 1 I.C.C. 428; Heard v. Georgia R.R. Co., 3 I.C.C. 111; Edwards v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Rwy. Co., 12 I.C.C. 247; Cozart v. Southern Rwy. Co ., 16 I.C.C. 226; Gaines v. Seaboard Air Line Rwy. Co., 16 I.C.C. 471; Crosby v. St. Louis-San Francisco Rwy. Co., 112 I.C.C. 239.2\n Third.-We find no sound reason for the failure to apply this principle by holding the discrimination from which the appellant suffered to be unlawful and by forbidding it in the future. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 96]\n\u00a0\n That there was but a single incident was not a justification of the treatment of the appellant. Moreover, the Commission thought it plain that 'the incident was mentioned as representative of an alleged practice that was expected to continue'. And the Commission found that the ejection of appellant from the Pullman car and the requirement that he should continue his journey in a second-class car was 'in accordance with custom', that is, as we understand it, according to the custom which obtained in similar circumstances.\n Nor does the change in the carrier's practice avail. That did not alter the discrimination to which appellant had been subjected, and as to the future the change was not adequate. It appears that since July, 1937, the carrier had put in service a coach for colored passengers which is of equal quality with that used by second-class white passengers. But, as the Government well observes, the question does not end with travel on second- class tickets. It does not appear that colored passengers who have bought first-class tickets for transportation by the carrier are given accommodations which are substantially equal to those afforded to white passengers. The Government puts the matter succinctly: 'When a drawing room is available, the carrier practice of allowing colored passengers to use one at Pullman seat rates avoids inequality as between the accommodations specifically assigned to the passenger. But when none is available, as on the trip which occasioned this litigation, the discrimination and inequality of accommodation become self-evident. It is no answer to say that the colored passengers, if sufficiently diligent and forehanded, can make their reservations so far in advance as to be assured of first-class accommodations. So long as white passengers can secure first-class reservations on the day of travel and the colored passengers cannot, the latter are subjected to inequality and discrimination because \n\n[313 \nU.S. 80, 97]\n\u00a0\n of their race'. And the Commission has recognized that inequality persists with respect to certain other facilities such as dining-car and observation-parlor car accommodations.\n We take it that the chief reason for the Commission's action was the 'comparatively little colored traffic'. But the comparative volume of traffic cannot justify the denial of a fundamental right of equality of treatment, a right specifically safeguarded by the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. We thought a similar argument with respect to volume of traffic to be untenable in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. We said that it made the constitutional right depend upon the number of persons who may be discriminated against, whereas the essence of that right is that it is a personal one. McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Rwy. Co., supra. While the supply of particular facilities may be conditioned upon there being a reasonable demand therefor, if facilities are provided, substantial equality of treatment of persons traveling under like conditions cannot be refused. It is the individual, we said, who is entitled to the equal protection of the laws,-not merely a group of individuals, or a body of persons according to their numbers. Id. See, also Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. pages 350, 351, 59 S.Ct. 236, 237. And the Interstate Commerce Act expressly extends its prohibitions to the subjecting of 'any particular person' to unreasonable discriminations.\n On the facts here presented, there is no room, as the Government properly says, for administrative or expert judgment with respect to practical difficulties. It is enough that the discrimination shown was palpably unjust and forbidden by the Act.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to set aside the order of the Commission and to remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded with directions. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In this view, we have no occasion to consider the questions discussed by the Attorneys General of several States in their briefs as amici curiae. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In Edwards v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Rwy. Co., 12 I.C.C. 247, 249, the principle was thus stated: 'If a railroad provides certain facilities and accommodations for first-class passengers of the white race, it is commanded by the law that like accommodations shall be provided for colored passengers of the same class. The principle that must govern is that carriers must serve equally well all passengers, whether white or colored, paying the same fare. Failure to do this is discrimination and subjects the passenger to 'undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage\". \n\n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v. ILLINOIS CENT. R. CO.(1941)\nNo. 550\nArgued: Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 630, 631]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Butler and Garner W. Green, both of Jackson, Miss., for petitioner.\n Mr. James L. Byrd, of Jackson, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We granted certiorari in this case, \n311 \nU.S. 643\n, 61 S.Ct. 392, 85 L. Ed. --, to review a judgment in which the Circuit Court of Appeals applied a Mississippi statute of limitations contrary to the Mississippi Supreme Court's application of the same statute to the same plea in the same case. Compare Moore v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., 180 Miss. 276, 277, 176 So. 593, with Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Moore, 5 Cir., 112 F.2d 959. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 630, 632]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner Moore, a member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, brought suit for damages against respondent railroad company in a Mississippi state court, claiming that he had been wrongfully discharged contrary to the terms of a contract between the Trainmen and the railroad, a copy of the contract being attached to the complaint as an exhibit. Petitioner alleged that as a member of the Trainmen he was entitled to all the benefits of the contract. Judgment on the pleadings was rendered against Moore by the trial court. Upon appeal the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed and remanded. One of the railroad's pleas was that the contract of employment between Moore and the railroad was verbal, rather than written, and that any action thereon was therefore barred by the three-year statute of limitations provided by Section 2299 of the Mississippi Code of 1930. With reference to this plea the Mississippi Supreme Court said: 'The appellant's suit is not on a verbal contract between him and the appellee, but on a written contract made with the appellee, for appellant's benefit, by the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen; consequently, section 2299, Code of 1930, has no application, and the time within which the appellant could sue is six years under section 2292, Code of 1930.' Moore v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., supra, 180 Miss. 291, 176 So. 596.\n After the remand by the Mississippi Supreme Court, Moore amended his bill to ask damages in excess of $3,000, and the railroad removed the case to the federal courts. The District Court, considering itself bound by state law, held that the Mississippi three-year statute of limitations did not apply,1 but on this point the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,2 declining to follow the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 630, 633]\n\u00a0\n Mississippi Supreme Court's ruling. Calling attention to the fact that the Mississippi Supreme Court does not regard itself as bound by a decision upon a second appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting) said: 'Since the removal of the case to the federal court this court stands in the place of the Supreme Court of Mississippi and with the same power of reconsideration.' But the Circuit Courts of Appeals do not have the same power to reconsider interpretations of state law by state courts as do the highest courts of the state in which a decision has been rendered. The Mississippi Supreme Court had the power to reconsider and overrule its former interpretation, but the court below did not. And in the absence of a change by the Mississippi Legislature, the court below could reconsider and depart from the ruling of the highest court of Mississippi on Mississippi's statute of limitations only to the extent, if any, that examination of the later opinions of the Mississippi Supreme Court showed that it had changed its earlier interpretation of the effect of the Mississippi statute. Wichita Royalty Co. v. City National Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 59 S.Ct. 420, 421; cf. West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n311 \nU.S. 223\n, 61 S.Ct. 179; Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Field, \n311 \nU.S. 169\n, 61 S.Ct. 176. But the court below did not rely upon any change brought about by the Mississippi Legislature or the Mississippi Supreme Court. On the contrary, it concluded that it should re-examine the law because there was involved the interpretation and application of a collective contract of an interstate railroad with its employees. The court below also based its failure to follow the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in Moore's case on the ground that in an earlier case the Mississippi Supreme Court had said that the three-year statute applied unless a contract was 'provable wholly by writing,' a situation which the court below did not think existed \n\n[312 \nU.S. 630, 634]\n\u00a0\n here. \n3\n But even before the decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, the federal courts applied state statutes of limitations in accordance with the interpretations given to such statutes by the states' highest courts. As early as 1893, this court said: 'The construction given to a statute (of limitations) of a state by the highest judicial tribunal of such state is regarded as a part of the statute, and is as binding upon the courts of the United States as the text. If the highest judicial tribunal of a state adopt new views as to the proper construction of such a statute, and reverse its former decisions, this court will follow the latest settled adjudications.' 4 It was error for the court below to depart from the Mississippi Supreme Court's interpretation of the state statute of limitations.\n But respondent says that there is another reason why the judgment in its favor should be sustained. \n5\n This reason, according to respondent, is that both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in failing to hold that Moore's suit was prematurely brought because of his failure to exhaust the administrative remedies granted him by the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C.  151 et seq ., 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. But we find nothing in that Act which purports to take away from the courts the jurisdiction to determine a controversy over a wrongful discharge or to make an administrative finding a prerequisite to filing a suit in court. In support of its contention, the railroad points especially to section 153(i), which, as amended in 1934, pro- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 630, 635]\n\u00a0\n vides that disputes growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements 'shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of the Adjustment Board with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.' And in connection with this statutory language the railroad also directs our attention to a provision in the agreement between the Trainmen and the railroad-a provision authorizing Moore to submit his complaint to officials of the railroad, offer witnesses before them, appeal to higher officers of the company in case the decision should be unsatisfactory, and obtain reinstatement and pay for time lost if officials of the railroad should find that his suspension or dismissal was unjust. It is to be noted that the section pointed out,  153(i), as amended in 1934, provides no more than that disputes 'may be referred ... to the ... Adjustment Board ....' It is significant that the comparable section of the 1926 Railway Labor Act (44 Stat. 577, 578), had, before the 1934 amendment, provided that upon failure of the parties to reach an adjustment a 'dispute shall be referred to the designated adjustment board by the parties, or by either party ....' Section 3(c). This difference in language, substituting 'may' for 'shall', was not, we think, an indication of a change in policy, but was instead a clarification of the law's original purpose. For neither the original 1926 Act, nor the Act as amended in 1934, indicates that the machinery provided for settling disputes was based on a philosophy of legal compulsion. On the contrary, the legislative history of the Railway Labor Act shows a consistent purpose on the part of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 630, 636]\n\u00a0\n Congress to establish and maintain a system for peaceful adjustment and mediation voluntary in its nature. \n6\n The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals properly decided that petitioner was not required by the Railway Labor Act to seek adjustment of his controversy with the railroad as a prerequisite to suit for wrongful discharge. But for failure to follow state law on the state statute of limitations, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; the judgment of the District Court is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and judgment of the District Court affirmed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24 F.Supp. 731. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 5 Cir., 112 F.2d 959, 964. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] City of Hattiesburg v.

William Earle White, of Petersburg, Va., and Paul E. Hadlick, of Washington, D.C., for respondent Independent Organization of Employees of the Virginia Electric & Power Co.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon the usual proceedings1 had pursuant to section 10 of the National Labor Relations Act2, 29 U.S.C.A.  160, the Board made substantially the following findings of fact:\n For years prior to the events in this case the Virginia Electric and Power Company (hereinafter called the Com- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n pany) was hostile to labor organizations. From 1922, when a strike was unsuccessful by a nationally affiliated union, 3 until the formation of the Independent Organization of Employees (hereinafter called the Independent) in 1937 there was no labor organization among its employees. Shortly after the enactment of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933, 48 Stat. 195, Holtzclaw, the president of the Company, spoke to the employees and stated that any organization among them was 'entirely unnecessary'. Until his death in May 1937 the Company utilized the services of one Walters, an employee of the Railway Audit and Inspection Company who prior to the effective date of the Act admittedly furnished a report on the labor activity of the employees to the Company. In 1936 Bishop, Superintendent of Transportation in Norfolk, interrogated employees concerning union activities. On April 26, 1937, shortly after the Act was upheld,4 and an A.F. of L. organizer had appeared, the Company posted a bulletin5 throughout its operations appealing to the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n employees to bargain with the Company directly without the intervention of an 'outside' union, and thereby coerced its employees. In response to this bulletin several requests for increased wages and better working conditions were received. \n6\n The Company decided to withhold action on those requests and directed its employees to select representatives to attend meetings at which Company officials would speak on the Wagner Act. These represen- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n tatives met in Norfolk and Richmond on May 24 and were addressed by high Company officials who read identical speeches7 stressing the desirability of forming a bargain-\n___ 7 'A substantial number of its employees representing various departments and various occupations have approached the Company with the request that the Company consider with them the matter of their working conditions and wages. In other words, they have requested collective bargaining. The Company's position with respect to this was recently stated in a posted bulletin.\n'In a company such as ours, if an individual operator, for example, should ask for himself better working conditions or wages, this Company could not comply with his request without also making the same concessions to other similar operators. In such a case the operator who appealed individually would, as a practical matter, be bargaining collectively for all of his group, which is not the logical procedure.\n\n'This Company is willing to consider the requests mentioned above but feels that, in fairness to all of its employees and to itself, it should at the same time consider other groups who have not yet come to it. If the approaching negotiations are to be intelligent and fair to all properly concerned, they should be conducted in an orderly way, and all interested groups should be represented in these discussions by representatives of their own choosing, as provided in the Wagner National Labor Relations Act, which provides as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 7. ( 157.) Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.' (29 U.S.C.A.  157).\n\n'The Wagner Act applies only to employees whose work is in or directly affects interstate commerce and to companies engaged in interstate commerce. Counsel for this Company advise us that in their opinion the provisions of the Act do not apply to local transportation employees, to gas employees in Norfolk, or to certain strictly local employees of the light and power department. In spite of this, the Company wants to make it perfectly clear that its policy is one of willingness to bargain with its employees in any manner satisfactory to the majority of its employees and that no employee will be discriminated against because of any labor affiliations he desires to make. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n ing agency. At the Richmond meeting it was announced that any wage increase granted would be retroactive to June 1. By the substance of the speeches and the mechanics of the meetings the Company gave impetus to and assured the creation of an 'inside' organization and coerced its employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by section 7 of the Act. Meetings, arranged with the cooperation of Company supervisors, on Company property and, in some instances on Company time, followed, at which the May 24 speeches were reported to the men who voted to form an 'inside' organization and selected committees for that purpose. These committees met on Company property until June 15 when the constitution of the Independent was adopted.\n\n While the Independent was in the process of organization, Edwards, a supervisor, kept meetings of a rival C.I.O. union under surveillance and warned employees that they would be discharged for 'messing with the C.I.O.' On June 1 Mann, a member of the C.I.O. who had openly protested against an 'inside' union at one of the May 11 meetings (see note 6 ante) attended by Superintendent Bishop's son, Warren, was discharged for union activities. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n On June 17 application cards for the Independent were distributed throughout the entire system of the Company and many were signed on Company property and time. Within three weeks after the adoption of the constitution of the Independent a majority of the employees filled out application cards. By July 13 the organization was complete and permanent committeemen had been elected. A majority of those committeemen had been present at the May 24 meetings. On July 19 the Independent notified the Company that it represented a majority of the employees and submitted a proposed contract. Negotiations were begun on July 30 and agreement was reached by midnight of the following day. The contract was formally executed on August 5, and provided, inter alia, for a closed shop, a check- off, and a wage increase. On August 20 the Company paid $3,784.50 to the Independent although it had not yet deducted that entire amount from the employees' wages. On November 4, the date upon which the closed shop provision became effective, the Company discharged two employees, Staunton and Elliott, because they refused to join the Independent. In March, 1938, it discharged another employee, Harrell, for his membership and activity in an outside union.\n Upon the basis of these findings and the entire record in the case the Board concluded that the Company had committed unfair labor practices within the meaning of section 8(1), (2) and (3) of the Act. Its order directed the Company to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices and from giving effect to its contract with the Independent, to withdraw recognition from and disestablish that organization, to reinstate with back pay the four wrongfully discharged employees, to reimburse each of its employees who was a member of the Independent in the amount of the dues and assessments checked off his wages by the Company on behalf of the Independent, and to post appropriate notices. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n The Company and the Independent filed separate petitions in the court below to review and set aside the Board's order. The Board answered and requested enforcement of its order against the Company. The court below denied enforcement to any part of the Board's order, completely setting it aside. \n8\n We granted the petition for writs of certiorari because the case was thought to present important questions in the administration of the Act. \n312 \nU.S. 677\n, 61 S.Ct. 826\n\n\n The Company is engaged in the business of generating and distributing electrical energy in eastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. It also furnishes illuminating gas to customers in the vicinity of Norfolk, Virginia, and operates transportation services in Richmond, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Petersburg. It does not here renew the contention, correctly decided against it by the court below,9 that the jurisdiction of the Board does not extend to its employees in the gas and transportation departments.\n The command of section 10(e) of the Act that 'the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive' precludes an independent consideration of the facts. Bearing this in mind we must ever guard against allowing our views to be substituted for those of the agency which Congress has created to administer the Act. But here the Board's conclusion that the Independent was a Company dominated union seems based heavily upon findings which are not free from ambiguity and doubt. We believe that the Board, and not this Court, should undertake the task of clarification.\n The Board specifically found that the bulletin of April 26 and the speeches of May 24 'interfered with, re- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n strained and coerced' the Company's employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by section 7 of the Act. The Company strongly urges that such a finding is repugnant to the First Amendment. Neither the Act nor the Board's order here enjoins the employer from expressing its view on labor policies or problems, nor is a penalty imposed upon it because of any utterances which it has made. The sanctions of the Act are imposed not in punishment of the employer but for the protection of the employees. The employer in this case is as free now as ever to take any side it may choose on this controversial issue. But certainly conduct, though evidenced in part by speech, may amount in connection with other circumstances to coercion within the meaning of the Act. If the total activities of an employer restrain or coerce his employees in their free choice, then those employees are entitled to the protection of the Act. And in determining whether a course of conduct amounts to restraint or coercion, pressure exerted vocally by the employer may no more be disregarded than pressure exerted in other ways. For 'Slight suggestions as to the employer's choice between unions may have telling effect among men who know the consequences of incurring that employer's strong displeasure.' International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72, 78\n, 61 S.Ct. 83, 87, 88.\n If the Board's order here may fairly be said to be based on the totality of the Company's activities during the period in question, we may not consider the findings of the Board as to the coercive effect of the bulletin and the speeches in isolation from the findings as respects the other conduct of the Company. If the Board's ultimate conclusion is based upon a complex of activities, such as the anti-union background of the Company, the activities of Bishop, Edwards' warning to the employees that they would be discharged for 'messing with the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 478]\n\u00a0\n C.I.O.', the discharge of Mann, the quick formation of the Independent, and the part which the management may have played in that formation, that conclusion would not be vitiated by the fact that the Board considered what the Company said in conjunction with what it did. The mere fact that language merges into a course of conduct does not put that whole course without the range of otherwise applicable administrative power. In determining whether the Company actually interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees the Board has a right to look at what the Company has said as well as what it has done.\n But from the Board's decision we are far from clear that the Board here considered the whole complex of activities, of which the bulletin and the speeches are but parts, in reaching its ultimate conclusion with regard to the Independent. The Board regarded the bulletin on its face as showing a marked bias against national unions by implying that strikes and unrest are caused by the organizational campaigns of such bodies, by stressing the 'happy relationship of mutual confidence and understanding' prevailing in the absence of organization since the defeat of the Amalgamated in 1922, and by emphasizing the negative 'right' of the employees to refrain from exercising their rights guaranteed under the Act after paying 'lip service' to those rights. Summing up its conclusions the Board said: 'We interpret the bulletin as an appeal to the employees to bargain with the respondent directly, without the intervention of any 'outside' union. We find that by posting the bulletin the respondent interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.'\n The Board was of the view that the speeches delivered in the meetings of May 24 provided the impetus for the formation of a system-wide organization, that they re- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 479]\n\u00a0\n emphasized the Company's distaste for 'outside' organizations by referring to the bulletin, and that, after quoting the provision of the Act forbidding employer domination of labor organizations, they suggested that the employees select their 'own' officers, and adopt their 'own' by-laws and rules. The Board's finding was: 'We find that at the May 24 meetings the respondent urged its employees to organize and to do so independently of 'outside' assistance, and that it thereby interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.'\n It is clear that the Board specifically found that those utterances were unfair labor practices, and it does not appear that the Board raised them to the stature of coercion by reliance on the surrounding circumstances. If the utterances are thus to be separated from their background, we find it difficult to sustain a finding of coercion with respect to them alone. The bulletin and the speeches set forth the right of the employees to do as they please without fear of retaliation by the Company. Perhaps the purport of these utterances may be altered by imponderable subtleties at work which it is not our function to appraise. Whether there are sufficient findings and evidence of interference, restraint, coercion, and domination without reference to the bulletin and the speeches, or whether the whole course of conduct evidenced in part by the utterances was aimed at achieving objectives forbidden by the Act, are questions for the Board to decide upon the evidence.\n Here we are not sufficiently certain from the findings that the Board based its conclusion with regard to the Independent upon the whole course of conduct revealed by this record. Rather it appears that the Board rested heavily upon findings with regard to the bulletin and the speeches the adequacy of which we regard as doubtful. We therefore remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals with directions to remand it to the Board for a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 469, 480]\n\u00a0\n redetermination of the issues in the light of this opinion. We do not mean to intimate any views of our own as to whether the Independent was dominated or suggest to the Board what its conclusion should be when it reconsiders the case. Since the Board rested the remainder of its order in large part on its findings with respect to the domination of the Independent, we do not at this time reach the other parts of the Board's order, including the command that the checked-off dues and assessments should be refunded.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These proceedings were instituted on charges and amended charges filed in 1937 and 1938 by the Transport Workers Union of America, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, by the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electrical Railway, and Motor Coach Employees of America, and by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the latter two being affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.

Such campaigns are now being pressed in various industries and in different parts of the country and strikes and unrest have developed in many localities. For the last fifteen years this company and its employees have enjoyed a happy relationship of mutual confidence and understanding with each other, and during this period there has not been any labor organization among our employees in any department, so far as the management is aware. Under these circumstances, we feel that our employees are entitled to know certain facts and have a statement as to the Company's attitude with reference to this matter.\n\n'The Company recognizes the right of every employee to join any union that he may wish to join, and such membership will not affect his position with the company. On the other hand, we feel that it should be made equally clear to each employee that it is not at all necessary for him to join any labor organization, despite anything he may be told to the contrary. Certainly, there is no law which requires or is intended to compel you to pay dues to, or to join any organization. \n\n'This company has always dealt with its employees in full recognition of the right of every individual employee, or group of employees, to deal directly with the Company with respect to matters affecting their interests. If any of you, individually or as a group, at any time, have any matter which you wish to discuss with us, any officer or department head will be glad, as they always have been, to meet with you and discuss them frankly and fully. It is our earnest desire to straighten out in a friendly manner, as we have done in the past, whatever questions you may have in mind. It is reasonable to believe that our interests are mutual and can best be promoted through confidence and cooperation.\n\n'(signed) J. G.

R. Ruett, a car operator. Both Ruett, and R. E. Elliott, who assumed the leadership in those meetings, testified that Superintendent Bishop had urged them to form an inside organization after warning them against the C.I.O. Bishop denied this, and the Board made no finding. \n'The petitions and representations already received indicate a desire on the part of these employees at least to do their own bargaining, and we are taking this means of letting you know our willingness to proceed with such bargaining in an orderly manner. In order to progress, it would seem that the first step necessary to be taken by you is the formation of a bargaining agency and the selection of authorized representatives to conduct this bargaining in such an orderly manner.\n\n'The Wagner Labor Act prohibits a company from 'dominating or interfering with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute (sic) financial or other support to it.'\n\n'In view of your request to bargain directly with the Company and, in view of your right to self-organization as provided in the law, it will facilitate negotiations if you will proceed to set up your organization, select your own officers and adviser, adopt your own by-laws and rules, and select your representatives to meet with the Company officials whenever you desire.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Virginia Electric & Power Co. v.

EXPRESS PUB. CO.(1941)\nNo. 442\nArgued: February 14, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Laurence A. Knapp, of Washington, D.C., and Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Leroy G. Denman, of San Antonio, Tex., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Labor Relations Board ordered respondent affirmatively to bargain collectively with the San Antonio Newspaper Guild, the authorized representative of respondent's employees. In addition it ordered respondent, (1) to 'cease and desist' from refusing to bargain collectively with the Guild; (2) to 'cease and desist' from interfering with, restraining or coercing its employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization', and other rights guaranteed by  7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.Supp.V,  151 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.; (3) to post notices stating, among other things, that respondent will 'cease and desist as aforesaid' and will bargain collectively with the organized representative of its employees. On the record before us the question for our decision is whether the provisions of the order which we have enumerated are supported by the Board's finding that the respondent had refused to bargain collectively with the authorized representative of its employees, and had interfered with such bargaining negotiation, and had thereby interfered with the exercise of the rights guaranteed by  7 of the Act.\n The Board issued its complaint charging respondent, a publisher of a newspaper, with refusal to bargain collectively with the Guild as the authorized representative of the employees in respondent's editorial department, and that by such refusal and by statements made by respondent at a meeting of those employees it 'did interfere with, restrain and coerce' its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by  7 of the Act1 and did \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n engage in unfair labor practices defined by  8(1) and 8(5). The usual proceedings and hearings before the Board resulted in findings by the Board to the effect that although respondent had throughout recognized the organization of respondent's editorial room employees and the Guild as their representative, and had met with the Guild representatives whenever requested for the purpose of discussing the employees' demands, it nevertheless had persistently refused to discuss in detail the proposals of the Guild, to make any counter proposals or to enter into any agreement with it, and had not negotiated in good faith in a genuine effort to compose the differences between employer and employees.\n The Board found that respondent had refused to bargain as required by  8(5) of the Act. It found that respondent had made the statements charged in the complaint at a meeting of its employees and that these statements were an 'interference with the Guild's efforts to negotiate'. Treating respondent's action in refusing to bargain and in interfering with the bargaining negotiations as an infringement of all the rights guaranteed to the employees by the Act, it found broadly, in the words of the statute, a violation of  8(1) which declares that it is an unfair labor practice for the employer 'to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in  7 (section 157 of this title)'. Section 7 provides: 'Employees shall have the right to self- organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.' \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n From all this the Board concluded that the 'appropriate remedy' was an order directing respondent 'upon request to bargain collectively with the ... Guild' as the 'exclusive representative' of respondent's editorial room employees and 'if understandings are reached to embody such understandings in a signed agreement if requested to do so by the Guild.' Having provided the recommended remedy by the provisions of its order directing the respondent to bargain and to cease and desist from refusing to bargain the Board went further and ordered broadly that respondent should in effect refrain from violating the Act in any manner whatsoever. This it did by paragraph 1(b) of the order which directed respondent to cease and desist from\n'In any manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for the purposes of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection, as guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.'\n\n It is this and the provisions of the order other than that part of it directing respondent to bargain which are the subjects of the present controversy.\n Upon petition of the Board to enforce the order, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck from it all the provisions except that which directed respondent to bargain with the Guild on request, and to embody any understanding in a signed agreement. For so much of the order as directed the posting of notices the court substituted a requirement that respondent notify the Guild of its willingness to comply with the order as modified and to notify a specified agent of the Board what steps respondent had taken to comply with the order. 111 F.2d 588. We granted certiorari November 12, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 638\n, 61 S.Ct. 134, 85 L.Ed. --, the ques- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n tions raised being of importance in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act.\n Although respondent has not sought certiorari it seeks to retain such advantages as it may have gained from the modification of the Board's order below, by arguing broadly that the Board's finding of respondent's refusal to bargain is without support in the evidence, which it is said shows only that respondent refused to yield to the Guild demands as it was free to do. But in the absence of a cross-petition for certiorari by respondent that question is not open here. Without the findings relating to respondent's refusal to bargain there was no basis for any order by the Board and we think that the purpose and effect of the judgment sustaining so much of the Board's order as directed that respondent bargain with the Guild was to sustain the findings on which it was based. This appears both from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, the purport of which is that respondent in its negotiations with the Guild had not acted in good faith and so had failed to bargain as the statute requires, and also from the terms of the judgment modifying the Board's order. The judgment affirming the Board's order as modified retained, as the foundation of the judgment, the recital contained in the Board's original order that it was made upon the basis of all the Board's findings. In this state of the record our review is limited to the sufficiency of the Board's findings to support the order.\n We conclude also that it is not open to respondent to challenge the judgment below, as it attempts to do, on the ground that the Board's complaint in charging a failure to bargain did not sufficiently inform respondent of the contention that it had failed to bargain in good faith. This is the case both because respondent has sought no review of the judgment below and because it sufficiently appears from the record that in the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n course of the hearings before the Board respondent was fully advised of the nature of the Board's contention.\n But it is the Board which has brought the judgment below here for review and on it rests the burden of showing in what respects the judgment is erroneous. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Beech Nut Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441\n, 42 S.Ct. 150, 19 A.L.R. 882. To sustain that burden the Board insists that all the provisions of its order were lawfully made and that it is entitled to have the order enforced in its entirety. Section 10( c) of the Act provides that if the Board 'upon all the testimony taken ... shall be of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter).' The Board, having found in this case that respondent had refused to bargain, that part of its order directing respondent to 'cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively' with the Guild, was in exact compliance with the statute and should have been left undisturbed by the judgment below.\n A question of a different nature is presented by Paragraph 1(b) of the order by which the Board, on the basis of respondent's action in refusing to bargain and its statements interfering with the bargaining negotiations, has directed respondent not to violate 'in any manner' the duties imposed on the employer by the statute. Petitioner argues that since respondent's refusal to bargain, which is a violation of  8(5), is also a violation of  8(1) which in terms incorporates by reference all the rights enumerated in  7, the Board is not only free to restrain violations like those which respondent has committed, but any other unfair labor \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n practices of any kind which likewise infringe any of the rights enumerated in  7, however unrelated those practices may be to the acts of respondent which alone emerged in course of the hearing and which the Board has found.\n But we think it does not follow that, because the acts of respondent which the Board has found to be an unfair labor practice defined by  8(5) are also a technical violation of  8(1), the Board, in the circumstances of this case, is justified in making a blanket order restraining the employer from committing any act in violation of the statute, however unrelated it may be to those charged and found, or that courts are required for the indefinite future to give effect in contempt proceedings to an order of such breadth.\n We cannot find such authority or requirement in the carefully chosen language of  10(c), which directs the Board to state its findings of fact showing the unfair labor practice charged and to order the person accused to 'cease and desist from such unfair labor practice', or in  10(e) of the Act which authorizes the court on application of the Board to enter a 'decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board.' It is obvious that the order of the Board, which when judicially confirmed, the courts may be called on to enforce by contempt proceedings, must, like the injunction order of a court, state with reasonable specificity the acts which the respondent is to do or refrain from doing. It would seem equally clear that the authority conferred on the Board to restrain the practice which it has found the employer to have committed is not an authority to restrain generally all other unlawful practices which it has neither found to have been pursued not persuasively to be related to the proven unlawful conduct. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n Congress has itself afforded a guide pointing to the appropriate limits of the order which the Board is to make in restraining unfair labor practices. By its definition and classification of unfair labor practices in the statute it has shown that they are not always so similar or related that the commission of one necessarily merits or rightly admits of an order restraining all. Here the whole controversy between respondent and the Guild was with respect to the Guild's requests to bargain and respondent's attempt to influence the negotiations and its ultimate refusal to enter into an agreement from all of which the Board inferred the refusal to bargain in good faith. In all other respects respondent has consistently left the Guild and its activities undisturbed. The Board made no finding and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the failure of the bargaining negotiations and all that attended them gave any indication that in the future respondent would engage in all or any of the numerous other unfair labor practices defined by the Act.\n Refusal to bargain, defined as an unfair labor practice by  8(5), may be, as we think it was here, wholly unrelated to the domination of a labor union or the interference with its formation or administration or financial or other support to it, all of which are defined as unfair labor practices by  8(2). Refusal to bargain may be, as we think it was here, wholly unrelated to 'discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization,' all of which are unfair labor practices as defined by  8(3). Here the Board made no finding, based either on the specific circumstances disclosed by the record or on its own expert judgment of their relation to the policy embodied in  7, or as to any relationship or probable relationship of respondent's refusal to bargain and the other types of unfair practices some of which are enumer- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n ated in  8. Yet, if the contention which it makes is to be sustained subsequent violations of  8(2) and (3), which are also violations of  8( 1) may be the subject of a contempt order merely because respondent by the refusal to bargain has violated  8(5) which is similarly a violation of  8(1).\n In view of the authority given to the Board by  10(c), carefully restricted to the restraint of such unfair labor practices as the Board has found the employer to have committed, and of the broad language of  10(e) authorizing the courts to modify the order of the Board wholly or in part, we can hardly suppose that Congress intended that the Board should make or the court should enforce orders which could not appropriately be made in judicial proceedings. This is the more so because  10(a), which authorizes the Board 'as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice', specifically directs that 'This power shall be exclusive, and shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise'. In the light of these provisions we think that Congress did not contemplate that the courts should, by contempt proceedings, try alleged violations of the National Labor Relations Act not in controversy and not found by the Board and which are not similar or fairly related to the unfair labor practice which the Board has found.\n A federal court has broad power to restrain acts which are of the same type or class as unlawful acts which the court has found to have been committed or whose commission in the future unless enjoined, may fairly be anticipated from the defendant's conduct in the past. But the mere fact that a court has found that a defendant has committed an act in violation of a statute does not justify an injunction broadly to obey the statute and thus subject the defendant to contempt proceedings if \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 436]\n\u00a0\n he shall at any time in the future commit some new violation unlike and unrelated to that with which he was originally charged. This Court will strike from an injunction decree restraints upon the commission of unlawful acts which are thus dissociated from those which a defendant has committed. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276; New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361, 404\n, 26 S.Ct. 272, 282, and see under the National Labor Relations Act, National Labor Relations Board v. Swift & Co., 7 Cir., 108 F.2d 988.\n It is a salutary principle that when one has been found to have committed acts in violation of a law he may be restrained from committing other related unlawful acts. But we think that without sacrifice of that principle, the National Labor Relations Act does not contemplate that an employer who has unlawfully refused to bargain with his employees shall for the indefinite future, conduct his labor relations at the peril of a summons for contempt on the Board's allegation, for example, that he has discriminated against a labor union in the discharge of an employee, or because his supervisory employees have advised other employees not to join a union. See e.g., H. J. Heinz Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 514\n, 61 S.Ct. 320, decided January 6, 1941\n\n\n Having found the acts which constitute the unfair labor practice the Board is free to restrain the practice and other like or related unlawful acts. But as the Court has held in the case of the Federal Trade Commission, see Federal Trade Commission v. Beech Nut Co., supra, \n257 \nU.S. 455\n, 42 S.Ct. 155, 19 A.L.R. 882, an order not so related should be appropriately restricted on review. The breadth of the order, like the injunction of a court, must depend upon the circumstances of each case, the purpose being to prevent violations, the threat of which in the future is indicated because of their similarity or relation to those unlawful acts which the Board has found to have been committed \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 437]\n\u00a0\n by the employer in the past. See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 308\n, 309 S., 17 S.Ct. 540, 546; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 77\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 522, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; Texas & New Orleans R.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; Local 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n, 54 S.Ct. 396; Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 541\n, 543 S., 544, 57 S.Ct. 592, 596, 597. We hold only that the National Labor Relations Act does not give the Board an authority, which courts cannot rightly exercise, to enjoin violations of all the provisions of the statute merely because the violation of one has been found. To justify an order restraining other violations it must appear that they bear some resemblance to that which the employer has committed or that danger of their commission in the future is to be anticipated from the course of his conduct in the past. That justification is lacking here. To require it is no more onerous or embarrassing to the Board than to a court. And since we are in a field where subtleties of conduct may play no small part, it is appropriate to add that an order of the Board, like the injunction of a court, is not to be evaded by indirections or formal observances which in fact defy it. After an order to bargain collectively in good faith, for example, discriminatory discharge of union members may so affect the bargaining process as to establish a violation of the order.\n The Board places strong reliance on National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation, \n306 \nU.S. 240\n, 59 S.Ct. 490, 123 A.L.R. 599, and on Texas & New Orleans Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 555, 567\n, 568 S., 571, 50 S.Ct. 428, 432, 433, 434, and Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 543, 544\n, 57 S.Ct. 597. In those cases the cease and desist order and the injunctions were substantially like paragraph 1(b) of the Board's order in the present case. But in them the unfair labor practices did not appear to be isolated acts in violation of the right of self-organization, like the refusal \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 438]\n\u00a0\n to bargain here, but the record disclosed persistent attempts by varying methods to interfere with the right of self-organization in circumstances from which the Board or the court found or could have found the threat of continuing and varying efforts to attain the same end in the future.\n An appropriate order in the circumstances of the present case would go no further than to restrain respondent from any refusal to bargain and from any other acts in any manner interfering with the Guild's efforts to negotiate. So far as respondent's past conduct may be thought to have had any effect on the rights guaranteed by  7, such consequences would be effectively prevented by the prohibition of such an order without drawing it so broadly as to forbid all other unrelated unfair labor practices.\n Only a word need be said of that part of the Board's order requiring the posting of notices. We have often held that the posting of notices advising the employees of the Board's order and announcing the readiness of the employer to obey it is within the authority conferred on the Board by  10(c) of the Act 'to take such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies' of the Act. See National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261, 268\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 575, 115 A.L.R. 307; H. J. Heinz Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra.\n But respondent argues that the authority of the Board does not extend to the requirement, such as was made in this case, that the employer confess violation of the Act by a published announcement that he will 'cease and desist' from violating it. See National Labor Relations Board v. A. S. Abell Co., 4 Cir., 97 F.2d 951; Burlington Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 104 F.2d 736; Swift & Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 10 Cir., 106 F.2d 87; Art Metals Construction Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 2 Cir., 110 F.2d 148, 151, 152; Hartsell Mills Co. v. Na- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 439]\n\u00a0\n tional Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 111 F.2d 291, 293. Since the Board has changed its practice and now provides in all orders that the employers' notices shall state 'that he will not engage in the conduct from which he is ordered to cease and desist' it consents that the present order be modified accordingly.\n What we have said requires a reversal of the judgment below and the reestablishment of the Board's order with the following exceptions:\n Paragraph 1(b) of the order will be modified so as to require only that respondent shall cease and desist from 'In any manner interfering with the efforts of the Guild to bargain collectively with Express Publishing Company, San Antonio, Texas'.\n Paragraph 2(b) of the order will be modified by striking from it the words: 'will cease and desist as aforesaid' and substituting for them the words 'will not engage in the conduct from which it is ordered to cease and desist as aforesaid.'\n It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS (dissenting).\n I think the cease and desist order should be enforced in full.\n Respondent did not object in its answer to the Board's petition before the Circuit Court of Appeals to that portion of the Board's order which the Court now modifies. So far as the briefs disclose it did not make any such objection in the Circuit Court of Appeals. Nor did respondent question the propriety of that provision of the order or challenge the power of the Board to make it either in its brief or in its oral argument here. Any controversy on that issue before this Court is therefore not attributable to respondent. For on the record before us \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 440]\n\u00a0\n it must be assumed that respondent wholly acquiesces in that phase of the Board's action. In that posture of the case, it is plain that this Court will not customarily raise sua sponte objections which respondent did not choose to make. We are, of course, asked to enforce an order of the Board. And I suppose we might refuse to enforce provisions of such an order which are patently ultra vires, even though the other party raises no objection but acquiesces in them. But, in my view, this provision of the order is not beyond the power of the Board.\n The order as modified restrains respondent from interfering in any manner 'with the efforts of the Guild to bargain collectively' with it. But respondent is not restrained from interfering with the employees in the exercise of their rights (a) to self-organization, (b) to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or (c) to engage in concerted activities for the purposes of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection. These deletions represent the loss of substantial sanctions- sanctions which the expert administrative agency may well have concluded are basic and essential for protection of the right which this very union has won.\n Take the case where an employer is playing ducks and drakes with the National Labor Relations Act. He pays mere lip service to the requirements of the Act while intent on blocking in his plant any effective union action. If that is a faithful representation of his attitude, the mandate of the Act might be wholly frustrated or its enforcement needlessly delayed were the Board merely to order him to cease and desist from interfering 'with the efforts' of the union 'to bargain collectively'. That, without more, might well be wholly ineffective, or so the Board in its discretion might conclude. In fact, it might even be an open invitation to an employer intent on evasion of the spirit and letter of the Act to resort to devious routes to the same end. Employees are dropped- per- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 441]\n\u00a0\n haps the leaders of the union; labor spies are employed; a company union is sponsored and financed; new employees are selected who promise not to join the outside union. The purpose is to thwart any effective action by that union. Such obstructive tactics could go on apace and yet no 'efforts' of the union 'to bargain collectively' need be denied. The employee could continue the so-called negotiations with the union, perhaps reach The employer could continue the so-called yet in a myriad of ways undermine it if the breadth of the cease and desist order were delimited.\n Perhaps this is to conjure up remote and hypothetical situations. Perhaps that is not this case. \n1\n But I think it is important to remind that we do not sit as an administrative agency with discretion to adjust the remedies accorded by the Act to what we think are the needs of particular cases, with power to write or rewrite administrative orders in light of what we think are the exigencies of specific situations, with the duty to pass on the wisdom of administrative policies. Congress has invested the Board, not us, with discretion to choose and select the remedies necessary or appropriate for the evil at hand.\n The Board concluded (so we must presume) that its order directing respondent to bargain collectively with the Guild need be buttressed by broad protective provisions good against any and all methods of evasion. Formal recitals could hardly make that plainer than it is. \n2\n And clearly those provisions are no broader than \n\n[312 \nU.S. 426, 442]\n\u00a0\n the wide reaches of the controversy disclosed in this record.\n Whether the remedy chosen by the Board was reasonably necessary in this case is not for us to determine. Nor it is for us to say what language is adequate to safeguard the labor rights which are in issue. To cut down the language of this order not only substitutes our judgment for that of the Board; it will also result in the creation of a host of uncertainties. The original order makes clear that any attempted evasion, no matter how devious, is banned. As modified the order clearly subtracts from those sanctions. But the precise extent of its dilution remains uncertain. The Board may, of course, in case of future violations institute new administrative proceedings. Yet the method here chosen for settlement of this labor controversy does not promise peace. It invites a prolongation of the dispute which should be deemed to have been settled, with the employer's acquiescence, once and for all. That practical aspect of the matter is of great importance on the merits; and it also emphasizes the seriousness of our intrusion into the administrative domain. See Note ( 1940) 53 Harv.L.Rev. 472.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice REED join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statements alleged to have been made by officers or agents of respondent were 'Existing independent employment relations may be continued by the individual employees or by employees as a group'. 'No one can compel you to join any organization'. And referring to respondent's treatment of its employees, it was alleged that respondent's officer stated: 'Each of you know we were not forced to do this by any labor organization and no labor organization can force us to do these things'. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It should, however, be noted that the Board concluded that 'the respondent had no intention of negotiating in good faith with the Guild nor of entering into a collective bargaining agreement with it.' And the Circuit Court of Appeals observed, '... we think there was evidence to support the finding of the Board that respondent had determined in advance never to agree to anything.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] In this connection it should be observed that the Board found that respondent had 'interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act' by reading to them a statement which 'presented a distorted concept' of the employees' rights under the Act. The Circuit Court of Appeals set aside that finding. While the Board did not raise that issue in its petition for certiorari, that episode is nevertheless relevant to the scope of the cease and desist order. If it be assumed, as does the majority, that such a broad order must be founded at least on some evidence that other related unlawful acts 'may fairly be anticipated from the defendant's conduct in the past', that episode is of significance. For though it might not of itself support an additional finding of a separate violation of  8, it certainly is some evidence for the exercise of the Board's expert judgment that the refusal to bargain did not have an improbable relationship to other likely obstructive tactics of a related order. \n\n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. LINK-BELT CO.(1941)\nNo. 235\nArgued: December 18, 1940Decided: January 6, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 585]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Robert B.

See National Labor Relations Board v. Waterman Steamship Corp., \n309 \nU.S. 206\n, 60 S.Ct. 493.\n Disestablishment of Independent. Independent Union of Craftsmen was organized within a few days after the decision by this Court, on April 12, 1937, of National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352, which upheld the constitutionality of the Act. From 1933 down to that date the employer, Link-Belt Co., had maintained a company union, apparently continuing to recognize it even after passage of the Act in 1935 and even though under the Act it was concededly an improper bargaining unit. In any event, that union remained in existence until Independent's membership drive was successfully concluded. The organization of Independent was conceived on April 12 and 13, 1937, by certain employees, who were disappointed at the decision upholding the constitutionality of the Act. Linde, who was a leader in organizing Independent, testified: 'A. The Wagner Act had been declared constitutional, and a group of us were dismayed, I am frank to admit, or we thought there was nothing for us to do. Q. Why were you dismayed? A. I will tell you, we had banked our hopes that it would be declared illegal, and immediately the labor unrest and trouble would have stopped and our company would proceed and all the other companies would proceed to enjoy the prosperity which we thought was coming at that time.' The membership drive took place in the main on April 14, 15, and 16, resulting in a membership of 760 out of about 1,000 employees. The constitution was drafted on April 17. On April 18, it \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 587]\n\u00a0\n was decided to seek dissolution of the old company union and recognition of Independent. Accordingly, on April 19 an agreement was reached between the employee representatives and plant manager Berry dissolving the old union; and he was asked to obtain exclusive recognition for Independent. That request was granted by the employer on April 21; and Independent held its first meeting on April 22.\n An 'inside' union, as well as an 'outside' union, may be the product of the right of the employees to self-organization and to collective bargaining 'through representatives of their own choosing', guaranteed by  7 of the Act. The question here is whether the Board was justified in concluding that Independent was not the result of the employees' free choice because the employer had intruded to impair their freedom.\n Respondents point to numerous earmarks of independence which Independent evidences. They emphasize that after it was recognized it held many bargaining conferences and as a result obtained wage increases, changes in seniority policy, bonus payments for night workers, a better vacation policy, better lighting and air conditions, and improved safety measures-in fact, all of its major objectives except a closed shop. They stress the facts that it is not financed by the employer, that its meetings are held off company property, that its leadership is substantially different from the employee representation in the old company union, and that its genesis was a suggestion made not by the employer but by a group of employees.\n In the latter connection they urge that the employees chose Independent because that was the type of labor organization which they honestly preferred; or as stated by one of the employees who led the membership drive, 'It was so big a feature that they (the employees) were all anxious to get on the band wagon and do something. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 588]\n\u00a0\n That was the general attitude.' And they maintain that there was in fact no connection between Independent and the old company union; that the success of Independent's membership drive was not the result of any compulsion or belief as respects the employer's attitude.\n It would indeed be a rare case where the finders of fact could probe the precise factors of motivation which underlay each employee's choice. Normally, the conclusion that their choice was restrained by the employer's interference must of necessity be based on the existence of conditions or circumstances which the employer created or for which he was fairly responsible and as a result of which it may reasonably be inferred that the employees did not have that complete and unfettered freedom of choice which the Act contemplates.\n Here no one fact is conclusive. But the whole congeries of facts before the Board supports its findings.\n The employer's attitude towards unions is relevant. As we have indicated, it maintained a company union both before and after the Act. And the court below sustained the Board's finding as to the employer's long-standing industrial espionage, through the National Metal Trades Association, which continued at least until an investigation was made late in 1936 by the LaFollette Committee of the Senate. \n3\n Further, the employer evidenced hostility towards an 'outside' union. In 1936, plant manager Berry told the board of the company union that 'in the event outside people came into our plant and told us how to run the plant, then I had enough of industry.' At the hearing he testified that he meant 'that the Link Belt Company was able and had \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 589]\n\u00a0\n for many years ran their organization and we did not need outside people to tell us how to run the plant economically and efficiently.' In September, 1936, Salmons, an employee of 14 years standing, who was an employee representative in the company union and who became dissatisfied with it, initiated the formation of Amalgamated, an 'outside' organization. 4 Amalgamated held its first organizing meeting on September 20, 1936. Salmons was discharged the next day by plant manager Berry for 'spreading union propaganda around here.' He was given half an hour to leave. The employer does not deny this but adds that Salmons was discharged because he engaged in union activities on company time. That he did solicit on company time seems clear, though it could hardly have been extensive as his foreman testified that he was not aware of it. Yet in his association with the company union, he apparently was allowed a similar freedom. That fact, his position of leadership in Amalgamated, the apparent absence of the customary warning, his somewhat precipitate discharge, the failure of the employer to discharge representatives of Independent who, as we shall see, solicited on company time with the knowledge and approval of at least some of the supervisors, made permissible the Board's conclusion that Salmons' activity on behalf of the 'outside' union was the basic cause of his discharge. \n5\n On September 21, 1936, another employee, Novak, who had been employed by the company for over 11 years, was also discharged without warning by Berry, who believed, mistakenly it would seem, that Novak was a member of and solicitor \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 590]\n\u00a0\n for Amalgamated. Berry gave him half an hour to get out, after charging him with being 'an organizer and instigator for a union'-a charge which Novak denied. \n6\n The Board found and the court below sustained the finding that Novak was discharged in violation of the Act because of his alleged union activities. We agree.\n Amalgamated, as well as Independent, solicited on company time. But a review of the record indicates that the instances of solicitation by Amalgamated on company time were scattered over a period of months and were apparently more sporadic than those of Independent. At least they do not appear to have had the magnitude and intensity of the acts of solicitation on company time by Independent. There is considerable testimony by members of the supervisory staff that they were instructed not to take sides in the union competition and not to allow solicitation on company time. Plant manager Berry testified on direct examination that those instructions were given after April 12, 1937; and on cross- examination he admitted that they were given only after April 19, 1937, at which time Independent had acquired a membership of 760 men. It is argued here that the employer warned solicitors for Independent and threatened them with dismissal for engaging in union activities on the company's time. And Froling, chairman of the company union and active solicitor for Inde- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 591]\n\u00a0\n pendent, testified that he was wary about soliciting in the plant on company time in front of foremen, for although he did not remember any foreman warning him, he nevertheless was afraid of being discharged because of what had happened to Salmons on account of his activities. It is therefore contended that no discrimination in favor of Independent can be inferred; that the quick success of Independent in obtaining a majority was due not to the employer's support but to the employees' enthusiasm for that union. The Board stresses the fact that employee representatives in the company union were extremely active solicitors for Independent. It points out that at least six of the employee representatives under the company union were active solicitors-Froling virtually admitting that he solicited the entire machine shop-110 to 120 men-during working hours. Kowatch, an employee, signed up between 100 and 250 men, about one-fourth on company time and twice punched out his time with the permission of the foreman to solicit in the foundry. The company counters with the fact that there were many solicitors for Independent of whom those representatives were a mere minority-less than a third. There is this to be said, however, about those conflicting claims. Most of the company union representatives were active and prominent in Independent's membership drive and during that drive apparently enjoyed somewhat the same privilege of moving freely about the plant which they had been allowed as company union representatives-a privilege withdrawn after Independent had been recognized. The instances when supervisors remonstrated with solicitors for Independent seem to be restricted to around six or seven im number, and some of those related to activities after the April membership drive was completed. As respects one of the latter instances, Linde, an employee soliciting for Independent, stated that foremen warned the men: 'You are on union \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 592]\n\u00a0\n business. My God, don't let me catch you or we will fire you, or words to that effect.' But, as the Board concluded, it seems impossible to infer that, in view of the extensive and intensive solicitation for Independent in the plant on company time, the supervisory staff were not aware of the campaign and did not acquiesce in it. Beyond that is the active support of Independent by some of the supervisory staff. There is abundant testimony that Siskauskis, a foreman, actively solicited for Independent. One employee, Lackhouse, who earlier had joined Amalgamated but who was soliciting for Independent in April, 1937, testified:\n'He took the sheets in my hand-the first sheet I had already filled, with the heading on it, and I had nothing but blank sheets left, and he went around the machines, the molders right off the side floor there, and he told them to sign up the Inside union here, and he signed up I believe ten, and about five of them he signed up in his own handwriting. The majority of them in the foundry don't know how to write. Q. And did you see him sign up these other men? A. I seen him sign up actually about seven or eight, I am sure, in his own handwriting. He went as far as one crane man who was working right above him, and he was going up to him and he was going to explain what it was all about, and he says, 'Oh, heck, he don't know how to write,' so he wrote down his name, too. I don't remember his name, I know it was John, the crane man in his department. I just don't know his last name. Q. And then did Mr. Shaskinskis (sic) give you back the paper? A. Yes, he returned them back to me after he had the names on them.'\n\n This episode was confirmed at least in part by Johnson, an employee.\n Another employee, Balcauski, testified as follows respecting Siskauskis' solicitation: \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 593]\n\u00a0\n 'He walked to me and he said, 'Stanley, why don't you join in the C.I.O.'- I mean this here, the independent craftsmen's union. I said, 'I am already with the C.I.O.' He says, 'The hell with the C.I.O.' He says, 'Join in with the craftsmen's union.' He says, 'We are going to have our union.' Then I repeated, I says, 'Do you know under the Wagner Law that is not allowed for the foreman to go and organize the working men on the company time or on his own time?' He told me this, he said, 'To hell with that.' So I says, 'If you want to sign up independent, go ahead, I ain't going to waste my time.' And I walked away.'\n Balcauski further testified respecting Siskauskis' solicitation of employees: 'He told them, 'If you don't sign up'-I heard it with my own ears-he said, 'you are going to get out of here.\"\n Still another employee, Thomas, testified: 'Q. Did anybody ask you to join the Independent Union? A. Everybody, Splitz (Siskauskis) comes to me with piece of paper, sign your name. I say I can't sign my name. He says, 'All right, I sign it myself.' And he signed it himself, my name. Q. Did he say anything more to you about it? A. That is all that day. The second day he come around again. He say, 'Joe, sign name.' I say, 'I sign yesterday.' He say, 'All right, it is no good, I threw it away.' Q. It is no good, he threw it away? A. Sure. I didn't sign no place. 'Joe,' he say, 'Sign him up anyhow, or maybe lose job.' Q. Splitz says to sign up or maybe you lose job? A. Yes. I says, 'I sign him up if you want to.' He come in Thursday about this piece of paper again and he say, 'Joe, sign name.' I say, 'What is the matter, I sign him up twice, I sign him up before yesterday and I sign him again.' He say, 'Something wrong, no good.' I say, 'I quit, I don't want sign at all.' Q. You didn't want to sign? A. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 594]\n\u00a0\n No. Q. You didn't sign either day? A. I don't sign. At noontime he come to me and he say-I was by him over there and he say, 'Come on, Joe, come in office sometime, we want to see you'. Q. Did you go in the office? A. Yes . ... Q. Some may with a mustache was sitting there? A. Yes, sir. He say, 'What you want?' I say, 'Splitz sent me in office, you want something?' He said he didn't want nothing from me. Splitz come in then and grabbed my hand, and he say, 'Give him piece of paper.' He say, 'sign his name.' I can't sign name, I say I will not sign. I said two times I sign, I don't like it. He say, 'Sign anyhow.' Q. Who said that? A. Splitz, 'Go ahead, sign again.' I say, 'I am going out, go to work.' Q. You did not sign? A. No. A couple of times he come to me and say, 'Sign them up.' I don't sign no place. A lot of people don't sign, I no sign.'\n Bozurich, an employee, testified as follows with respect to the attitude of Siskauskis towards Amalgamated: '... then he went on with remarks that it would be very bad if C.I.O. would come into the shop. And I said, 'What would be bad about it?' I said, 'If the workers want it who an stop them?' 'Well,' he said, 'if C.I.O. comes in the company will close the plant.' He said, 'You see during the depression it was hard to be without a job.' I said, 'Company can't lock-close the shop because of the union.' I says, 'That would be considered as a lock-out.' And he said, 'Who can stop them?' 'Well,' I said, 'the government.' He said, 'The company runs the plant and not the government.' I said, 'There is such a thing as government Labor Board here who takes care of those members,' and I believe I referred him to-well, to be exact, I read in the paper about a certain company somewhere in New York or New Jersey that due to C.I.O. activities closed their plant and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 595]\n\u00a0\n moved the machinery out, things like that, to get away from the union. So I call his attention to that, to the best of my recollection from the newspaper, that the Labor Board takes action; they got company to put machinery back. At least that is the way I understood it so the illustration to him is that we are not afraid of that kind. Then he twisted his lips and said 'Oh,' he says, 'you better keep away from something like that,' he says, 'and if you want anything it is best to go to boss yourself.\"\n There is also testimony that Siskauskis signed for illiterate employees, though, with one possible exception, apparently not against their will. Siskauskis denied that he made any such statements or that he ever solicited for Independent. The Board refused to believe that all the opposing testimony was fabricated, and found his denials unconvincing.\n Lackhouse, an employee, testified that he obtained permission from Nyberg, his foreman, to solicit for Independent, Nyberg saying, 'Well, if you have to, you have to, Frank, so you might as well go ahead on it.' Lackhouse was delayed about half an hour in getting started when Olson, an assistant superintendent, took him aside in a separate room and, according to Lackhouse, 'compared the differences between the outside union and the inside union; and he told me about it up there, how much better off we would be if we organized amongst us fellows, among our fellow workmen ourselves and kept the outside union out, that you will never get anywhere with them, just striking all the time, and give me the differences, and I listened to him about it.' Lackhouse testified that thereupon he solicited in the plant during working hours: 'I was absent from my job from one o'clock until quitting time walking through the whole foundry.' On direct examination Olson denied this \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 596]\n\u00a0\n On cross-examination he admitted talking briefly with Lackhouse about 'a rumor that the boys are trying to form an independent union.' Nyberg was not called. The Board believed Lackhouse.\n There was considerable testimony, not denied, that Belov, a night boss, also solicited for Independent. According to one employee, Kalamarie, Belov did so on written instructions left by foreman McKinney which Kalamarie read. Kalamarie testified as follows respecting this conversation with Belov about those instructions: 'Q. So when he (Belov) got this note to solicit for the Independent Union he was a little bit puzzled by it and he asked your advice about it? A. He did. Q. You advised him that inasmuch as his superior officer, Mr. McKinney, had ordered him to do it, he had better go ahead and do it? A. That is right, if he wanted to keep his job. I imagine he should.'\n McKinney denied that he had left any such instructions, though it apparently was his custom to leave written instructions for the night bosses on things he wanted done. Belov was not called. Because of that and because of the contradictory character of McKinney's testimony on certain matters, the Board believed Kalamarie.\n Tomas, an employee, testified that his boss, Big Louie, 'a kind of assistant foreman,' solicited for Independent getting about ten signatures; that Big Louie told him that 'they were trying to get the C.I.O. out of there.'\n The court below was unable to find any evidence from which it could be inferred that the employees did not, with complete independence and freedom from domination, interference or support of the employer, form their own union. But we are of the opinion that \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 597]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals in reaching that conclusion substituted its judgment on disputed facts for the Board's judgment-a power which has been denied it by the Congress. Sec. 10(e) provides that the 'findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.' As we stated in National Labor Relations Board v. Waterman Steamship Corp., supra, 309 U.S. at pages 208, 209, 60 S.Ct. at pages 495, 496: '... Congress has left questions of law which arise before the Board-but not more-ultimately to the traditional review of the judiciary. Not by accident, but in line with a general policy, Congress has deemed it wise to entrust the finding of facts to these specialized agencies. It is essential that courts regard this division of responsibility which Congress as a matter of policy has embodied in the very statute from which the Court of Appeals derived its jurisdiction to act.' Congress entrusted the Board, not the courts, with the power to draw inferences from the facts. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc ., \n303 \nU.S. 261, 271\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 576, 115 A.L.R. 307; National Labor Relations Board v. Falk Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 453, 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 307, 311. The Board, like other expert agencies dealing with specialized fields (see Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 146\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, 764; Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297, 304\n, 57 S.Ct. 478, 481) has the function of appraising conflicting and circumstantial evidence, and the weight and credibility of testimony.\n The Board had the right to believe that the maintenance of the company union down to the date when Independent's membership drive was completed was not a mere coincidence. The circumstantial evidence makes credible the finding that complete freedom of choice on the part of the employees was effectively forestalled by maintenance of the company union by the employer until its abandonment would coincide with the recognition of Independent. The declared hostility towards an \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 598]\n\u00a0\n 'outside' union, the long practice of industrial espionage, the quick recognition of Independent, the support given Independent's membership drive by some of the supervisory staff, the prominence of company union representatives in that drive, the failure of the employer to wipe the slate clean and announce that the employees had a free choice, the belated instructions to the supervisory staff not to interfere-all corroborate the conclusion that the employer facilitated and aided the substitution of the union, which it preferred, for its old company union. But respondents contend that there is no evidence that the employees had a settled conviction that the employer preferred a certain type of labor organization or that they were under compulsion from the employer in choosing between Independent and Amalgamated. There were, however, forces at work in the plant which make tenable the conclusion of the Board that the employer had intruded so as effectively to restrain the employees' choice. The employer's attitude towards an 'outside' union coupled with the discharge of Salmons and Novak for activities on behalf of Amalgamated would tend to have as potent an effect as direct statements to the employees that they could not afford to risk selection of Amalgamated. That the discrimination against Salmons had some effect is not denied, for Froling, a witness for Independent, insisted that even he furtively solicited for Independent because of the price paid by Salmons. When that discrimination is contrasted to the apparent acquiescence by the management in the open solicitation by Independent, we cannot say that the Board was unjustified in the conclusion which it drew. As we stated in International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72\n, 61 S.Ct. 83, 88, decided Nov. 12, 1940, 'Slight suggestions as to the employer's choice between unions may have telling effect among men who \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 599]\n\u00a0\n know the consequences of incurring that employer's strong displeasure.' Nor does the Board lack the power to give weight to the activities of some of the supervisory employees on behalf of Independent, even though they did not have the power to hire or to fire. As we indicated in International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, the strict rules of respondeat superior are not applicable to such a situation. If the words or deeds of the supervisory employees, taken in their setting, were reasonably likely to have restrained the employees' choice and if the employer may fairly be said to have been responsible for them, they are a proper basis for the conclusion that the employer did interfere. If the employees 'would have just cause to believe that solicitors professedly for a labor organization were acting for and on behalf of the management, the Board would be justified in concluding that they did not have the complete and unhampered freedom of choice which the Act contemplates.' International Association of Machinists v. National Albor Relations Board, supra. Here such inferences were wholly justified. The attitude of the employer towards an 'outside' organization was clearly conveyed. When that was followed by solicitation for Independent on the part of supervisors who had general authority over the men, it would be unfair to conclude that the employees did not feel an actual pressure from the management. That fact, the failure of the employer to announce its impartiality, its delay in advising the supervisors to remain neutral until Independent had acquired its majority, the favors shown Independent, the discharge of Salmons and Novak, its past union policy, all are part of the imponderables which the Board was entitled to appraise. The fact that these various forces at work were subtle rather than direct does not mean that they were none- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 600]\n\u00a0\n theless effective. Intimations of an employer's preference, though subtle, may be as potent as outright threats of discharge.\n Respondents suggest that an order of disestablishment would make Independent an innocent victim of the employer's inaction r of its unwelcome action. It is urged that the subsequent conduct of Independent demonstrates its independence and that an order directing the employer to cease and desist all interference with the employees and with Independent is wholly adequate for the evil at hand. The Board, however, was not forced to conclude that the subsequent activities of Independent erased the effects of the employer's earlier discrimination, any more than it was compelled to believe that the employer's later show of impartiality obliterated the consequences of its prior interference with the employees' freedom of choice. We cannot assume that the employees will be free from improper restraints and will have the complete freedom of choice which the Act contemplates where the effect of the unfair labor practice is not completely dissipated. The Board not the courts determines under this statutory scheme how the effect of unfair labor practices may be expunged. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Bradford Dyeing Ass'n, \n310 \nU.S. 318\n, 60 S.Ct. 918; International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, supra.\n The order of disestablishment must be enforced.\n Discharges of Employees. The court below rejected the finding of the Board that Salmons had been discharged in violation of  8(1) and (3) of the Act. For the reasons already stated, we think that the court erred and that the Board was right. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 601]\n\u00a0\n The Board found that in April, 1937, employment manager Staskey conditioned the employment of Frank Solinko upon the acceptance of membership in the Independent by his father, Pete Solinko; and that therefore the company had violated  8(3) of the Act. \n8\n The Board credited the testimony of Pete and Frank Solinko against testimony of Staskey and an employee named Kowatch. Kowatch was a solicitor for Independent whom Pete Solinko said Staskey had told him to see. Pete, a member of Amalgamated, joined Independent. So did Frank, who later, however, joined Amalgamated. The evidence is somewhat confusing. But even according to Staskey, Pete Solinko did show him an Independent card the day Frank was hired. The court below noted that even if the testimony of Pete were true, the conversation occurred two months before Frank was hired; and even if it took place on the day he was hired, then it was after Independent had been recognized by the company as the bargaining agent for the employees. We think, however, that the Board's finding was justified. Whenever the conversation took place, the conditioning of Frank's employment upon Pete's joining Independent was a violation of  8(3) of the Act in absence of a valid closed-shop agreement, not present here. Viewed in that light, it also corroborates the conclusion of the Board that the employer interfered with the collective bargaining process by supporting Independent, though the episode took place after Independent's membership drive was completed.\n Karbol and Cumorich were discharged May 19, 1937. In April, 1937, Belov, according to their testimony, had asked them to join Independent. They refused. In the latter part of April, 1937, they joined Amalgamated. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 602]\n\u00a0\n The company's claim is that they were discharged for unsatisfactory work after time studies had shown their inefficiency and after the day foreman, McKinney, had warned them that their work was not satisfactory. On the other hand, they denied that anyone had given them any such warning or had criticized their work; they testified that at the time of their discharge Belov stated that they were good workmen and that he did not know why they were discharged. The Board reviewed the time studies and found they did not reveal with any degree of precision the relative efficiency of the men. It concluded that they were discharged because they joined Amalgamated. The evidence as to inefficiency is quite inconclusive. The Board was justified in relying on circumstantial evidence of discrimination and was not required to deny relief because there was no direct evidence that the employer knew these men had joined Amalgamated and was displeased or wanted to make an example of them.\n The court below also refused to enforce the Board's order reinstating and making whole Kalamarie who was discharged according to the Board because of his union activities. He, like Karbol and Cumorich, did not accede to the solicitation of Belov on behalf of Independent. He had joined Amalgamated in March, 1937, was an active solicitor for it, and served on its grievance committee. As a member of that committee, he called on plant manager Berry to protest the lay-off of a union man. Shortly thereafter, Belov, Kalamarie's night boss, received instructions from the day foreman to lay Kalamarie off for a week if his work did not improve. November 30, 1937, he was permanently laid off for an alleged lack of work as a welder and in connection with a general reduction of employees. Until his promotion as a welder a few months earlier Kalamarie for some time had been an acetylene burner. He testified that when \n\n[311 \nU.S. 584, 603]\n\u00a0\n he took the job as welder, he was promised that he could go back to burning without loss of his seniority rights if welding ran out. This was denied by the foreman. When he was laid off, men junior to him as burners were retained. He protested. The company insists that the refusal to restore Kalamarie to his old position as burner was consistent with its occupational seniority policy. On this there is some contradiction in the record. There is testimony that under company practice an employee retained (or at least might be given) his original seniority if he was promoted to another position in the same department. The reasons stated for not restoring Kalamarie to his old seniority position were that he did not ask to be put back and that the company would have had to lay off a burner senior to him. These statements were contrary to the facts as found by the Board. On this state of the record we think that the Board was justified in concluding that Kalamarie was in fact discharged because of his activities for Amalgamated.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals with directions to enforce the Board's order in full.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These proceedings were instituted on charges filed in 1937 and 1938 by Lodge 1604 of Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers of North America, affiliated with the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, and through it with the Committee for Industrial Organization. The complaint, as amended, charged that the employer, respondent in No. 235, had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of  8(1), (2), and (3), of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  158(1), (2), and (3), 29 U.S.C.A.  158(1-3). Independent Union of Craftsmen, respondent in No. 236, was allowed to intervene, was represented by counsel and participated throughout the proceedings. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Board did not sustain the charges that certain other employees had been discharged because of their union activities. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor, United States Senate, of which Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr., was Chairman. This Subcommittee acted pursuant to S. Res. 266, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., and held extensive hearings beginning in 1936. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See note 1, supra. Amalgamated apparently had about 400 members before independent started its membership drive in April, 1937. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Salmons was rehired on December 21, 1936, after mediation by the Board on the understanding that he would not engage in union activities on company time. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Novak was reinstated in January, 1937, with the understanding that he would not engage in union activities on company time. According to him, the condition extended to union activities at all times. According to the company, it covered only union activities on company time. The Board did not resolve the conflict but noted that Novak, as a result of his understanding, did not join Amalgamated until after the Act had been upheld in April, 1937. Novak delayed accepting the proposal of reinstatement because of the possible implication that thereby he would tacitly admit that he had earlier engaged in union activities. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Board ordered no affirmative relief with respect to Salmons as he had been reinstated under an agreement with the company that he would not receive back pay. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] No affirmative relief was ordered as respects Pete Solinko, who was laid off in January, 1938. \n\n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. WHITE SWAN CO.(1941)\nNo. 529\nArgued: March 10, 1941Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert. H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for National Labor Relations Board.\n Mr. Herman C. A. Hofacker, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for White Swan Co. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit submitted pursuant to  239 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346, is as follows:\n This is a petition for enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board, which directed the White Swan Company, a corporation of Wheeling, West Virginia, engaged in the operation of a laundry and dry cleaning business, to cease and desist from certain unfair labor practices and to offer employment with back pay to certain employees held to have been discharged because of union affiliation and activities. The findings of the Board with respect to the unfair labor practices and discriminatory discharge of employees are sustained by substantial evidence; but a question has arisen, as to which the members of the Court are divided and in doubt, with respect to the jurisdiction of the Board in the premises.\n The respondent, White Swan Company, operates a combined laundry and dry cleaning establishment in the city of Wheeling, West Virginia. While certain of its supplies are obtained from without the state, the volume of the interstate business thus involved is not sufficient, in our opinion, to bring the business within the jurisdiction of the Board. The record shows that these supplies consist of soap, bluing, bleach, solvent, coal, water, paper, tape and padding, and that respondent's purchases thereof during 1938 amounted to $38,333.15, of which $10,810.90 came from without the state. Respondent, however, operates delivery trucks in Ohio as well as in West Virginia, three of the delivery routes from its plant being in Ohio and eleven in West Virginia. The business involved is necessarily of a purely local character, as the record shows that a radius of fifteen miles is the practical limit for a laundry or dry-cleaning business in this territory. The fact that business is done in Ohio outside the state in which respondent's laundry is located, results from the fact that this purely local business is \n\n[313 \nU.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n located in a city on a state line. Respondent transports garments in its trucks from those of its customers who reside in Ohio to its plant in West Virginia to be serviced, and then after servicing returns the garments in its trucks to the customers. Approximately 12.93 per cent of its gross income for 1938 was derived from this source. In addition thereto, approximately 5 per cent of its gross income during 1938 was derived from the servicing of garments which persons not in its employment collected in Ohio, brought to its plant for servicing and delivered in Ohio after they had been serviced. Respondent's total gross income in 1938 was $128,752.96. The total income from the business obtained from persons in Ohio during this period was $28,088.43.\n We recognize that the collection and delivery of garments across state lines, as above described, constitutes interstate commerce. We are advertent, however, to the admonition of the court that in applying the act we are to bear in mind 'the distinction between what is national and what is local in the activities of commerce.' National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. (\n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 (57 S.Ct. 615, 621, 108 A.L.R. 1352)). And although the letter of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., may cover such collections and deliveries in interstate commerce as are here involved, the question arises whether a proper interpretation of the Act, in view of the intent of Congress, would include them. Cf. United States v. Sorrells, \n287 \nU.S. 435\n, 446 (53 S.Ct. 210, 214, 86 A.L.R. 249). We are divided and in doubt as to whether such collection and delivery, which results from the fact that business of a local character, such as a laundry, is located on a state line, is sufficient to bring such business within the jurisdiction of the Board under the National Labor Relations Act. To so hold would be to bring under the jurisdiction of the Board a great variety of business of purely local character simply because they maintain a delivery service in cities located on state lines. As there are many such cities in the United States, the question seems to us one of sufficient importance to justify us in certifying it to the Supreme Court so that it may be definitely settled.\n Being divided and in doubt, therefore, this Court respectfully certifies to the Supreme Court of the United States, for its instruction and advice, the following ques- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n tions of law, the determination of which is indispensable to proper decision of the case.\n\n 1. \nShould the National Labor Relations Act be interpreted as having application to a business of purely local character, such as a laundry, merely because such business is located in a city on a state line and derives a substantial portion of its income from business which involves collections or deliveries of articles in a state other than that in which the business is located?\n\n 2. \nWhere a local business, such as a laundry, is located in a city on a state line, and is not engaged in interstate commerce, except in so far as it may collect articles to be serviced and may make deliveries to customers living across the state line, is such business, by reason of such collections and deliveries, deemed engaged in 'commerce' within the meaning of Subsection 6 of Section 2 of the Act of July 5, 1935, ch. 372, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(6), so that an unfair labor practice on its part would be an unfair labor practice 'affecting commerce' within the meaning of Subsection 7 of said section, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(7) and Subsection (a) of Section 10, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a)?1\n The certificate must be dismissed.\n By  10(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 453, 29 U.S.C.  160(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a), the Board is empowered 'to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 8( 158)) affecting commerce.' The term 'affecting commerce' is defined in  2( 7) as 'in commerce, or burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce, or having led or tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.' And 'commerce' by  2(6) is defined so as to include 'trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States.' On a review of an order of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n the Board in a Circuit Court of Appeals the 'findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.'  10(e).\n The questions do not focus 'the controversy in its setting.' Lowden v. Northwestern National Bank & Trust Co., \n298 \nU.S. 160, 163\n, 56 S.Ct. 696, 698. From the certificate we do not know on what grounds the Board based its jurisdiction-that the business was 'in commerce' or that it was embraced within the other categories described in  2(7) of the Act. The terms 'business of purely local character' and 'local business' are meaningful for purposes of  10(a) of the Act only in light of specific findings of the Board. To answer the questions we would have to make a supposition as to the sense in which the Board made its finding under  10(a) that the unfair labor practices were 'affecting commerce'. The necessity of making that supposition reveals the hypothetical and abstract quality of the questions. And the fact that on the whole record the answer might be clear whichever the theory of the Board's findings does not make the questions any the less defective. The reviewing court is passing on the validity of a specific order of the Board. Since the questions certified do not reflect the precise conclusions of the Board and the precise findings on which those conclusions were based, they necessarily have an 'objectionable generality'. See United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 35 S.Ct. 16, 18; White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 51 S.Ct. 115, 117; Triplett v. Lowell, \n297 \nU.S. 638, 648\n, 56 S.Ct. 645, 650; Atlas Life Ins. Co. v. W.I. Southern, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 563, 571\n, 59 S.Ct. 657, 661; Pflueger v. Sherman, \n293 \nU.S. 55, 57\n, 58 S., 55 S.Ct. 10, 11. And if, in this case, they did reflect those conclusions and findings, they would be defective as calling for a 'decision of the whole case'.

New York Central Railroad Co., \n275 \nU.S. 179, 188\n, 48 S.Ct. 39, 40, 41.\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court denied a motion made by the Solicitor General to amend the certificate by embodying the purchase of supplies in interstate commerce as well as the collections and deliveries. \n\n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNELSON v. MONTGOMERY WARD & CO.(1941)\nNo. 256\nArgued: Decided: February 17, 1941\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Mar. 17, 1941\n\n\n See \n312 \nU.S. 716\n, 61 S.Ct. 804, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Mr. John E. Mulroney, of Des Moines, Iowa, for petitioners.\n Mr. Stuart S. Ball, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The issue in this case is identical with that in Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 359\n, 61 S.Ct. 586, 85 L.Ed. --, No. 255, decided this day. Respondent is an Illinois corporation authorized to do business in Iowa. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n Respondent operates retail stores and mail order houses throughout the United States. It has 29 retail stores1 and several order offices in Iowa. It collects the Iowa tax on sales made at the retail stores and on sales handled by those order offices. But it has refused to collect the tax2 on orders sent directly from Iowa customers to its out of state mail order houses and filled by direct shipments through the mails or a common carrier to the purchasers in Iowa. Respondent, in seeking an affirmance of the judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court3 (Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Roddewig, 228 Iowa, 1273, 292 N.W. 142) which held that the Iowa Use \n\n[312 \nU.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n Tax, Code Iowa 1939,  6943.102 et seq., as applied to these mail orders is unconstitutional,4 makes substantially the same arguments5 as were advanced in Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra. Distribution of catalogues in Iowa apparently involves no act of respondent or its agents within the state. There was testimony that no employee of the mail order houses lives in Iowa; that there are no acts of respondent in Iowa in regard to any of the orders sent to the out of state mail order houses; and that respondent has no machinery for collecting sums due from Iowa customers by individuals within the state, it not being the practice of respondent to refer its delinquent mail order accounts to its retail stores in Iowa for collection. Those facts are immaterial. Some of respondent's employees are in Iowa representing it in the course of business which it is conducting pursuant to its permit to do business in that state. The fact that other of its employees who work in the mail order houses and handle the mail orders here involved are not in Iowa is wholly irrelevant. It does not permit respondent to escape the burden which Iowa has exacted as a price of enjoying the full benefits flowing from its aggregate Iowa business. Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n There is a further fact in this record which makes a reversal of this judgment necessary. It was stipulated that 'advertisements have been caused to be printed by the retail stores of the petitioner (Montgomery Ward and Co.) in the State of Iowa, advertising not only retail merchandise, but the ability to complete service through the use of the catalog.' This stipulation clearly means that respondent has solicited mail order sales in Iowa. The fact that that solicitation was done through local advertisements rather than directly by local agents as in Felt & tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376, is immaterial. Nor is it material that the orders were filled by direct shipments from points outside the state to purchasers within the state. For that method of delivery also obtained in case of some of the orders involved in Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, supra.\n The effect of admitted facts is a question of law. Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 281\n, 37 S.Ct. 287; Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, \n308 \nU.S. 39, 51\n, 60 S.Ct. 51, 59.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion in No. 255, Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co ., \n312 \nU.S. 359\n, 61 S.Ct. 586, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The investment in these stores is over $900,000. The approximate sales by these stores in 1937 was $7,716,000. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the catalogues sent into Iowa there was the following notice:\n'To our Iowa Customers:\n\n'We believe that certain of the provisions of the Iowa Use Tax law as applied to our business, are unconstitutional. Therefore we are not collecting or reporting the Use Tax on mail orders sent by Iowa customers direct to any of our mail order houses.\n\n'Until you hear from us to the contrary, mail in your orders just as you have in the past.\n\n MONTGOMERY WARD & CO.'\n It was testified that the purpose of this notice was not to intimate to Iowa purchasers that by mailing their orders to mail order houses outside the state they could secure a two per cent differential over purchases made in the state. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] One question, not raised by the petition for certiorari, related to the duty of respondent to collect the use tax on sales made in retail stores located near, but outside, the boundaries of Iowa, where the purchaser was a resident of Iowa and purchased the property for use in Iowa. The Supreme Court of Iowa, one judge dissenting, held that the Use Tax Act as applied to these transactions was unconstitutional. Chief Justice Hamilton, who dissented from the judgment as respects the mail orders, concurred insofar as sales from the out of state retail stores were concerned, saying that respondent 'has no feasible way of knowing or ascertaining where the customer lives or where he is going to make use of the merchandise purchased' and that to impose the burden of tax collection on it would be to give it 'an almost impossible task.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Respondent's bill also contained allegations that the Use Tax as applied contravened certain provisions of the Iowa constitution. Those issues, however, were not passed on by the Iowa Supreme Court. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Its experience with the Illinois sales tax shows that only 75% of the Illinois customers remit the tax with their orders. Due bills are sent ( except for deficiencies less than two cents) and 58% are not collected. Based on this experience respondent estimates that out of $10,000 of use taxes on mail orders from Iowa customers, it would be able to collect $8, 550. If no notices were included in the catalogues sent into Iowa, then based on its Illinois experience respondent estimates that only 42% of the due bills would be collected. In addition to these deficits respondent asserts that it would incur a direct cost ranging from $890 to $1040 for every $10,000 of tax liability. \n\n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNELSON v.

The Supreme Court of Iowa, in a five to four decision, held for respondent \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n on that issue. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Roddewig, 228 Iowa 1273, 292 N.W. 130. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the constitutional question presented. \n311 \nU.S. 630\n, 61 S.Ct. 34, 85 L.Ed. --. Jud.Code  237( b), 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).\n The Iowa Use Tax is complementary to the Iowa Retail Sales Tax. Iowa Code 1939,  6943.074, et seq. It is a tax on the use in Iowa of tangible personal property at the rate of two per cent of the purchase price. \n1\n 'Use', so far as material here, is defined as 'the exercise by any person of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property.'  6943.102. While the tax is imposed on 'every person using such property within this state until such tax has been paid',  6943.103, it is further provided,  6943.109, that every 'retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and making sales of tangible personal property for use in this state ... shall at the time of making such sales, whether within or without the state, collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the purchaser ....' By  6943.112 the tax constitutes a 'debt owed by the retailer' to the state. \n2\n And if the retailer \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n fails to collect the tax, etc., his retailer's permit,  6943.084, may be revoked; and in case of a foreign corporation, its permit to do business in the state as well.  6943.122.\n Respondent is a New York corporation authorized since 1928 to do business in Iowa. It has various retail stores there. It pays the tax on sales made at those stores. It also pays the tax on orders placed at those stores, though shipment is made direct of the purchaser from one of respondent's out of state branches. But it has refused to collect the tax on mail orders sent by Iowa purchasers to its out of state branches and filled by direct shipments through the mails or a common carrier from those branches to the purchasers. \n3\n On threat of petitioners to revoke respondent's permit because of such refusal, respondent brought this suit for an injunction, alleging, inter alia, that the Act as applied violates Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution and Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Iowa Supreme Court held that if respondent had limited its activities to a mail order business of the kind here involved, it would not be doing business in Iowa; \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n that, although technically the tax may be one the purchaser, it must be collected when the sale is made, at which time the property is outside the state; that these sales are separate and distinct from respondent's activities in Iowa. It therefore concluded that the tax as applied was unconstitutional since Iowa has no power to regulate respondent's activities outside the state or to regulate such activities as a condition to respondent's right to continue to do business in the state.\n It passing on the constitutionality of a tax law 'we are concerned only with its practical operation, not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it.' Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 557, 87 A.L.R. 374; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 167, 177\n, 59 S.Ct. 389, 393; Wisconsin v. J. C.

The fact that under Iowa law the sale is made outside the state does not mean that the power of Iowa 'has nothing on which to operate.' Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra. The purchaser is in Iowa and the tax is upon use in Iowa. The validity of such a tax, so far as the purchaser is concerned, 'has been withdrawn from the arena of debate.' Henneford v. Silas Mason Co ., \n300 \nU.S. 577, 583\n, 57 S.Ct. 524, 527; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, supra. It is one of the well-known functions of the integrated use and sales tax to remove the buyers' temptation 'to place their orders in other states in the effort to escape payment of the tax on local sales.' Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra, 300 U.S. at page 581, 57 S.Ct. at page 526. As pointed out in that case (300 U.S. at page 582, 57 S.Ct. at page 526), the fact that the buyer employs agencies of interstate commerce in order to effectuate his purchase is not material, since the tax is 'upon the privilege of use after commerce is at an end.' And see Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, supra. Use in Iowa is what is taxed regardless of the time and place of passing title and regardless of the time the tax is required to be paid. Cf. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33, 49\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 393, 128 A.L.R. 876. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n So the nub of the present controversy centers on the use of respondent as the collection agent for Iowa. The imposition of such a duty, however, was held not to be an unconstitutional burden on a foreign corporation in Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86\n, 54 S.Ct. 575, and Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376. But respondent insists that those cases involved local activity by the foreign corporation as a result of which property was sold to its local customers, while in the instant case there is no local activity by respondent which generates or which relates to the mail orders here involved. Yet these orders are still a part of respondent's Iowa business. The fact that respondent could not be reached for the tax if it were not qualified to do business in Iowa would merely be a result of the 'impotence of state power.' Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra. Since Iowa has extended to it that privilege, Iowa can exact this burden as a price of enjoying the full benefits flowing from its Iowa business. Cf. Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra. Respondent cannot avoid that burden though its business is departmentalized. Whatever may be the inspiration for these mail orders, however they may be filled, Iowa may rightly assume that they are not unrelated to respondent's course of business in Iowa. They are nonetheless a part of that business though none of respondent's agents in Iowa actually solicited or placed them. Hence to include them in the global amount of benefits which respondent is receiving from Iowa business is to conform to business facts.\n Nor is the mode of enforcing the tax on the privileges of these Iowa transactions any discrimination against interstate commerce. As we have seen, the use tax and the sales tax are complementary. Sales made wholly within Iowa carry the same burden as these mail order sales. A tax or other burden obviously does not discriminate against interstate commerce where 'equality \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n is the theme.' Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra, 300 U.S. at pages 583- 586, 57 S.Ct. at pages 527, 528; McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., supra, 309 U.S. at pages 48, 49, 60 S.Ct. at page 393, 128 A.L.R. 876.\n Respondent, however, insists that the duty of tax collection placed on it constitutes a regulation of and substantial burden upon interstate commerce and results in an impairment of the free flow of such commerce. It points to the fact that in its mail order business it is in competition with out of state mail order houses which need not and do not collect the tax on their Iowa sales. But those other concerns are not doing business in the state as foreign corporations. Hence, unlike respondent, they are not receiving benefits from Iowa for which it has the power to exact a price. Respondent further stresses the cost to it of making these collections and its probable loss as a result of its inability to collect the tax on all sales. \n4\n But cost and inconvenience inhered in the same duty imposed on the foreign corporations in the Monamotor and Felt & Tarrant cases. And so far \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n as assumed losses on tax collections are concerned, respondent is in no position to found a constitutional right on the practical opportunities for tax avoidance which its method of doing business affords Iowa residents, or to claim a constitutional immunity because it may elect to deliver the goods before the tax is paid.\n Prohibited discriminatory burdens on interstate commerce are not to be determined by abstractions. Particular facts of specific cases determine whether a given tax prohibitively discriminates against interstate commerce. Hence a review of prior adjudications based on widely disparate facts, howsoever embedded in general propositions, does not facilitate an answer to the present problem.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Iowa Supreme Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The respondent, a New York corporation, conducts an interstate mail order business. It has also established retail stores throughout the country. In 1928, to secure the privilege of conducting stores in Iowa as a foreign corporation, it obtained a permit which has been kept in force by payment of the fees prescribed by the State. No question arises with respect to the collection by the respondent of the tax on sales made in stores in Iowa or on sales based upon orders taken in those stores but filled by forwarding articles from a warehouse in another state.\n The controversy arises only over pure mail order sales. These are consummated in the following manner: The respondent forwards to persons in Iowa catalogues de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n tailing the articles it has for sale, the prices, and the cost of transporting them. A person in Iowa forwards his written order to one of the respondent's mail order houses located outside Iowa for the purchase of tangible personal property as listed and priced in respondent's catalogue, the order being accompanied by a remittance of the purchase price, plus transportation charges, and usually specifying the method of transportation desired by the purchaser. The order is accepted or rejected at the place where it is received and, if accepted, is filled by delivery to the post office or to a carrier for direct shipment from the extra- state mail order house to the purchaser in Iowa.\n This mail order branch of respondent's business is separate and distinct from any activity conducted at its stores in Iowa. In conducting it the respondent is in direct competition with other mail order houses which conduct their business in exactly similar fashion but have no stores in Iowa and are not therein registered as foreign corporations.\n The method necessarily pursued in the respondent's mail order business makes it a certainty that it will be unable, by whatever practical efforts it may put forth, to collect the amount of the use tax on all its mail order sales made to persons in Iowa. In 1937 the number of its mail order transactions with some 300,000 persons in Iowa was approximately 1,200,000. Under the statute as attempted to be enforced against its mail order business, if, in 1937, the respondent had failed to collect from each customer the sum involved as tax, it would have been liable to Iowa in the aggregate for two per cent. on approximately $5,400, 000,-the volume of its Iowa mail order business in that year. If it had made the effort to collect the tax, the cost of so doing would have been approximately eighteen per cent. of the total tax on the mail order sales made to persons in Iowa and, in addition to that cost, the respondent would have been liable \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n for approximately $38,000 of tax uncollected from purchasers. In addition, as a result of the exaction, the respondent's mail order business will be placed at a serious disadvantage in competition with other mail order concerns which have no retail stores in Iowa and so have a price advantage of two per cent. of sales price as against respondent.\n The penalty for failing to collect the tax as agent for the State, or to pay the sum not susceptible of collection from purchasers, as required by the State, will be the revocation of respondent's permit for the conduct of its stores in Iowa, which represent a large expenditure for furniture, fixtures, appliances, and stock, and will entail loss of rental values under long term leases.\n I am of opinion that the attempted enforcement of the statute in the manner proposed by the taxing authorities of the State violates both the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n First. The respondent's mail order business is interstate commerce,1 and Iowa may not prohibit the respondent from conducting that business with her citizens. \n2\n To attempt so to do would be a violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n Not only so, but Iowa may not directly burden such commerce. Therefore she may not tax the privilege of engaging in it; regulate or license its pursuit, 3 or tax the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n gross income derived from it. \n4\n And even if the respondent maintained a force of agents in Iowa soliciting orders to be shipped in interstate commerce that fact would not render it amenable to the regulation or taxation of its mail order business. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Thus Iowa may not lawfully license or regulate the business of agents soliciting orders to be shipped in interstate commerce;6 or limit or condition the right to enforce mail order contracts in Iowa courts. \n7\n The power to exclude foreign corporations altogether from doing a local business does not enable the State to impose burdens upon the transaction of interstate commerce by a foreign corporation registered in the State; and registration by a foreign corporation in order to do business within the State does not constitute a waiver of the corporation's right to transact interstate business free from the burdens of state regulation or taxation. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Iowa may not abuse its conceded power to tax or regulate the respondent's activities within the State by attempting to compel compliance by the respondent with unconstitutional efforts to tax or burden its interstate commerce. \n9\n And Iowa may not forfeit, as it proposes to do, the right to conduct a domestic business by reason of the refusal of the respondent to submit to a burden upon its interstate business. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 370]\n\u00a0\n Clearly in this instance the effort is directly and substantially to burden the transaction of an interstate business with the state's citizens, in violation of the commerce clause, by the threat of penalizing disobedience by the forfeiture of the right to transact, within Iowa, an independent business which the respondent conducts in accordance with all existing laws, including the law requiring it to deduct and pay over the amount of the Iowa sales tax. Upon reason, as well as upon the unbroken current of authority in this court, Iowa has no such power to burden interstate commerce.\n Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86\n, 54 S.Ct. 575, and Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376, relied upon by the petitioners, are not in point.\n The first is not apposite because there the company was engaged in the distribution of gasoline in the State of Iowa. This was the only activity drawn in question. The statute merely required the company, in distributing gasoline to users, to add the tax to its sales price and report and return the amount of tax thus withheld. In the second, the collection of the use tax was imposed with respect to property sold by the corporation through its general agents who were doing business in the State of California and were handling articles sold for delivery in that State. As an incident of such sales, the seller was required to add the tax and make return of it to the State. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n In justification of the exaction it is said that the purchaser is in Iowa and the tax is on the purchaser's use in that State. But if these facts were determinative they would justify the imposition of a tax or burden, by the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 371]\n\u00a0\n state of the purchaser's residence, on every transaction in which goods are sold in interstate commerce. Attention is also called to the fact that Iowa cannot effectively reach its own citizens in order to enforce the use tax on them. This cannot, however, justify the state's attempt to save itself trouble by placing an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce conducted by a citizen of another state. Reference is made to the circumstance that, as a similar tax is laid on local sales in Iowa, there is no discrimination in imposing the tax or its collection upon the respondent, but the argument will not serve to legalize the tax. A state cannot justify a burden on interstate commerce by laying a similar burden on local commerce. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Second. So far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, Iowa may lay a tax on any activity of the respondent which it pursues within the State but plainly, upon the facts disclosed, there is, in the conduct of respondent's mail order business, no such local activity. The Supreme Court of the State, 292 N.W. 130, 135, correctly found:\n'The sales are consummated outside the State of Iowa in each instance. They are separate and distinct from plaintiff's activities in Iowa. The statute here challenged seeks to impose upon plaintiff the obligation that it 'shall at the time of making such sales, whether within or without the state, collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the purchaser'. The sales are made outside of Iowa and the statute requires plaintiff to collect the tax at the time the sales are made. It clearly seeks to regulate activities of plaintiff outside the state. ... Under repeated pronouncements of the Supreme Court of the United States, hereinbefore reviewed and quoted from, the State of Iowa has no such right.' \n\n[312 \nU.S. 359, 372]\n\u00a0\n Delivery to a designated carrier is delivery to the customer13 and, in this case, is completed outside Iowa. The attempt, therefore, to impose a burden upon such delivery or to regulate the transaction is but an effort on the part of Iowa to regulate or tax an event which occurs outside her borders and over which she has no jurisdiction. \n14\n This court has recently enforced this principle in a case on its merits more favorable to the State's contention than the present. \n15\n There is was said:\n\n'It follows that such a tax, otherwise unconstitutional, is not converted into a valid exaction merely because the corporation enjoys outside the state economic benefits from transactions within it, which the state might but does not tax, or because the state might tax the transactions which the corporation carries on outside the state if it were induced to carry them on within.'\n\n McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Company, \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876, is distinguishable from the instant case for there the decision was grounded on the fact that the transfer of title and consummation of sale depended upon delivery by the seller in the taxing state.\n In this aspect also the power of the State does not extend to measures which condition respondent's privilege to do business in another state free from the regulation or taxation of Iowa. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Use Tax Act provides in  6943.103,\n'An excise tax is hereby imposed on the use in this state of tangible personal property purchased on or after the effective date of this chapter ( April 16, 1937) for use in this state, at the rate of two percent of the purchase price of such property. Said tax is hereby imposed upon every person using such property within this state until such tax has been paid directly to the county treasurer, to a retailer, or to the commission as hereinafter provided.'\n\n The sales tax is a two per cent tax on gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property sold at retail in the state to consumers or users.  6943.075. So far as material here the Use Tax need not be paid on property where a tax is required to be paid under the Sales Tax Act.  6943.104. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The retailer must also make quarterly returns.  6943.113. Penalties are imposed for delay in filing returns,  6943.118, for failure to do so or for failure to furnish data required by the commission.  6943. 120. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In 1937 respondent mailed to residents of Iowa about 600,000 small catalogues and 427,000 large ones. Respondent maintains 12 retail stores in Iowa, its investment therein exceeding $500,000. The aggregate sales of the retail stores in Iowa for 1936 amounted to $5,080,000; for 1937, $5, 600,000. Its mail order sales in Iowa for 1936 aggregated about $5,900,000; for 1937, about $5,400,000. It estimates that it has some 300,000 Iowa customers of its mail order houses and that in 1937 there were about 1,200, 000 orders received from Iowa customers.\n One of respondent's witnesses testified that the catalogues and bulletins mailed out were 'out sole means of securing' the mail order business. But he also testified, 'If a customer inquired from a clerk in the store as to whether or not he would have to pay a use tax upon an order, I believe the clerk would unform him that if he himself mailed the order that there would be no sales tax or use tax charged.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In Illinois respondent undertakes to collect the sales tax on mail orders from its Illinois customers. A notice and schedule of the tax for various amounts of orders are contained in the Illinois catalogue. It asserts that approximately 65% of those orders include an allowance for the tax. Where the orders are not accompanied by an amount covering the Illinois sales tax, respondent does not hold up the order but fills it and sends the customer a bill for the difference. It says that it collects approximately 36% of those deficiencies where the amount is less than 25\u00f5; 70% to 75%, where the amount is more. On the assumption that on sales to Iowa purchasers the use tax would amount to $100,000 a year, respondent asserts that based on its Illinois experience, the maximum that would be collected would be $68,000. To do that, it says, would entail a direct cost to it of approximately $13,700 a year. Those calculations are on the assumption that respondent would put a notice in its Iowa catalogues similar to the one used in Illinois. If such a notice were not given, it asserts that collections of the Iowa use tax would not exceed $35,000 (out of an assumed $100,000) and that its cost would be approximately $18,000. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Heyman v.

FRANK(1941)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1941\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 361]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. J. Donovan, of New York City, and John H. Agate, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellant.\n Mr. Louis J. Vorhaus, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, commonly known as the Nickel Plate Road, was organized in 1923 as a consolidated corporation under the laws of five states: New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The agreements and articles of consolidation provided that it should succeed to all of the properties and franchises, contracts, and obligations owned by its constituent companies. Section 143 of the New York Railroad Law, Consol. Laws, c. 49, under which the new corporation came into being, provided that 'all debts and liabili- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n ties incurred by either of such corporations shall thenceforth attach to such new corporation, and be enforced against it and its property to the same extent as if incurred or contracted by it.' \n1\n Among the constituent companies was the Lake Erie & Western Railroad. In connection with a lease of certain properties from the Northern Ohio Railway it had guaranteed payment of principal and interest upon the latter's bonds secured by mortgage on the leased property. Because of the contention that the state law 'attached' the obligations of this guaranty to the Nickel Plate, it has now been held liable upon defaulted coupons by a Municipal Court of the City of New York.\n The appellant defended on two grounds: First, that the original guaranty by the Lake Erie was ultra vires. This defense was overruled by the state court and nothing of that issue survives for our consideration. Second, that approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission was necessary under  20a of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  20a, before appellant legally could 'assume' the obligation2 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n and that such approval had not been given. This defense, too, was overruled by the state court, and this federal question comes here by appeal.\n In support of this defense the appellant set forth a letter, dated November 25, 1939, from the Secretary of the Interstate Commerce Commission which advised 'that the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company has never applied for, nor received authorization pursuant to section 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act to assume any obligation or liability as lessor, lessee, guarantor, endorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of bonds of the Northern Ohio Railway Company.' But it added that 'for further information I would refer' to a reported case in which the Commission had said: 'That the consolidation had the effect of transferring the guaranty of the Lake Erie to the Nickel Plate appears to be generally assumed by the parties to the reorganization proceeding ....' 3 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n This reference suggests an examination of the administrative history of the Nickel Plate consolidation and financing to learn what administrative application has been made of the statutes in question to the debt structure of this particular appellant.\n Shortly after its consolidation the appellant asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to certify under  1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1, that public convenience and necessity required the acquisition and operation by it of the railroad lines owned by the constituent companies. It also asked authority under  20a to issue preferred and common capital stocks in the amounts fixed by the agreements and articles of consolidation. It did not, however, ask under  5 of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  5, for approval of its consolidation. Acquisition and Stock Issue by New York, C. & St. L.R.R., 79 I.C.C. 581.\n This application required the Commission to construe the Transportation Act of 1920, which had recently introduced a wide range of innovations into the Interstate Commerce Act. Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920 directed the Commission to formulate 'as soon as practicable' a complete plan for the consolidation of the railways into a limited number of systems. As so amended,  5 also subjected voluntary consolidations to the ap- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 365]\n\u00a0\n proval of the Commission and required that they be approved if found, among other things, to be in harmony with such complete plan for general consolidation and if it appeared that the bonds of the consolidated corporations at par together with the outstanding capital stock at par would not exceed the value of the consolidated properties as determined by the Commission. By adding  20a the Transportation Act placed the issue of new securities and the assumption of obligations under the control of the Commission. The Act did not, however, provide for federal incorporation or for federal consolidation of carriers, but left the creation of new or consolidated corporations to state laws.\n At the time of the Nickel Plate's application for approval of its acquisition and operation of properties and the issue of its stock, the Commission had not completed its valuation of the constitutent companies nor adopted a complete plan of consolidation. The question arose, therefore, whether under the peculiarities of the statute the Commission was yet authorized to exercise any control over voluntary consolidations and the legal incidents and consequences thereof. On this question the Commission was divided in opinion. Commissioner Eastman, supported by Commissioners Esch and Hall, thought the amendment to  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act should be construed as being immediately effective to make any consolidation not approved by the Commission unlawful. Had such a view prevailed, the terms of the Nickel Plate consolidation would have been subject to scrutiny at that time. Each item of its debt would have been examined and approved or rejected, and its capital structure, including stock issue as well as debts, would have been tested by the valuation of its properties. The majority opinion, however, held that the Commission's approval under  5 was unnecessary. It stated: 'Applicable State laws afford means to effect the consolidation. Such laws \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n are in force. They are, in fact, the laws to which resort must be had to effectuate consolidations which the interstate commerce act is designed to facilitate. We can not conclude that they have been nullified or superseded. As valid existing laws we have no power to suspend them. Whether State corporations in matters regarding their status as legal entities as distinguished from their participation in interstate commerce may avail themselves of such laws does not depend upon our election or anything we do. Authority in us to withhold approval in the public interest of security issues when State laws permit consolidation does not mean that we may not grant approval when public interest requires that we do so. Furthermore, in the absence of mandatory provisions of a Federal statute we should give full faith and credit to the acts of sovereign States, especially when, as in this case, their action is unanimous.' 79 I. C.C., at pages 585, 586. The majority opinion added that the Act did not provide for 'compulsory consolidation', that such a provision had been 'considered by the Congress and rejected', and that accordingly 'it does not seem we should conclude that the Congress intended to prevent voluntary consolidations under available State laws in order thereby to force consolidation under such general plan as we may ultimately adopt.' 79 I.C.C., at page 586. It said that 'if the Congress had intended to suspend State laws until we should at some later time elect to permit their use, such intent would have been manifested in plain terms.' 79 I.C. C., at page 586. The majority of the Commission concluded that by virtue of the state proceedings and notwithstanding the lack of approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission 'all things necessary to the completion and consummation of the consolidation have been effected.' 79 I.C.C., at page 583.\n The Commission thereupon entered an order giving appellant its formal approval to the issue of new stock, including that to be exchanged share for share for upwards \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 367]\n\u00a0\n of $23,000,000 par value of the shares in the old Lake Erie Company subject to an agreement to contribute a relatively small part of it to the treasury of the new company, all as provided in the agreements and articles of consolidation.\n The Commission did not, in authorizing this stock issue, make any finding that such stock at par together with bonds at par did not exceed the value of the consolidated properties. It made no order approving assumption of any indebtedness of any kind. It appears that the appellant at that time sought no such authority. Appoaching maturity of some issues of bonds eventually forced it to take some corporate action, and upon such later occasions it sought and obtained authorization to extend maturity dates and in connection with such extensions to make an express assumption of liability as primary obligor.\n One of the constitutent companies-the old Nickel Plate-had outstanding at consolidation $16,381,000 of a bond issue dated October 1, 1887, maturing October 1, 1937. The assumption of this obligation was not approved until September 17, 1937, at which time the Commission approved a proposal to extend the maturity date for ten years and to assume obligation as primary obligor in respect of the extended bonds. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Bonds and Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 221 I. C.C. 772. The published reports of the Commission disclose two instances of similar approval of extension and assumption of primary liability with respect to bonds of the Lake Erie & Western outstanding at the date of consolidation, one as recent as June 7, 1941. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 217 I.C.C. 598; New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 247 I.C.C. 71.\n It does not appear that either the Nickel Plate or the Commission questioned the Nickel Plate's obligation to pay either interest or principal of the debts of the con- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 368]\n\u00a0\n stitutent companies, although for long periods after the consolidation they were without the Commission's approval. Instead, the Commission has indicated that it regarded the state law as adequate to attach liability to the new company for such debts. In 1923, shortly after the consolidation, the Nickel Plate applied under  20a of the Interstate Commerce Act to endorse its guaranty of payment upon certain bonds to be issued by a constituent company, and the premise upon which relief was granted was stated by the Commission: 'It appears that the consolidation was completed on April 11, 1923, and that the new company is now vested with the property, rights, and franchises of the Nickel Plate and other constituent companies, subject to all their debts, obligations, and liabilities.' (Italics supplied.) New York, C. & St. L.R.R. Bonds, 82 I.C. C. 365, 366. The following year, in dealing with another constitutent company, the Commission defined the status of this appellant as follows: The applicant is the successor, by consolidation, of the Toledo, St. Louis & Western Railroad Company and other companies, and by virtue of such consolidation has acquired all property, rights, and powers, and has assumed all obligations of the Toledo, St. Louis & Western Railroad Company.' (Italics supplied.) Pledge of Toledo, St. Louis & Western Bonds by New York, C. & St. L.R.R., 86 I.C.C. 465.\n The Commission, as well as appellant, as recently as 1938 gave unmistakable recognition to the validity of the guaranty on which appellee has recovered. This appears from the reorganization proceedings under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  205, involving the properties of the Northern Ohio, the original obligor whose payments were guaranteed by appellant's constituent company, the Lake Erie & Western. The Commission stated that: 'From the consolidation of the Lake Erie & Western with the New York, Chicago & St. Louis, resulting liability of the latter on the Lake Erie's guaranty of the Northern's bonds thus is ap- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 369]\n\u00a0\n parently admitted.' (Italics supplied.)4 Upon that premise the Commission made allowance in the plan of reorganization for the indemnification of the appellant because, if required to make good on the guaranty, it would become subrogated to the rights of the Northern Ohio bondholders as a mortgage creditor and would become a general creditor in the amount of any deficiency. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 370]\n\u00a0\n We draw the following conclusions from this history of the Nickel Plate's experience before the Interstate Commerce Commission:\n By its decision in Acquisition and Stock Issue by New York, C. & St. L.R.R., 79 I.C.C. 581, the Commission adopted the construction of the Transportation Act which the Nickel Plate urged upon it and held itself precluded from supervision of the consolidation under  5. This Court subsequently approved that construction in Snyder v. New York, C. & St. L. R. Co., 118 Ohio St. 72, 160 N.E. 615; Id., \n278 \nU.S. 578\n, 49 S.Ct. 176, holding that the Nickel Plate had the rights of a de jure corporation notwithstanding its failure to have its creation by consolidation approved by the Commission, on the ground that the consolidation took place at a time when  5 had 'not as yet become applicable.'\n It seems clear that the Commission applied a like construction of its powers under  20a over the assumption of the debts and liabilities of the constituent companies. That it deliberately deferred to a later day consideration of all debts seems the correct inference from its express \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 371]\n\u00a0\n caveat that 'Nothing in this report shall be construed as restricting the commission in its action with respect to the promulgation of a complete consolidation plan or upon the subject of valuation.' 79 I.C.C., at page 585. Even apart from this caveat, it is clear that the Commission's failure at this time to make either order or investigation with reference to any debts or liabilities was due to no delusion that the Nickel Plate was being launched as a debt-free railroad. It was a matter of common knowledge that the constituent companies were heavily in debt for which no provision had been made other than by attachment to the new corporation under state law. This and the resulting burden of fixed charges on the revenues of the new company were well known to the Commission. \n5\n The disappearance of all debt from consideration by the Commission cannot be accounted for except on the ground that the Commission held itself without jurisdiction to deal with it until the company should propose some action of its own, such as extension, endorsement, or issue of sub- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 372]\n\u00a0\n stitute securities-as distinguished from the effect of the law of consolidation on the fact of pre-existing debts. That such was the holding is further indicated by the Commission's subsequent handling of the obligations of the constituent companies.\n Whether we would agree with the Commission's interpretation of the Act as an original matter, it is not necessary to decide. Considerations of public interest certainly should have weighed heavily in favor of the Commission, had it asserted power to review the debts of the new company before giving even tentative and formal approval to capitalization of its equity. What we must now decide is the present effect of the Commission's interpretation of its powers as to the indebtedness of this particular appellant, woven as it has been, by a series of actions by the Commission, into the whole financial fabric of this important carrier system. We are now asked blindly to unravel we know not what by reversing a consistent and long-standing interpretation of  20a by the administrative body to which its enforcement was committed. \n6\n We are asked to do this to the enrichment of a stockholder equity which itself was capitalized with no thorough scrutiny by virtue of the same interpretation. We are asked to do this \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 373]\n\u00a0\n although the Commission with knowledge of the claim of illegality has set aside securities in the Akron reorganization to compensate it in some measure and has made no effort to enjoin the Nickel Plate from using its revenues to satisfy in part at least the claims of these bondholders.\n Under the circumstances of this case the administrative interpretation on which the Commission has acted in its long course of dealing with Nickel Plate affairs should not be upset. United States v. Chicago, North Shore & M.R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 1\n, 53 S.Ct. 245.\n The judgment appealed from is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n While I agree with the opinion of the Court, I think an elaboration of the point, which is the nub of the case, is desirable in view of certain observations in the dissenting opinion.\n Appellant is a corporation formed under  141 of New York Railroad Law which provides for consolidation of railroad corporations. On the filing of the articles or agreement of consolidation, the several constituent companies 'shall be one corporation by the name provided in such agreement'. And  141 also provides that 'such act of consolidation shall not release such new corporation from any of the restrictions, liabilities or duties of the several corporations so consolidated.' By  143 all debts of the constituent companies 'shall thenceforth attach to such new corporation, and be enforced against it and its property to the same extent as if incurred or contracted by it.' We are pointed to no provision of the New York law which would permit the creation of the new consolidated corporation without the attachment of the debts of the constituent companies.\n Snyder v. New York, Chicago & St. Louis R.R. Co., 118 Ohio St. 72, 160 N.E. 615, affirmed \n278 \nU.S. 578\n, 49 S.Ct. 176, held that authority from \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 374]\n\u00a0\n the Commission was not necessary to create this consolidated corporation. A necessary and inherent incident of its creation was the attachment of these obligations. Hence, I do not see how we can say that although authority from the Commission was not necessary to create appellant, such authority was necessary in order for this consolidated corporation to meet the requirements which the New York law exacted as conditions to its creation. But if we held that an attachment of liability under the New York Consolidation Act was an 'assumption' of liability within the meaning of  20a, we would be doing just that. Hence, I feel forced to conclude that in case of this type of consolidation 'assumption' in  20a does not include attachment of liability by virtue of the filing of articles of consolidation under a state statute, though it would of course include the issuance of any security or the incurrence or extension of any obligation subsequent to consolidation. Such is one consequence of the failure to follow Commissioner Eastman's views in Acquisition and Stock Issue of New York, C. & St. L.R.R., 79 I.C.C. 581. But I do not see how in all fairness we can reopen at this late stage the unfortunate decision in the Snyder case.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be reversed, but without prejudice to any right of appellee to recover under  20a(11) of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n I am not now prepared to say that appellee could not have recovered under the provisions of  20a(11) had counsel seen fit to present the question for decision. \n1\n But \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 375]\n\u00a0\n the only question which they have briefed and argued here is whether  20a( 2) precludes the imposition of the asserted liability upon appellant where, as is the case here, its assumption by appellant has not been approved by order of the Commission as required by that section. The Court avoids decision of this question by declaring that the Commission has declined to give its approval because it has construed  20a(2) as inapplicable and that we are bound by that construction.\n Examination of the Commission's opinions and orders from which the Court draws its cryptic answer to the question before us makes it plain that the Commission has placed no such construction on the statute in any case, and that in the cases cited relating to the Nickel Plate consolidation it has never had any occasion to construe  20a(2). On the contrary, in several cases, the Commission has construed  20a(2) as applicable to obligations like the present, which 'attach' by operation of state law to the acquisition by the carrier of the property of other roads, and in conformity to that section has approved the 'assumption' of such liability by the carrier.\n In the cases before the Commission on which the Court relies it appears that the Commission was not asked to pass upon the question now before us and did not purport to pass upon it. The opinion of the Court thus rests on no more substantial basis than the circumstance that the Commission has acted favorably on an application of ap- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 376]\n\u00a0\n pellant to be permitted to operate the consolidated lines and to issue securities in conformity to the plan of consolidation, in a proceeding in which the Commission was neither asked to take nor took any action with respect to assumption of liabilities; and this under a statutory scheme of control which plainly contemplates that a consolidation may go into effect without adoption of its assumption of liability feature, which in any case can become operative only by order of the Commission approving it upon application and on findings that the public interest will be served. Rock Island System Consolidation, 193 I.C.C. 395, 403, 404; Acquisition of Lines and Stock Issue by Pennsylvania, O. & D.R.R., 105 I.C.C. 189, 193. The Court infers the Commission's refusal to approve the assumption of liability for want of jurisdiction from the silence and inaction of the Commission when it was not called upon to speak or to act either by the statute or by any application pending before it.\n Section 20a(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act contains two prohibitions. One is imposed on the issuance of securities by railroads without approval of the Commission. The other makes it unlawful for such a carrier to assume any obligation in respect of securities issued by others 'even though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the carrier, and after investigation by the commission of the purposes and uses of ... the proposed assumption of obligation ... the commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption.' The statute commands with particularity that 'The commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 377]\n\u00a0\n its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose.'\n It will be noted that there is no requirement of the statute that applications for the acquisition of other roads or for the approval of security issues, and applications for approval of the assumption of guarantee obligations, shall be united in a single proceeding. Indeed it is clear that the statute leaves the Commission free to approve the one and reject an application for the other. And it appears that the uniform practice of the Commission has been, as the statute directs, to entertain neither, except on an application asking the desired approval. And where more than one is asked, the Commission has by its order separately dealt with those upon which it intended to act. E.g., Acquisition of Chesapeake & O. Northern Ry. Co. by Chesapeake & O. Ry., 70 I.C.C. 550; Gainesville Midland Reorganization, 131 I.C.C. 355; Control of Greenbrier, Cheat & Elk R.R., 131 I.C.C. 525; Chicago, M. St. p. & P.R. Co. Acquisition, 158 I.C.C. 770; Elmira & L.O.R. Co. Acquisition, 170 I.C.C. 127.\n The Commission has pointed out that its action in passing on applications under each of the paragraphs 18 to 20 inclusive, of  1, or under  5(2), of the Act is limited to the particular provision of the Act on which the application is founded, and is not to be construed as a decision on any other provision. See Acquisition of Line by Oklahoma City S.I. Ry., 86 I.C.C. 273, 274; Acquisition by Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 138 I.C.C. 787, 789; Acquisition by St. Louis-S.F. Ry., 145 I.C.C. 110, 114; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Reorganization, 131 I.C.C. 673, 691, 692; New York Central R. Co. Assumption, 158 I.C.C. 317, 320-323; Pacific Coast R. Co. Acquisition, 187 I.C.C. 563 and Pacific Coast R. Co. Securities, 189 I.C.C. 79. Cf. Keeshin Transcon. Freight Lines, Inc.-Debentures, 5 M.C. C. 349, 351. In fact, the Commission has said that  20a(2) 'confers upon us power to grant or deny authority to issue securities or to assume obligation or liability ... only upon ap- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 378]\n\u00a0\n plication by the carrier for such authority'. New York Central R. Co. Assumption, 158 I.C.C. 317, 322.\n In the Commission's view authority to consolidate includes the authority to acquire and operate properties of other roads, but neither that authority nor the authority to issue securities upon consolidation includes authority to assume liabilities of the constituent companies. Rock Island System Consolidation, 193 I.C.C. 395, 403, 404; Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.-Merger, 5 M.C.C. 324, 328; cf. Illinois Terminal R. Co. Consolidation and Securities, 221 I.C.C. 676. The Court's suggestion that this was not so before the Commission promulgated its general plan of consolidation under  5, is contrary to the ruling in Acquisition & Stock Issue by Pennsylvania O. & D.R.R., 105 I.C.C. 189. In that case, before the promulgation of the plan, the Commission was at pains to warn (page 193 of 105 I.C.C.) that its approval of an issue of securities to carry out a consolidation under state law did not involve any decision on assumption of liability of the obligations of the consolidated company's constituents. Assumption of Obligation by Lake Superior & I.R.R., 86 I.C.C. 640, and Grand Trunk W.R. Co. Unification and Securities, 158 I.C.C. 117, 138, 142, 143, both decided before the promulgation of the plan, granted permission to assume the obligations of the constituents and thus gives further proof that the Commission, when it intended to take any position with respect to the assumption of obligations in connection with a consolidation, did so by action affirmatively expressed rather than by silence.\n The Commission has entertained applications for the approval under  1 of the Act of the operation of acquired properties or for approval of security issues upon consolidation without any application for the approval of the assumption of the liabilities involved. See Acquisition and Stock Issue by New York, C. & St. L.R.R., 79 I.C.C. 581; Pacific Coast R. Co. Acquisition, 187 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 379]\n\u00a0\n I.C.C. 563; cf. Rock Island System Consolidation, 193 I.C.C. 395, 403, 404. And in the case of this appellant, as of other roads, it has later entertained and disposed of separate applications for the approval of the assumption of the obligations involved. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co., Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 217 I.C.C. 598; New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Bonds and Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 221 I.C.C. 772; New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 247 I. C.C. 71; St. Louis-S.F. Readjustment, 145 I.C.C. 218; Pacific Coast R. Co. Securities, 189 I.C.C. 79; Cincinnati Union Term. Co. Securities, 166 I.C. C. 419; Id., 166 I.C.C. 499; Id., 184 I.C.C. 619; West Jersey & S.R. Co. Bonds, 217 I.C.C. 125; cf. Assumption of Obligation by New Orleans, T. & M. Ry., 94 I.C.C. 218.\n Such action by the Commission plainly precludes any inference that in approving an application for the operation of the consolidated lines or an issue of securities under a consolidation, it was doing more than responding to the petition presented to it or that it was undertaking to pass on the legality or propriety of the assumption by the consolidated road of guarantee obligations of its constituent companies. We are pointed to nothing suggesting that the Commission has ever regarded such approvals as involving an unasked determination with respect to the assumption by the consolidated carrier of the obligation of its constituent companies.\n There is thus no plausible ground for saying that there was lurking in the Commission's decision in 79 I.C.C. 581 some implied ruling as to the construction of  20a(2) and some implied refusal to act because of that construction in a situation in which it was not asked or expected to act and in which, for reasons already stated, it was under no duty to act. In none of the cases cited in the opinion of the Court as hinting at a possible construction by the Commission of  20a(2) was it asked to make any finding or order with respect to the assumption by appellant of obligations of its constituent companies. In none did it make or decline to make any of the findings or the order required by  20a(2) with respect to such obligations. In none did it express any opinion whether obligations attaching to a consolidated carrier are within the prohibition of the statute, or as to its duty to approve or disapprove of their assumption.\n In Operation of Lines and Issue of Capital Stock by the New York, C. & St. L.R.R. Co., 79 I.C.C. 581, the Commission was asked to and did specifically approve the opera- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 380]\n\u00a0\n tion by appellant of the consolidated line and the issuance of certain stock by appellant, pursuant to the consolidation plan, and nothing more. It made no mention of any assumption of obligation by appellant or of the assumption provisions of  20a(2). It neither took nor declined to take action affecting such assumption. For all that appears the Commission in its examination of the capital structure and the balance sheet of appellant may have disregarded the guarantee obligation as one not affecting the consolidated company because its assumption had not been approved by the Commission.\n It construed the consolidation provisions in  5 of the Act as permitting carriers to consolidate under state law without first securing the Commission's authorization for the consolidation itself. Whether or not this was the necessary interpretation of the consolidation provisions, cf. Snyder v. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 578\n, 49 S.Ct. 176, nothing in the report of the Commission's decision suggests that if it was essential, in order to carry out the consolidation under state law, that obligations be 'assumed', then the assumption could be accomplished without compliance with  20a(2). Its decision is in fact inconsistent with any such theory, and affords affirmative evidence that the Commission thought  20a(2) \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 381]\n\u00a0\n was operative notwithstanding the narrow interpretation which it gave to  5.\n The Commission authorized appellant to issue, under  20a(2), certain preferred and common stock, to be exchanged for the stock of its five constituent companies in carrying out the consolidation. If consolidations under state law could, in the Commission's view, be effected at that time wholly without regard to  20a(2), then the granting of authority to issue the stock would have been superfluous. That the Commission deemed such authority necessary is persuasive that it regarded  20a(2) as applicable to all issues of securities, or assumptions of obligations, which occurred in connection with a consolidation. Freedom to consolidate, in the Commission's view, plainly did not include freedom to make adjustments in capital structure without the authorization required by  20a(2). Hence the only real question is whether an obligation assumed or attaching merely by operation of law is an 'assumption' within the meaning of  20a( 2)-a question which as will presently appear the Commission has consistently answered in the affirmative whenever it has been called upon to give an answer.\n Subsequent proceedings before the Commission affecting appellant, in the cases on which the Court relies, presented no question of its liability upon the guarantee obligations of its constituent companies and are equally barren of any indication that the Commission considered the meaning and application of the assumption provisions of  20a(2) or that it had any occasion to do so. In New York, C. & St. L.R.R. Bonds, 82 I.C.C. 365, and in Pledge of Bonds by New York, C. & St. L.R.R., 86 I.C.C. 465, next cited by the Court as sustaining its decision, the questions presented to the Commission had not even a remote relation to any assumption by appellant of guarantee obligations, resulting from the consolidation, which the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 382]\n\u00a0\n Commission had not by its order approved. In the one case the application was for authority to make a new bond issue; in the other for permission to pledge some of its own assets to secure a new note issue. Passing references by the Commission, in recounting the history of the consolidation, to the fact that appellant had acquired the properties of constituent companies 'subject to all their debts, obligations, and liabilities' and that it 'has assumed all obligations' of a different constituent company from that here involved, can hardly be accepted as evidence of an unasked administrative construction of a provision of a statute which it was not administering and with respect to which it expressed no opinion.\n The Court gains no support for its conclusion from the supposed recognition by the Commission in the Akron case that the 'resulting liability' from appellant's consolidation had been 'apparently admitted'. Akron, C. & Y. Ry. Co. & Northern O. Ry. Co. Reorganization, 228 I.C.C. 645, 647. The bankruptcy reorganization, whose approval by the Commission was there sought, was that of the Northern Ohio Railway, the guarantee of whose bonds is presently involved. What had 'apparently' been 'admitted' by the proposed reorganization was that so far as appellant should perform or be compelled to perform the guarantee, it would become a creditor of the new company, entitled to participate in the new securities to be issued to creditors under the reorganization. The only action taken by the Commission with respect to the obligation was to approve (page 673 of 228 I.C.C.) the provision of the plan, which reserved new securities of the reorganized company for the satisfaction of appellant's claim 'pending performance', if any, of the guarantee, by appellant, and to order (page 684 of 228 I.C.C.) the reorganized company to issue to appellant its proportion of the new securities upon 'appropriate proof' by appellant 'of loss sustained in the performance of its contract of guarantee'. The Commission thus had no oc- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 383]\n\u00a0\n casion to determine the question which appellant asks to have determined here, and pointedly left it undecided. Obviously the approved plan gave appellant a powerful incentive to resist performance of the guarantee and manifestly did not purport to foreclose appellant from securing the adjudication of the liability which it seeks here.\n Not only do these cases fail to disclose any self-denying construction of  20a(2) by the Commission, but in others where the Commission has been called on to consider the question it has taken the position that the word 'assumption' in  20a(2) includes an obligation placed upon the carrier merely by operation of the state law under which it had acquired property.\n Three times since its decision in 79 I.C.C. 581, the Commission has granted the application of appellant to be permitted to extend and also to assume obligations of its constituent companies. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 217 I.C.C. 598; New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Bonds and Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 221 I.C.C. 772; New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 247 I.C.C. 71. In two of these cases, the Commission authorized appellant to assume obligations of the Lake Erie & Western-the same constituent company whose obligation is now said to have been assumed without the necessity of the Commission's authorization. If appellant was already personally liable on the obligations, permission to assume them was unnecessary. And since the Commission does not entertain applications for authority to assume obligations where it is of the opinion that the obligation is not one to which  20a(2) applies, Southern Pacific Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 189 I.C.C. 212, 213; Bonds of Arkansas & M. Railway Bridge & Term. Co., 94 I.C.C. 79, 81; Missouri-K.-T. R. Co. Assumption of Obligation, 212 I.C.C. 217; Pittsburgh & Shawmut R. Co. Securities, 166 I.C.C. 503, 505, it action in authorizing the assumptions, in addition to the extensions, is inconsistent with any in- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 384]\n\u00a0\n ference on our part that it had previously ruled that the obligations assumed were not required to comply with  20a(2).\n On the contrary, the Commission applied that section to obligations like the present soon after enactment of the Transportation Act of 1920. In Assumption of Obligation by Hudson River Connecting R.R., 72 I.C.C. 595, decided nine months before its decision in 79 I.C.C. 581, the Commission took jurisdiction of an application for approval of an assumption of obligation resulting by operation of New York law from a carrier's acquisition of property. In granting the application and in authorizing the carrier to 'assume' the attached obligation the Commission stated, at page 596 of 72 I.C.C.:\n'While the applicant does not propose to make any indorsement on the bonds, or execute any agreement in respect of the payment of them, it appears that, under the laws of New York, the acceptance of a deed conveying land subject to a mortgage indebtedness, which the grantee agrees to assume, has the effect of making the land the primary fund for the payment of the mortgage indebtedness, so that the grantee becomes the principal debtor and the grantor a surety'.\n\n The Commission made the findings prescribed by  20a(2) and ordered that the applicant be 'authorized to assume obligation and liability' in respect of the mortgaged bonds, 'said assumption of obligation and liability ... to be accomplished by the acceptance by the applicant of a deed of said lands'.\n More recently, in Public Service Coordinated Transport-Assumption of Obligation, 15 M.C.C. 406, a motor carrier case under  214 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  314, which incorporates by reference  20a(2), the Commission reaffirmed its earlier construction of  20a(2) as applying to obligations like the present, saying (p. 408): \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 385]\n\u00a0\n 'Prior to consummation of the merger, applicant's liability in respect of the bonds of said companies was of a contingent nature. Under the statutes of New Jersey all debts and liabilities of merged or consolidated corporations shall thenceforth attach to the consolidated corporation and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts and liabilities had been incurred or contracted by it. Thus, through completion of said merger, applicant has, by operation of law, become the principal obligor in respect of these bonds, and, as such, has obligations and liabilities in respect thereof which differ from the contingent liability previously existent. In our opinion assumption of such obligations and liabilities as successor in title is a matter over which we have jurisdiction.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n While courts are not necessarily bound by the Commission's construction of the Interstate Commerce Act, Mitchell v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 80\n, 61 S.Ct. 873; United States v. Chicago, etc., R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 311\n, 51 S.Ct. 159, they rightly pay deference to the Commission's considered construction of it, especially when it is of long standing and has \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 386]\n\u00a0\n never been departed from. But it is novel doctrine that a provision of an act of Congress may be nullified by a construction of the Interstate Commerce Commission which can be inferred only from the fact that the Commission ignored the provision in a proceeding in which, by its settled practice, it was not called upon to construe or apply it. Certainly the Commission does not appear ever to have acted upon any such view, nor has it come before us to advocate it. It seems plain that the rulings of the Commission that  20a(2) is applicable to those obligations which state law attaches to the carrier in consequence of its participation in a consolidation, as well as to those which attach to it by reason of its expressed promise, carry out the purposes of the statute and are consistent with its language. Section 20a(2) was enacted to prevent the imposition on the railroads of the country, through consolidation or otherwise, personal liability for the obligations of other roads, such as had occurred in certain well known consolidations notorious for their disregard of the interests of security holders and the public. See 58 Cong. Rec. 8317-18. As the effective means of prevention it prescribed that all such obligations should be void, unless the Commission orders their approval as compatible with the public interest.\n But even if we assume that the silence of the Commission in 79 I.C.C. 581 can be taken to intimate a view of the meaning of  20a(2), with respect to which it took no action and made no order, it seems still more novel to say that such an inference must control our decision here in the face of its explicit construction of the statute in other cases as applicable to situations like the present. Even sporadic and inconsistent administrative decisions, where the parties have relied upon them, may sometimes both be followed by courts when applied to those parties. But the unarticulated intimations of opinion of an administrative body, unacted upon, are too inconclusive \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 387]\n\u00a0\n to control judicial decision. Courts are not like weathercocks, changing with every administrative wind that blows. They cannot on the same day rightly decide that the same statute means different things in different cases, merely because the Commission may on different days have had shifting impressions which it has not thought sufficiently important to express in any ruling, opinion, decision or order.\n United States v. Chicago North Shore & M.R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 1\n, 53 S.Ct. 245, upon which the Court relies, has no significance here. It is one thing to accept judicially the Commission's decision that a particular carrier is an 'interurban electric railway', a determination unquestionably within its power and peculiarly within its administrative competence. It is quite another to bind the courts by a construction of the statute which the Commission has never voiced but which, on the contrary, it has consistently denied, namely, that obligations may be assumed without conscious and express permission of the Commission and in defiance of the declared will of Congress.\n It is impossible to believe that the all-inclusive provisions of  20a(2), passed in response to a general and long-felt need for the federal regulation of railroad capitalization, were intended to exclude assumptions of obligations which attach by virtue of state law. The statute makes  20a(2) subject only to one exception-short-term notes maturing in not more than two years,  20a(9)-and even in that instance the carrier is required to file with the Commission a certificate of notification. No other exception was provided, and it is apparent that none was intended. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 388]\n\u00a0\n We are not concerned here with doubts whether appellant is validly organized under New York law. No such issue is presented by the record. The only question before \n\n[314 \nU.S. 360, 389]\n\u00a0\n us is whether personal liability can be assumed by appellant without complying with the statute, which makes such an assumption void 'even though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation' 'unless and until, and then only to the extent that' the Commission has approved the assumption after making the prescribed findings.\n The statute does not deprive the holders of obligations of the constituent companies of any rights against them or their property. It only prevents the acquisition by such holders, contrary to the public interest, of new rights against the consolidated carrier without the consent of the Commission, and by  20a(11) the statute gives a remedy to those who like appellee become innocent purchasers of such securities, after consolidation, for the loss of such rights through the operation of  20a(2). The application of the statute in this case no more involves enriching stockholder equities than in any other. The question in every case is whether the public, and railroad security holders, shall be burdened, through repeated reorganizations of railroads, with excessive indebtedness which it was the purpose of the statute to prohibit. It is obvious that the statute would fail of its proclaimed purpose unless, as the Commission has ruled, its prohibitions extend to those obligations which the consolidated carrier assumes by virtue of its entering into a consolidation under state law, as well as those which it assumes by its expressed promise. The words of the statute neither compel nor persuade to the decision now given, which seems to rest on nothing more substantial than a far-fetched surmise. It defeats the Congressional purpose and conflicts with the legislative history and administrative construction of the statute.\n Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice BYRNES join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The complete text of  143 of the New York Railroad Law was as follows:\n'The rights of all creditors of, and all liens upon the property of, either of such corporations, parties to such agreement and act, shall be preserved unimpaired, and the respective corporations shall be deemed to continue in existence to preserve the same, and all debts and liabilities incurred by either of such corporations shall thenceforth attach to such new corporation, and be enforced against it and its property to the same extent as if incurred or contracted by it. No actions or proceedings in which either of such corporations is a party shall abate or be discontinued by such agreement and act of consolidation, but may be conducted to final judgment in the names of such corporations, or such new corporation may be, by order of the court, on motion substituted as a party.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n]  20a(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act provided that:\n'It shall be unlawful for any carrier to issue any share of capital stock or any bond or other evidence of interest in or indebtedness of the carrier (hereinafter in this section collectively termed 'securities') or to assume any obligation or liability as lessor, lessee, guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise, in respect of the securities of any other person, natural or artificial, even though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the carrier, and after investigation by the commission of the purposes and uses of the proposed issue and the proceeds thereof, or of the proposed assumption of obligation or liability in respect of the securities of any other person, natural or artificial, the commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption. The commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Akron, C. & Y. Ry. Co. & Northern O. Ry. Co. Reorganization, 236 I. C.C. 214, 216, 217.\n Compare the following, from a letter written by the Director of the Commission to one Zinman, dated March 19, 1940, referring to the Nickel Plate guaranty on the Northern Ohio bonds, and appearing in the Commission's file in Acquisition and Stock Issue by New York, C. & St. L.R. R., 79 I.C.C. 581:\n'As to the matter of assumption of obligation and liability in respect of the securities of others, it is our understanding that no authority was sought nor granted in connection with the application recorded under the above Finance Docket number. It is our further understanding that the consolidated company took the properties, rights, and franchises of the constituent companies, subject to all their debts, obligations, and liabilities, such as might be imposed by the consolidation statutes of the states of the constituent companies. See ( New York, Chicago & St. Louis R.R. Bonds) 82 I.C.C. 365 (366).' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Akron, C. & Y. Ry. Co. and Northern O. Ry. Co. Reorganization, 228 I.C.C. 645, 647.\n The plan approved by the Commission provided:\n'Appropriate securities of the new company as hereinafter noted, consistent with the other provisions of the plan, with which to recompense the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Company for the debtor's and the intervening debtor's liability to it for amounts expended in the performance of its guaranty of the first-mortgage bonds of the intervening debtor, shall be issued and held in treasury.' 228 I.C.C., at pages 679, 680. Also, 'The New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company, upon presentation to the treasurer of the new company of appropriate proof of loss sustained in the performance of its contract of guaranty of bonds of the intervening debtor, shall receive of the new company stock issued in reorganization and held in treasury, for each $100 of loss so proved, $22. 79, par value, of new common stock; and shall participate equally and ratably with the holders of class A warrants in any distribution of stock pursuant thereto, each $100 of proved loss entitling the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company to participate in the distribution to the same extent as one class A warrant.' 228 I.C.C., at pages 681, 682.\n\n The true inwardness of these provisions of the reorganization plan appears from the opinion:\n'The New York, Chicago & St. Louis should be treated as though having a claim equal to the losses it will sustain in the performance of its guaranty. The mathematical maximum of this claim would be equal to the principal of the outstanding Northern bonds plus the four years of overdue interest thereon, or $3,000,000. The probable maximum would be very much less, but cannot be determined on any definite basis. Securities should accordingly be reserved pending performance of the New York, Chicago & St. Louis guaranty on the basis of its having a $3,000,000 claim.' 228 I.C.C., at page 673.\n\n The securities, however, thus set aside to the Nickel Plate were to come back to others 'as may be made possible through the New York, Chicago & St. Louis settling with the Northern bondholders, or otherwise discharging its liabilities, for less than the maximum ....' 228 I.C.C., at pages 673, 674.\n An effort was apparently made to get rid of this obligation, in part at least, in the reorganization; but the Commission held that this guaranty ran to each Northern bondholder individually, and that the Nickel Plate could not deal with the bondholders as a class, on the ground that there appeared to be no provision in  77 'for enforcing on all in lieu of the guaranty a compromise that may be agreeable to a majority but not acceptable to a minority, and no provision for discharging in these proceedings the New York, Chicago & St. Louis, a solvent obligor able to meet its debts as they mature, from any of its obligations. It follows that a provision in a plan of reorganization of the debtors, pursuant to section 77, releasing the guaranty, would be of such doubtful validity as to require our disapproval, and that settlements for this guaranty should be made separately from the plan of reorganization ....' 228 I.C.C., at page 667. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The application of the Nickel Plate asked authority to issue 327, 200 shares of preferred stock and 462,479 shares of common stock to be exchanged share for share for the stocks of the constituent companies. It included a general balance sheet of each constituent company and a consolidated balance sheet showing long-term debts of the constituent companies aggregating $78,897,000, which items and exact amounts were carried into the consolidated balance sheet.\n The Lake Erie & Western Railroad Company was shown to have outstanding capital stocks with a par value of $23,680,000, $13,895,600 of long-term debt, and $4,996,944 of 'deferred liabilities.' The stock was replaced with a like amount of stock in the new company, and the debt and 'deferred liabilities' were carried in full into the consolidated balance sheet under the same headings. The obligation in suit was not specified; perhaps it was included in 'deferred liabilities.'\n A Stockholders' Protective Committee of the Old Nickel Plate filed objections to the plan of consolidation, one of the grounds of which was the alleged assumption of a heavy bond indebtedness ahead of the stock, and complaint was specifically made of the indebtedness of the Lake Erie & Western. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This interpretation is not inconsistent with the Commission's practice in other cases. Assumption of Obligation by Hudson River Connecting R.R., 72 I.C.C. 595, dealt with assumption of liability on a mortgage which the applicant had agreed to assume as part of the purchase price of a piece of land. It had no connection with any consolidation proceeding. Rock Island System Consolidation, 193 I.C.C. 395, was decided after amendment of  5 by the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act approved June 16, 1933, 49 U.S.C.A.  5. The Commission had by the time of that decision promulgated a plan of consolidation, and it found that the Rock Island consolidation would be 'in harmony with and in furtherance of the plan.' 193 I.C.C., at page 403. It was the absence of such a plan that defeated jurisdiction of the Commission to approve the Nickel Plate consolidation. Snyder v. New York, C. & St. L.R.R., supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 U.S.C.  20a(11), 49 U.S.C.A.  20a(11), after providing that assumptions of obligations not approved by the Commission are void, declares:\n'If ... any security in respect to which the assumption of obligation or liability is so made void, is acquired by any person for value and in good faith and without notice that the ... assumption is void, such person may in a suit or action in any court of competent jurisdiction hold jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the damage sustained by him in respect thereof, the carrier which ... assumed the obligation or liability so made void, and its directors, officers, attorneys, and other agents, who participated in any way ... in the authorizing of the assumption of the obligation or liability so made void.'\n\n It appears from the record, in an affidavit upon which summary judgment was granted, that in 1936, after the consolidation, appellee purchased the bonds from a broker for value 'without notice of any defense thereto or to the guarantee thereof.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also Elmira & L.O.R. Co. Acquisition, 170 I.C.C. 127, where the Commission approved an 'assumption' of liability which was apparently to attach (see page 128 of 170 I.C.C.) solely by operation of the New York stock corporation laws. Cf. Assumption of Obligation by Lake Superior & I. R.R., 86 I.C.C. 640, where in authorizing as 'assumption' the Commission stated: 'Under the agreement and the laws of Michigan the debts, liabilities, and duties of the last two companies named attach to the applicant and are enforceable against it to the same extent and in the same manner as if originally incurred by it. The applicant accordingly seeks authority to assume obligation and liability in respect of the securities of these companies.' Cf. also Union R. Co. Assumption of Obligation and Liability, 217 I.C.C. 635, where, in authorizing an assumption the Commission stated: 'Pursuant to the terms of the joint agreement of merger dated October 1, 1936, and the provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the applicant will assume all the debts and obligations of the' constituent corporations. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Examination of the historical background of  20a can leave no genuine doubt that the financial provisions of  20a(2) were meant to be all-inclusive. Abuses in railroad financing had been a continuous subject of public concern. See the report of the Windom Committee in 1874, S.Rep. No. 307, 43rd Cong., 1st Sess., Vol. I, pp. 71-76; the report of the Cullom Committee in 1886, S.Rep.No. 46, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., part I, pp. 51-52. In 1907 the Interstate Commerce Commission, reporting upon its investigation of the Union Pacific and the Chicago & Alton railroads, recommended federal regulation of security issues. In re Consolidations and Combinations of Carriers, 12 I.C.C. 277; and see, also, the Commission's Annual Report for 1907, p. 24. In 1910 President Taft urged upon Congress federal regulation of railroad securities, 45 Cong.Rec. 380, but the Senate's opposition prevented the proposal from being included in the Mann-Elkins Act. In 1913 the Commission concluded its New England Investigation, 27 I.C.C. 560, 616, with the recommendation that 'No interstate railroad should be permitted to lease or purchase any other railroad, nor to acquire the stocks or securities of any other railroad, nor to guarantee the same, directly or indirectly, without the approval of the federal government.' Senate opposition again proved too strong in 1914, as well as in 1916, but by the end of the war opposition to the regulation of railroad capitalization practically disappeared. See Locklin, Regulation of Security Issues by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pp. 12-22; Sharfman, The Interstate Commerce Commission, Vol. I, pp. 86-94, 189-93; and the Commission's Annual Report for 1919, pp. 4-5. \n Section 20a when finally enacted was thus a thoroughgoing reform, long considered and at last virtually unopposed, designed to vest in the Commission 'exclusive and plenary' jurisdiction,  20a(7), over changes in the capital structures of the railroads. Its enactment, see Sharfman, op. cit., supra, Vol. I, p. 190, 'was not only a fulfilment of the Commission's repeated recommendations, but grew out of a practical unanimity of opinion among the numerous and diverse interests that sought to influence the character of the new legislation. While this extension of the Commission's authority was designed, indirectly, to protect the investing public against the dissipation of railroad resources through faulty or dishonest financing, its dominant purpose was to maintain a a sound structure for the rehabilitation and support of railroad credit, and for the consequent development of the transportation system. It aimed to render impossible the recurrence of the various financial scandals, with their destruction of confidence in railroad investment, which had become notorious, and to prevent the subordination of the carriers' stake as transportation agencies to the financial advantage of alien interests.' \n\n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNYE v. UNITED STATES(1941)\nNo. 558\nArgued: March 12, 1941Decided: April 14, 1941\n\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lycurgus R. Varser, of Lumberton, N.C., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Herbert Wechsler, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners were adjudged guilty of contempt under  268 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1163, 28 U.S.C.  385, 28 U.S.C.A.  385, for their efforts to obtain a dismissal of a suit brought by one Elmore in the federal District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. Elmore, administrator of the estate of his son, brought that action, in forma pauperis, against one Council and Bernard, partners, trading as B. C. Remedy Co., and alleged that his son died as a result of the use of a medicine, known as B C and manufactured and sold by them. The court appointed William B. Guthrie to represent Elmore. Defendants filed an answer April 29, 1939. On April 19, 1939, Elmore notified the District Judge and his lawyer by letters that he desired to have the case dismissed. The substance of the episode involving the improper conduct of petitioners was found as follows:\n Elmore is illiterate, and feeble in mind and body. Petitioners,1 through the use of liquor and persuasion, induced Elmore to seek a termination of the action. Nye directed his own lawyer to prepare the letters to the District Judge and to Guthrie and to prepare a final administration account to be filed in the local probate court. Nye took Elmore to the probate court, had him discharged as administrator, and paid the clerk a fee of $1. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 40]\n\u00a0\n He then took Elmore to the postoffice, registered the letters and paid the postage. Elmore, however, was not promised or paid anything. These events took place more than 100 miles from Durham, North Carolina, where the District Court was located.\n On September 30, 1939, Guthrie filed a motion2 asking for an order requiring Nye to show cause 'why he shold not be attached and held as for contempt of this Court'.3 The court issued a show cause order to Nye and Mayers who filed their answers. There was a hearing. Evidence was introduced and argument was heard on motions to dismiss. The court found that the writing of the letters and the filing of the final account were pro- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 41]\n\u00a0\n cured by Nye 'for the express and definite purpose of preventing the prosecution of the civil action in the federal court and with intent to obstruct and to prevent the trial of the case on its merits'; and that the conduct of Nye and Mayers 'did obstruct and impede the due administration of justice in this cause; that the conduct has caused a long delay, several hearings and enormous expense.' It accordingly held that their conduct was 'misbehavior so near to the presence of the court as to obstruct the administration of justice' and adjudged each guilty of contempt. It ordered Nye to pay the costs of the contempt proceedings, including $500 to Guthrie, and a fine of $500; and it ordered Mayers to pay a fine of $250. The District Court filed its finding of facts and judgment on February 8, 1940. On March 15, 1940, petitioners filed a notice of appeal from the judgment. \n4\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment. \n5\n 4 Cir., 113 F.2d 1006. We granted the petition for certiorari because the interpretation of the power of the federal courts under  268 of the Judicial Code to punish contempts raised matters of grave importance.\n We are met at the threshold with a question as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals over the appeal. The government concedes that if this was a case of civil contempt, the notice of appeal was effective under Rule 73 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. It argues, however, that the contempt was criminal-in which case the appeal was not timely if the Criminal Appeals Rules \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 42]\n\u00a0\n govern,6 and not made in the proper form if  8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 940, 45 Stat. 54, 28 U.S.C.  230, 28 U.S.C.A.  230, is applicable. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n We do not think this was a case of civil contempt. We recently stated in McCrone v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 61, 64\n, 59 S.Ct. 685, 686, 'While particular acts do not always readily lend themselves to classification as civil or criminal contempts, a contempt is considered civil when the punishment is wholly remedial, serves only the purpose of the complainant, and is not intended as a deterrent to offenses against the public.' The facts of this case do not meet that standard. While the proceedings in the District Court were entitled in Elmore's action and the United States was not a party until the appeal, those circumstances though relevant (Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 445\n, 446 S., 31 S.Ct. 492, 499, 500, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 874) are not conclusive as to the nature of the contempt. The fact that Nye was ordered to pay the costs of the proceeding, including $500 to Guthrie, is also not decisive. As Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, \n259 \nU.S. 107, 110\n, 42 S.Ct. 427, 428, 'Where a fine is imposed, partly as compensation to the complainant and partly as punishment, the criminal feature of the order is dominant and fixes \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 43]\n\u00a0\n its character for purposes of review.' The order imposes unconditional fines payable to the United States. It awards no relief to a private suitor. The prayer for relief8 and the acts charged9 carry the criminal hallmark. Cf. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., supra, 221 U.S. at page 449, 31 S.Ct. at page 501, 34 L.R.A., N.S., 374. They clearly do not reveal any purpose to punish for contempt 'in aid of the adjudication sought in the principal suit'. Lamb v. Cramer, \n285 \nU.S. 217, 220\n, 52 S.Ct. 315, 316. When there is added the 'significant' fact (Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 329\n, 24 S. Ct. 665, 667) that Nye and Mayers were strangers, not parties, to Elmore's action, there can be no reasonable doubt that the punitive character of the order was dominant.\n We come then to the question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals. We disagree with the government in its contention that the appeal in this case was governed by the Criminal Appeals Rules. Those rules were promulgated pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 8, 1934, 48 Stat. 399, 18 U.S.C.  688, 18 U.S.C.A.  688, which provided, inter alia, that this Court should have 'the power to prescribe, from time to time, rules of practice and procedure with respect to any or all proceedings after verdict, or finding of guilt by the court if a jury has been waived, or plea of guilty, in criminal cases.' The rules were adopted 'as the Rules of Practice and Procedure in all proceedings after plea of guilty, verdict of guilt by a jury or finding of guilt by the trial court where a jury is waived, in criminal cases.' \n292 \nU.S. 661\n, 54 S.Ct. xxxvii. In this case there was no plea of guilty, there was \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 44]\n\u00a0\n no verdict of guilt by a jury, and there was no finding of guilt by the court where a jury was waived. To be sure, the rules and the Act are applicable 'in criminal cases'. But we do not agree with the government that the qualifying language of the rules designates merely the stage of the proceedings 'in criminal cases' when the rules become applicable. It is our view that the rules describe the inds of cases to which they are to be applied. The Act of March 8, 1934 amended the Act of February 24, 1933, 47 Stat. 904, which gave this Court rule-making power 'with respect to any or all proceedings after verdict in criminal cases.' The legislative history makes it abundantly clear that the amendment in 1934, so far as material here, was made because 'it would not seem to be desirable that there should be different times and manner of procedure in cases of appeal where there is a verdict of a jury as distinguished from cases in which there is a finding of guilt by the court on the waiver of a jury.' H. Rep. No. 858, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1; S. Rep. No. 257, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1. In light of this history and the language of the order promulgating the rules we conclude that the categories of cases embraced in the rules cannot be expanded by interpretation to include this type of case.\n That conclusion means that this appeal was governed by  8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925. The court is equally divided in opinion as to whether the Circuit Court of Appeals, in absence of an application for allowance of the appeal, had the power to decide the case on the merits. Hence the action of that court in taking jurisdiction over the appeal is affirmed.\n We come then to the merits.\n The question is whether the conduct of petitioners constituted 'misbehavior ... so near' the presence of the court 'as to obstruct the administration of justice' within \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 45]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of  268 of the Judicial Code. \n10\n That section derives from the Act of March 2, 1831, 4 Stat. 487. The Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 83, provided that courts of the United States 'shall have power ... to punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same.' Abuses arose,11 culminating in impeachment proceedings against James H. Peck, a federal district judge, who had imprisoned and disbarred one Lawless for publishing a criticism of one of his opinions in a case which was on appeal. Judge Peck was acquitted. \n12\n But the history of that episode makes abundantly clear that it served as the occasion for a drastic delimination by Congress of the broad undefined power of the inferior federal courts under the Act of 1789\n\n\n The day after Judge Peck's acquittal Congress took steps to change the Act of 1789. The House directed its Committee on the Judiciary 'to inquire into the expediency of defining by statute all offences which may be punished as contempts of the courts of the United States, and also to limit the punishment for the same.' \n13\n Nine \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 46]\n\u00a0\n days later James Buchanan brought in a bill which became the Act of March 2, 1831. He had charge of the prosecution of Judge Peck and during the trial had told the Senate:14 'I will venture to predict, that whatever may be the decision of the Senate upon this impeachment, Judge Peck has been the last man in the United States to exercise this power, and Mr. Lawless has been its last victim.' The Act of March 2, 1831, 'declaratory of the law concerning contempts of court,' contained two sections, the first of which provided:\n'That the power of the several courts of the United States to issue attachments and inflict summary punishments for contempts of court, shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehaviour of any person or persons in the presence of the said courts, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, the misbehaviour of any of the officers of the said courts in their official transactions, and the disobedience or resistance by any officer of the said courts, party, juror, witness, or any other person or persons, to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the said courts.'\n\n Sec. 2 of that Act, from which  135 of the Criminal Code,15 35 Stat. 1113, 18 U.S.C.  241, 18 U.S.C.A.  241, derives, provided:\n'That if any person or persons shall, corruptly, or by threats or force, endeavour to influence, intimidate, or impede any juror, witness, or officer, in any court of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 47]\n\u00a0\n United States, in the discharge of his duty, or shall, corruptly, or by threats or force, obstruct, or impede, or endeavour to obstruct or impede, the due administration of justice therein, very person or persons, so offending, shall be liable to prosecution therefor, by indictment, and shall, on conviction thereof, be punished, by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment, not exceeding three months, or both, according to the nature and aggravation of the offence.'\n\n In 1918 this Court in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402, 418\n, 419 S., 38 S.Ct. 560, 563, 564, stated that 'there can be no doubt' that the first section of the Act of March 2, 1831 'conferred no power not already granted and imposed no limitations not already existing'; and that it was 'intended to prevent the danger by reminiscence of what had gone before of attempts to exercise a power not possessed which ... had been sometimes done in the exercise of legislative power.' The inaccuracy of that historic observation has been plainly demonstrated. Frankfurter & Landis, Power of Congress Over Procedure in Criminal Contempts in 'Inferior' Federal Courts-A Study in Separation of Powers, 37 Harv.L.Rev. 1010. Congress was responding to grievances arising out of the exercise of judicial power as dramatized by the Peck impeachment proceedings. Congress was intent on curtailing that power. The two sections of the Act of March 2, 1831 when read together, as they must be, clearly indicate that the category of criminal cases which could be tried without a jury was narrowly confined. That the previously undefined power of the courts was \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 48]\n\u00a0\n substantially curtailed by that Act was early recognized by lower federal courts. United States v. Holmes, 26 Fed.Cas. 360, at page 363, No. 15,383; Ex parte Poulson, 19 Fed.Cas. 1205, No. 11,350; United States v. New Bedford Bridge, 27 Fed.Cas. 91, at page 104, No. 15,867; United, States v. Seeley, Fed.Cas. No. 16,248a; United States v. Emerson, Fed.Cas. No. 15 050, 4 Cranch, C.C., 188; Kent's Commentaries (3rd ed. 1836) pp. 300, 301. And when the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 511, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledged that it had limited the power of those courts. And see Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 374. So far as the decisions of this Court are concerned, that view persisted to the time when Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, was decided. See Ex parte Wall, \n107 \nU.S. 265\n, 2 S.Ct. 569; Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267, 276\n, 9 S.Ct. 699, 701; Ex parte Cuddy, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 280, 285\n, 9 S. Ct. 703, 704; Eilenbecker v. District Court, \n134 \nU.S. 31, 38\n, 10 S.Ct. 424, 426.\n Mindful of that history, we come to the construction of  268 of the Judicial Code in light of the specific facts of this case. The question is whether the words 'so near thereto' have a geographical or a causal connotation. Read in their context and in the light of their ordinary meaning, we conclude that they are to be construed as geographical terms. In Ex parte Robinson, supra, 19 Wall. at page 511, it was said that as a result of those provisions the power to punish for contempts 'can only be exercised to insure order and decorum' in court. 'Misbehavior of any person in their presence' plainly falls in that category. In re Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289\n, 9 S.Ct. 77. And in Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, supra, it was also held to include attempted bribes of a witness, one in the jury room and within a few feet of the court room and one in the hallway immediately adjoining the court room. See Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517\n, 45 S.Ct. 390. The phrase 'so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice' likewise con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 49]\n\u00a0\n notes that the misbehavior must be in the vicinity of the court. Nelles & King, Contempt by Publication in the United States, 28 Col.L.Rev. 525, 530. It is not sufficient that the misbehavior charged has some direct relation to the work of the court. 'Near' in this context, juxtaposed to 'presence', suggests physical proximity not relevancy. In fact, if the words 'so near thereto' are not read in the geographical sense, they come close, as the government admits, to being surplusage. There may, of course, be many types of 'misbehavior' which will 'obstruct the administration of justice' but which may not be 'in' or 'near' to the 'presence' of the court. Broad categories of such acts, however, were expressly recognized in  2 of the Act of March 2, 1831 and subsequently in  135 of the Criminal Code. It has been held that an act of misbehavior though covered by the latter provisions may also be a contempt if committed in the 'presence' of the Court. Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, supra. And see Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 749\n, 49 S.Ct. 471, 63 A.L.R. 1258. Yet in view of the history of those provisions, meticulous regard for those separate categories of offenses must be had, so that the instances where there is no right to jury trial will be narrowly restricted. If 'so near thereto' be given a causal meaning, then  268 by the process of judicial construction will have regained much of the generality which Congress in 1831 emphatically intended to remove. See Thomas, Problems of Contempt of Court (1934) c. VII. If that phrase be not restricted to acts in the vicinity of the court but be allowed to embrace acts which have a 'reasonable tendency' to 'obstruct the administration of justice' (Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, 247 U.S. at page 421, 38 S.Ct. at page 564) then the conditions which Congress sought to alleviate in 1831 have largely been restored. See Fox, The History of Contempt of Court (1927) c. IX. The result will be that the offenses which Congress designated as true crimes under  2 of the Act of March 2, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 50]\n\u00a0\n 1831 will be absorbed as contempts wherever they may take place. We c nnot by the process of interpretation obliterate the distinctions which Congress drew.\n We are dealing here only with a problem of statutory construction, not with a question as to the constitutionally permissible scope of the contempt power. But that is no reason why we should adhere to the construction adopted by Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, and leave to Congress the task of delimiting the statute as thus interpreted. Though the statute in question has been on the books for over a century, it has not received during its long life the broad interpretation which that decision gave it. Rather, that broad construction is relatively recent. So far as decisions of this Court are concerned, the statute did not receive any such expanded interpretation until Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, was decided in 1918. The decisions of this Court prior to 1918 plainly recognized, as we have noted, that Congress through the Act of March 2, 1831 had imposed a limitation on the power to punish for contempts-a view consistent with the holdings of the lower federal courts during the years immediately following the enactment of the statute. The early view was best expressed in Ex parte Poulson, supra, decided in 1835. In that case it was held that the Act of March 2, 1831 gave the court no power to punish a newspaper publisher for contempt for publishing an 'offensive' article relative to a pending case. It was held that the first section of the Act 'alludes to that kind of misbehavior which is calculated to disturb the order of the court, such as noise, tumultuous or disorderly behavior, either in or so near to it as to prevent its proceeding in the orderly dispatch of its business.' 19 Fed.Cas. at page 1208. That was a plain recognition that the words 'so near thereto' connoted physical proximity. And prior to 1918 the decisions of this Court did not depart from that theory, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 51]\n\u00a0\n however they may have expanded the earlier notions of 'misbehavior'. To be sure, the lower federal courts in the intervening years had expressed a contrariety of views on the meaning of the statute16 and some were giving it an expanded scope17 which was later approved in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra. But it is significant that not until after the turn of this century did the first line of fracture appear suggesting that the statute authorized summary punishment for publication. \n18\n Thus the legislative history of this statute and its career demonstrate that this case presents the question of correcting a plain misreading of language and history so as to give full respect to the meaning which Congress unmistakably intended the statute to have. Its legislative history, its interpretation prior to 1918, the character and nature of the contempt proceedings admonish us not to give renewed vitality to the doctrine of Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, but to recognize the substantial legislative limitations on the contempt power which were occasioned by the Judge Peck episode. And they necessitate an adherence to the original construction of the statute so that, unless its requirements are clearly satisfied, an offense will be dealt with as the law deals with the run of illegal acts. Cf. Mr. Justice Holmes \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 52]\n\u00a0\n dissenting in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, 247 U.S. at pages 422 et seq., 38 S.Ct. at page 565.\n The conduct of petitioners (if the facts found are taken to be true) was highly reprehensible. It is of a kind which corrupts the judicial process and impedes the administration of justice. But the fact that it is not reachable through the summary procedure of contempt does not mean that such conduct can proceed with impunity. Sec. 135 of the Criminal Code, a descendant of  2, of the Act of March 2, 1831, embraces a broad category of offenses. And certainly it cannot be denied that the conduct here in question comes far closer to the family of offenses there described than it does to the more limited classes of contempts described in  268 of the Judicial Code. The acts complained of took place miles from the District Court. The evil influence which affected Elmore was in no possible sense in the 'presence' of the court or 'near thereto'. So far as the crime of contempt is concerned, the fact that the judge received Elmore's letter is inconsequential.\n We may concede that there was an obstruction in the administration of justice, as evidenced by the long delay and large expense which the reprehensible conduct of petitioners entailed. And it would follow that under the 'reasonable tendency' rule of Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, the court below did not err in affirming the judgment of conviction. But for the reasons stated that decision must be overruled. The fact that in purpose and effect there was an obstruction in the administration of justice did not bring the condemned conduct within the vicinity of the court in any normal meaning of the term. It was not misbehavior in the vicinity of the court disrupting to quiet and order or actually interrupting the court in the conduct of its business. Cf. Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, supra, 131 U.S. at page 278, 9 S.Ct. at page 702. Hence, it was not embraced within  268 of the Judicial Code. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 53]\n\u00a0\n If petitioners can be punished for their misconduct, it must be under the Criminal Code where they will be afforded the normal safeguards surrounding criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the judgment below is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n The court below did not pass on the question, mooted here, whether it acquired jurisdiction under the appeal provisions of the applicable section, 8(c) of the Jurisdictional Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C.A.  230. Only four members of this Court are of opinion that it did. Assuming for present purposes that it had jurisdiction to decide the merits, I think its decision was right and that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n We are concerned here only with the meaning and application of an act of Congress which has stood unamended on the statute books for one hundred and ten years. It gives statutory recognition to the power of the federal courts to punish summarily for contempt and provides that that power 'shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person or persons in the presence of the said courts or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.'\n The issue is not whether this statute has curtailed an authority which federal courts exercised before its enactment. Concededly it has. The only question before us is whether it has so limited that authority as to preclude summary punishment of the contemptuous action of petitioner which it is not denied, is 'misbehavior' although not in the presence of the court, and which it is admitted seriously obstructed the administration of justice in a cause pending in the court. The question is important, for if conduct such as this record discloses may not be dealt with summarily the only recourse of a federal court for the protection of the integrity of proceed- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 54]\n\u00a0\n ings pending before it, from acts of corruption and intimidation outside the court room, is to await the indictment of the offenders, with r without adjournment of the pending proceedings as the exigencies of the case may require.\n It is not denied that the distance of the present contemptuous action from the court in miles did not lessen its injurious effect, and in that sense it was 'near' enough to obstruct the administration of justice. The opinion of the Court supports its conclusion on the ground that 'near' means only geographical nearness and so implicitly holds that no contempt is summarily punishable unless it is either in the presence of the court or is some kind of physical interference with or disturbance of its good order, so that the nearness to the court of the contemptuous act has an effect in obstructing justice which it would not have if it took place at a more distant point. From all this it seems to follow that the surreptitious tampering with witnesses, jurors or parties in the presence of the court, although unknown to it, would be summarily punishable because in its presence, but that if it took place outside the court room or while the witness, juror or party was on his way to attend court it would not be punishable because geographical nearness is not an element in making the contemptuous action an obstruction to justice.\n These contentions assume that 'so near thereto' can only refer to geographical position and they ignore the entire history of the judicial interpretation of the statute. 'Near' may connote proximity in causal relationship as well as proximity in space, and under this statute as the opinion seems to recognize even the proximity to the court, in space, of the contemptuous action, is of significance only in its causal relationship to the obstructions to justice which result from disorder or public disturbances. This Court has hitherto, without a dissenting \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 55]\n\u00a0\n voice, regarded the phrase 'so near thereto' as connoting and including those contempts which are the proximate cause of actual obstruction to the administration of justice, whether because of their physical nearness to the court or because of a chain of causation whose operation in producing the obstruction depends on other than geographical relationships to the court. See Ex parte Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S.Ct. 699; Ex parte Cuddy, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 280\n, 9 S.Ct. 703; Toledo Newspaper Company v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402\n, 38 S.Ct. 560, 581; Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 749, 764\n, 765 S., 49 S.Ct. 471, 476, 63 A.L.R. 1258; Craig v. Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255\n, 44 S. Ct. 103. Cf. McCann v. New York Stock Exchange, 2 Cir., 80 F. 2d 211, 213. Contempts which obstruct justice because of their effect on the good order and tranquillity of the court must be in the presence of the court or geographically near enough to have that effect. Contempts which are surreptitious obstructions to justice, through tampering with witnesses, jurors and the like, must be proximately related to the condemned effect. We are pointed to no legislative history which militates against such a construction of the statute.\n In the Savin, the Craig, and the Sinclair cases, as well as in the Toledo case, the contempts were of this latter kind. The contempt held summarily punishable by this Court in the Savin case, decided sixty years ago, was the attempted bribery of a witness at a place in the court house but outside the courtroom, without any disorder or disturbance of the court. The contemptuous acts in the other cases took place at points distant from the court in the city where it sat. In all, the injurious effect on the administration of justice was unrelated to the distance from the court. In holding that they were contempts within the summary jurisdiction of the court this Court definitely decided that 'so near thereto' is not confined to a spatial application where the evil effect of the alleged contempt does not depend upon its physical nearness to the court. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 56]\n\u00a0\n The Savin and Sinclair cases were decided by a unanimous court. The dissent ng judges in the Toledo and Craig cases, in which the acts held to be contemptuous were the publication, at a distance from the court, of comments derogatory to the judge, made no contention that the phrase imposed a geographical limitation on the power of the court. Their position was that the particular contemptuous acts charged did not in fact have the effect of obstructing justice, a contention which cannot be urged here. In the Toledo case Justice Holmes said, 247 U.S. at page 423, 38 S. Ct. at page 565: 'I think that 'so near as to obstruct' means so near as actually to obstruct-and not merely near enough to threaten a possible obstruction'. And in the Craig case, after commenting on the fact that no cause was pending before the court, he said, 263 U.S. at page 281, 44 S.Ct. at page 108: 'Suppose the petitioner falsely and unjustly charged the judge with having excluded him from knowledge of the facts, how can it be pretended that the charge obstructed the administration of justice ...?' Complete agreement with the dissents in these cases neither requires the Court's decision here nor lends it any support.\n I do not understand my brethren to maintain that the secret bribery or intimidation of a witness in the court room may not be summarily punished. Cf. Ex parte Savin, supra; Sinclair v. United States, supra. If so it is only because of the effect of the contemptuous act in obstructing justice which is precisely the same if the bribery or intimidation took place outside the court house. If it may be so punished I can hardly believe that Congress, by use of the phrase 'so near thereto', intended to lay down a different rule if the contemptuous acts took place across the corridor, the street, in another block, or a mile away.\n If the point were more doubtful than it seems to me, I should still think that we should leave undisturbed a construction of the statute so long applied and not hitherto doubted in this Court. We recently declined to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 33, 57]\n\u00a0\n consider the contention that the Sherman Act can never apply to a labor union, because of long standing decisions of this Court to the contrary, a construction which Congress had not seen fit to change. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469, 487\n, 488 S., 60 S.Ct. 982, 988, 989, 128 A.L.R. 1044.\n In view of our earlier decisions and of the serious consequences to the administration of justice if courts are powerless to stop summarily, obstructions like the present, I think the responsibility of departing from the long accepted construction of this statute should be left to the legislative branch of the Government to which it rightfully belongs.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Nye's daughter was married to the son of Council, one of the defendants in the Elmore action. Mayers (Meares) was Nye's tenant who was acquainted with Elmore. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The court had deferred action on Elmore's inspired request for a dismissal at the request of Guthrie and pending an investigation by him. On July 20, 1939, Nye and Elmore's son were examined under oath before the court as to the episode. On August 29, 1939, defendants moved to dismiss Elmore's action on the ground that he had been discharged as administrator. A hearing was held on that motion and Elmore testified respecting his discharge. The evidence so adduced was the basis of the motion for an order to show cause on September 30, 1939. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The motion for an order to show cause also prayed: '2. That the Court call to the attention of the United States District Attorney for this district the entire record in this cause with request to the said United States District Attorney to investigate the question as to whether or not a conspiracy was entered into by and between R. H. Nye, W. E. Timberlake and L. C. Mayers, all of Robeson County, North Carolina, to defeat the administration of justice and the orderly process of this Court have been guilty whether or not they have been guilty of subornation of perjury and further whether they conspired to practice a fraud and did practice of fraud upon this Court. 3. That this matter through the office of the United States District Attorney for this district be sumbitted and inquired into by the Grand Jury for such action and attention the Grand Jury shall deem proper. 4. For such other and furthr procedure as to this Court may seem proper.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] On March 13, 1940, Elmore, with the assent of Guthrie, submitted to a judgment of voluntary non-suit in the action for wrongful death upon payment of a 'substantial sum'. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The United States was made a party when the case was docketed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. It entered its appearance but its attorneys apparently took no further part in the proceedings in that court. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Promulgated May 7, 1934, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 688. Rule III provides that an appeal shall be taken within five days after entry of judgment of conviction or of an order denying a motion for new trial. In the present case, the notice of appeal was filed more than a month after the judgment of the District Court. In case the Criminal Appeals Rules govern, the government also points out that Rule XI requires that petitions for certiorari to review a judgment of the appellate court shall be made within thirty days after the entry of judgment of that court. In the present case the petition for a writ of certiorari was filed about two months after the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appe ls. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 'No ... appeal intended to bring any judgment or decree before a circuit court of appeals for review shall be allowed unless application therefor be duly made within three months after the entry of such judgment or decree.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Supra, note 3. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] On October 30, 1939, the District Court denied motions to dismiss the rule to show cause saying that 'the question to be determined is whether the respondents, or either of them, is guilty of misbehavior in the presence of the Court, or so near thereto to obstruct the administration of justice in this Court, and that is a matter of fact to be determined by the evidence and not on motion.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] This section provides: 'The said courts shall have power to impose and administer all necessary oaths, and to punish, by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court, contempts of their authority: Provided, That such power to punish contempts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, the misbehavior of any of the officers of said courts in their official transactions, and the disobedience or resistance by any such officer, or by any party, juror, witness, or other person to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the said courts.' \n[\nFootnote 11\n] See Nelles & King, Contempt by Publication in the United States, 28 Col.L.Rev. 401, 409 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Stansbury, Report of the Trial of James H.

Johnson, both of Lincoln, Neb., for petitioner.\n Mr. Walter Gordon Merritt, of New York City, for respondents.[ Olsen v. State of Neb. ex rel. Western Reference & Bond Ass'n. \n313 \nU.S. 236\n (1941) ]\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In reliance upon Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S.Ct. 545, 56 A.L.R. 1327, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held, one judge di senting, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n that a statute of that state fixing the maximum compensation which a private employment agency might collect from an applicant for employment1 was unconstitu- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n tional2 under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. State ex rel. Western Reference & Bond Ass'n v. Kinney, 138 Neb. 574, 293 N.W. 393. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted be- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n cause of the importance of the constitutional question which was raised.\n The action is for a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering petitioner, Secretary of Labor of Nebraska, to issue a license to the relator3 to operate a private employment agency for the year commencing May 1, 1940. The license was withheld because of relator's refusal to limit its maximum compensation, as provided by the statute, to ten per cent of the first month's salary or wages of the person for whom employment was obtained. The petition in mandamus challenged the constitutionality of those provisions of the act. \n4\n The answer sought to sustain them by alleging that the business of a private employment agency is 'vitally affected with a public interest' and subject to such regulation under the police power of the state. The relator's motion for judgment on the pleadings was sustained and it was ordered that a peremptory writ of mandamus should issue.\n We disagree with the Supreme Court of Nebraska. The statutory provisions in question do not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n The drift away from Ribnik v. McBride, supra, has been so great that it can no longer be deemed a controlling authority. It was decided in 1928. In the following year this Court held that Tennessee had no power to fix prices at which gasoline might be sold in the state. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 60 A.L.R. 596. Save for that decision and Morehead v. People of State of New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n298 \nU.S. 587\n, 56 S.Ct. 918, 103 A.L.R. 1445, holding unconstitutional a New York statute authorizing the fixing of women's wages, the subsequent cases in this Court have given i creasingly wider scope to the price-fixing powers of the states and of Congress. \n5\n Tagg Bros . & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220, decided in 1930, upheld the power of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act to determine the just and reasonable charges of persons engaged in the business of buying and selling in interstate commerce livestock at a stockyard on a commission basis. In 1931 a New Jersey statute limiting commissions of agents of fire insurance companies was sustained by O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163. A New York statute authorizing the fixing of minimum and maximum retail prices for milk was upheld in 1934. Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469. And see Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n, 55 S.Ct. 7; Borden's Farm Products Co., Inc., v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 251\n, 56 S.Ct. 453. Cf. Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., \n294 \nU.S. 511\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 101 A.L.R. 55; Mayflower Farms, Inc., v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 266\n, 56 S.Ct. 457. In 1937 Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238, was overruled and a statute of Washington which authorized the fixing of minimum wages for women and minors was sustained. West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330. In the same year Townsend v. Yeomans, \n301 \nU.S. 441\n, 57 S. Ct. 842, upheld a \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n Georgia statute fixing maximum warehouse charges for the handling and selling of leaf tobacco. Cf. Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648; Currin v. Wallace, \n306 \nU.S. 1\n, 59 S.Ct. 379. The power of Congress under the commerce clause to authorize the fixing of minimum prices for milk was upheld in United States v. Rock Royal Co- Operative, Inc., \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993, decided in 1939. The next year the price-fixing provisions of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, 15 U.S.C.A.  828-851, were sustained. Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907. And at this term we upheld the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq.; United States v. F. W. Darby Lumber Co., \n312 \nU.S. 100\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. --. These cases represent more than scattered examples of constitutionally permissible price-fixing schemes. They represent in large measure a basic departure from the philosophy and approach of the majority in the Ribnik case. The standard there employed, following that used in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 430 et seq., 47 S.Ct. 426, 428 et seq., 58 A.L. R. 1236, was that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation, at least in absence of a so-called emergency,6 was dependent on whether or not the business in question was 'affected with a public interest'. Cf. Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 \nU.S. 340\n, 36 S.Ct. 561. It was said to be so affected if it had been 'devoted to the public use' and if 'an interest in effect' had been granted 'to the public in that use'. Ribnik v. McBride, supra, 277 U.S. at page 355, 48 S.Ct. at page 545, 56 A.L.R. 1327. That test, labelled by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Tyson case, 273 U.S. at page 446, 47 S.Ct. at pages 433, 434, 58 A.L.R. 1236, as 'little more that a fiction', was discarded in Nebbia v. New York, supra, 291 U.S. at pages 531-539, 54 S.Ct. at pages 513-516, 89 A.L.R. 1469. It was there stated that such criteria 'are not susceptible of definition and form an unsatisfactory test of the constitutionality of legislation directed at business practices or prices', and that the phrase 'affected with a public interest' can mean 'no more than \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n that an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the public ood.' Id., 291 U.S. at page 536, 54 S.Ct. at page 515, 89 A.L.R. 1469. And see the dissenting opinion in Ribnik v. McBride, supra, 277 U.S. at page 359, 48 S.Ct. at page 547, 56 A.L.R. 1327\n\n\n The Ribnik case, freed from the test which it employed, can no longer survive. But respondents maintain that the statute here in question is invalid for other reasons. They insist that special circumstances must be shown to support the validity of such drastic legislation as price-fixing, that the executive, technical and professional workers which respondents serve have not been shown to be in need of special protection from exploitation, that legislative limitation of maximum fees for employment agencies is certain to react unfavorably upon those members of the community for whom it is most difficult to obtain jobs, that the increasing competition of public employment agencies and of charitable, labor union and employer association employment agencies have curbed excessive fees by private agencies, and that there is nothing in this record to overcome the presumption as to the result of the operation of such competitive, economic forces. And in the latter connection respondents urge that since no circumstances are shown which curb competition between the private agencies and the other types of agencies, there are no conditions which the legislature might reasonably believe would redound to the public injury unless corrected by such legislation.\n We are not concerned, however, with the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation. Differences of opinion on that score suggest a choice which 'should be left where ... it was left by the Constitution-to the states and to Congress.' Ribnik v. McBride, supra, 277 U.S. at page 375, 48 S.Ct. at pages 552, 553, 56 A.L.R. 1327, dissenting opinion. There is no necessity for the state to demonstrate before us that evils persist despite the competition which attends the bargaining in this field. In final analysis, the only constitutional pro- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 236, 247]\n\u00a0\n hibitions or restraints which respondents have suggested for the invalidation of this legislation are those notions of public policy embedded in earlier decisions of this Court but which, as Mr. Justice Holmes long admonished, should not be read into the Constitution. Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra, 273 U.S. at page 446, 47 S.Ct. at page 433, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, 261 U.S. at page 570, 43 S.Ct. at page 405, 24 A.L.R. 1238. Since they do not find expression in the Constitution, we cannot give them continuing vitality as standards by which the constitutionality of the economic and social programs of the states is to be determined.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Nebraska for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Neb.Comp.Stat.1929,  48-508:\n'Private Employment Agencies, Registration Fee. A registration fee not to exceed two dollars may be charged by such licensed agency when such agency shall be at actual expense in advertising such individual applicant, or in looking up the reference of such applicant. In all such cases a complete record of such references shall be kept on file which record shall, during all business hours, be open for the inspection of the secretary of labor, the chief deputy secretary of labor, or any other inspector appointed by the secretary of labor to make such inspection, and upon demand shall be subject to the inspection and examination by the applicant. For such registration fee a receipt shall be given to said applicant for help or employment, giving name of such applicant, date of payment and character of position or help applied for. Such registration fee shall be returned to said applicants on demand, after thirty days and within sixty days from date of receipt, less the amount that has been actually expended by said licensed agency for said applicant, and an itemized account of such expenditures shall be presented to said applicant on request at the time of returning the unused portion of such registration fee, provided no position has been furnished by said licensed agency to and accepted by said applicant. No licensed person or persons shall, as a condition to registering or obtaining employment for such applicant, require such applicant to subscribe to any publication or exact other fees, compensation or reward, other than the registration fee, aforesaid, and a further fee, the amount of which shall be agreed upon between such applicant and such licensed person, to be payable at such time as may be agreed upon in writing, 'the amount of which, together with said registration fee of $2.00 added thereto shall in no case exceed 10 per cent of all moneys paid to or to be paid or earned by said applicant, for the first month's service growing out of said employment furnished by said employer. Provided, however, that if through no fault of said applicant or employee, he fails to remain in service with said employer and other positions or places of employment are furnished to said applicant by said licensed agency, then said licensed agency shall not accept, collect or charge more than one fee every three months,' but the further fee aforesaid shall not be received by such licensed person before the applicant has been tendered a position by said licensed person. In the event that the position, so tendered is not accepted by or given such applicant, said licensed person shall refund all fees requested by said applicant, other than the registration fees aforesaid within three days after demand is made therefor. \n\n No such licensed person shall send out any applicant for employment without having obtained a bona fide order therefor, and if it shall appear that no employment of the kind applied for existed at the place where said applicant was directed, said licensed person shall refund to such applicant within five days after demand, any sum paid by such applicant for transportation in going to and returning from said place and all fees paid by said applicant. In addition to the receipt provided to be given for registration fee it shall be the duty of such licensed person to give, to every applicant for employment from whom other fee or fees shall be received, an additional receipt, in which shall be stated the name of such applicant, the date and amoun of such other fees; and to every applicant for help from whom other fee or fees shall be received, and (an) additional receipt, stating the name and address of said applicant, the date and amount of such other fee or fees, and the kind of help to be provided. All receipts shall have printed on the back thereof, in the English language, the name and address of the state secretary of labor and the chief deputy secretary of labor. Every such licensed person shall give to every applicant for employment, a card or printed paper containing the name of the applicant, the name and address of such employment agency, and the written name and address of the person to whom the applicant is sent for employment. If an employee furnished fails to remain one week in a situation, through no fault of the employer, then all fees paid or pledged, in excess of the registration fee aforesaid, shall be refunded to the employer upon demand. If the employment furnished the applicant does not continue more than one week, through no fault of the employee, then all fees paid or pledged, in excess of the registration fee aforesaid, shall be refunded to the employee upon demand.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The court upheld those provisions of the statute under  3, Art. I of the Nebraska Constitution which provides that 'No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' See Art. XV,  9. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The petition in mandamus was filed by respondent Western Reference & Bond Assn., Inc. The other respondents are Mills Teachers Agency, Thomas Employment Service, Co-Operative Reference Co., Marti Reference Co., Watts Reference Co., Cornhusker Teachers Bureau, Grace Boomer, and Davis School Service, who intervened in the action and challenged the constitutionality of the act. Their petition of intervention stated that they, as well as the relator, confine their business 'to soliciting and securing positions for clerical, executive, technical and professional workers, and do not engage in the business of securing placements for common laborers, domestic servants or other classes of unskilled workers.' That seems to be conceded. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] By stipulation filed in the state court it was agreed that the 'sole and only issue for determination' was the constitutionality of the act 'in so far as the same fixes or limits the fees or compensation of private employment agencies.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] But see New State Ice Co. v.

Administrator of W. and H.D. \n312 \nU.S. 126\n (1941) ]\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ben F. Cameron, of Meridian, Miss., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n Francis Biddle, Sol. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 133]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Three types of questions are presented by the petition for certiorari in this case:\n First, whether the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., is authorized by the Commerce Clause, art. 1,  8, cl. 3, violates the Tenth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and is an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of Congress to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, appointed pursuant to  4(a) of the Act.\n Second, whether an order of the Administrator prescribing a minimum wage in an industry is unauthorized by the statute and invalid because the procedure of the Administrator and an Industry Committee appointed by him pursuant to  5 of the Act, which resulted in the order, is unauthorized and violates the Fifth Amendment.\n Third, whether the order of the Administrator is invalid because his findings on which the order is based are without the support of substantial evidence. The challenged findings are that the minimum wage established by the order will not substantially curtail employment, and that a classification within the industry is unnecessary for the purpose of fixing, for each classification within it, the highest minimum wage which will not substantially curtail employment in such classification and will not give any competitive advantage to any group in the industry. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 134]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner, Opp Cotton Mills, Inc., an Alabama corporation subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, alleging that it was aggrieved by an order of respondent, the Administrator, brought the present proceeding in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit pursuant to  10 of the Act, to review and set aside the order fixing a uniform 32 1\/2 cents per hour minimum wage for the textile industry and for other relief. So far as now relevant petitioners challenged the validity of the Act and the order upon the grounds already memtioned. The Court of Appeals sustained the order. 5 Cir., 111 F.2d 23. We granted certiorari, October 14, 1940, on a petition raising the same questions concerning the validity of the order which we deem of public importance in the administration of the Act. \n311 \nU.S. 631\n, 61 S.Ct. 46, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The general scope of the Act and the provisions of  15(a)(1)(2) and ( 5) and  6 and 7, prohibiting the manufacture for and shipment in interstate commerce of goods produced for the commerce by employees employed at less than the prescribed minimum wage or more than the prescribed maximum hours without payment of the required overtime wage, have been discussed in United States v. Darby Lumber Company, \n312 \nU.S. 100\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day. It is unnecessary to repeat that discussion here.\n We are here concerned with  5(a),  6(a)(4), and  8, under which the proceedings were had which resulted in the challenged order of the Administrator. These sections read together set up an administrative procedure for establishing a minimum wage in particular industries greater than the statutory minimum prescribed by  6, but not in excess of 40 cents an hour, such increase over the statutory minimum to be fixed for any industry subject to the Act by the Administrator in collaboration with an industry committee.\n Section 5 provides, subsection (a), that the Administrator shall appoint an industry committee for each in- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 135]\n\u00a0\n dustry engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for the commerce; that, subsection (b), the committee shall include persons representing the public, one of whom shall be designated as chairman, a like number representing employees in the industry, a like number representing employers in the industry, and directs that 'In the appointment of the persons representing each group, the Administrator shall give due regard to the geographical regions in which the industry is carried on'; that, subsection (d), the Administrator shall submit to the committee from time to time available data on matters referred to it, shall cause to be brought before the committee in connection with such matters any witnesses whom he deems material, and that the committee may summon other witnesses or call upon the Administrator to furnish additional information to aid it in its deliberations.\n Section 6(a)(4) provides that at any time after the effective date of the section the minimum wage shall be 'not less than the rate (not in excess of 40 cents an hour) prescribed in the applicable order of the Administrator issued under section 8 (208)'. Section 8(a) prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Administrator and industry committee in establishing the minimum wage authorized by  6(a)(4). It provides that with the view to carrying out the policy of the Act 'by reaching, as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment, the objective of a universal minimum wage of 40 cents an hour in each industry' subject to the Act, the Administrator 'shall from time to time convene the industry committee for each such industry' which 'shall ... recommend the minimum rate or rates of wages to be paid under section 6 (206) by employers' subject to the Act 'in such industry or classifications therein'.\n Upon the Administrator's referring to the committee the question of minimum wage rates in an industry,  8 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 136]\n\u00a0\n (b) requires it to 'investigate conditions in the industry', authorizes it or a sub-committee to 'hear such witnesses and receive such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the committee to perform its duties and functions' under the Act and requires the committee to 'recommend to the Administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry which it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry'. Subsection (c) requires the committee for any industry to 'recommend such reasonable classifications within any industry as it determines to be necessary for the purpose of fixing for each classification within such industry the highest minimum wage rate (not in excess of 40 cents an hour) which (1) will not substantially curtail employment in such classification and (2) will not give a competitive advantage to any group in the industry, and shall recommend for each classification in the industry the highest minimum wage rate which the committee determines will not substantially curtail employment in such classification'. It further directs that 'no classification shall be made, and no minimum wage rate shall be fixed, solely on a regional basis, but the industry committee and the Administrator shall consider among other relevant factors the following:\n'(1) competitive conditions as affected by transportation, living, and production costs;\n\n'(2) the wages established for work of like or comparable character by collective labor agreements negotiated between employers and employees by representatives of their own choosing; and\n\n'(3) the wages paid for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum-wage standards in the industry.'\n\n By  8(d) after the industry committee files its report with the Administrator he, 'after due notice to inter- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 137]\n\u00a0\n ested persons, and giving them an opportunity to be heard, shall by order approve and carry into effect the recommendations contained in such report, if he finds that the recommendations are made in accordance with law, are supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing, and, taking into consideration the same factors as are required to be considered by the industry committee, will carry out the purposes of this section'. Otherwise the Administrator is required to disapprove the recommendations of the committee and again refer the matter to the committee or to another committee for the industry which he may appoint for that purpose. Subsection (f) provides among other things that the wage orders of the Administrator 'shall define the industries and classifications therein to which they are to apply' and subsection (g) provides that 'due notice of any hearing provided for in the section shall be given by publication in the Federal Register and by such other means as the administrator deems reasonably calculated to give general notice to interested persons.'\n As appears from his findings in support of the order, the Administrator, on September 13, 1938, appointed Industry Committee No. 1 for the textile industry, that industry being so defined by the order of appointment as to include the manufacture of cotton, silk, rayon and other products. Seven persons representing the public, seven representing employers in the industry, and seven representing employees were appointed to the Committee. Upon request of the Administrator at the Committee's first meeting in October, 1938, subcommittees were appointed for the purpose of considering precisely where the line should be drawn between the textile and some related industries not included in the definition adopted. Before the Committee concluded its deliberations on the recommended wage order the Administrator modified the definition in certain respects not now material. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 138]\n\u00a0\n At a meeting in December, 1938, the Committee heard witnesses and received briefs and memoranda from numerous interested parties. Statistical and economic studies by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Economic Section of the Wage and Hour Division had been previously submitted. The Committee then designated another subcommittee to gather additional information and hear such testimony as it deemed necessary to enable the Committee to arrive at a wage recommendation. This subcommittee obtained further economic data and heard additional witnesses including representatives of the American Association of Cotton Manufacturers of which petitioner is a member.\n On March 21, 1939, after extended discussion and deliberation, the Committee, by a vote of thirteen to six, adopted a resolution which fixed tentatively a minimum wage of 32 1\/2 cents an hour amounting to $13 per forty-hour week or $676 for 52 weeks, as the rate to be recommended to the Administrator. At this meeting the Committee rejected proposals to establish classifications in the industry and wage differentials among the classes. A subcommittee was appointed to draft a report, and on May 22nd and 23rd, after the Administrator had again modified the definition of the industry, the Committee again approved by the same vote as before the 32 1\/2 cents minimum wage. The report was accepted and signed, the minority filing two reports in opposition to the recommendation. The report detailed the proceedings of the Committee, analyzed the evidence and data upon which the Committee relied in making its recommendation, gave special consideration to the question whether the wage fixed would curtail employment in the industry generally and in the southern cotton mills in particular, and to the problem of classification. It concluded that 'no reasonably efficient enterprise in the textile industry need fear the result of the modest wage standard recommended for \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 139]\n\u00a0\n the industry', and that the data before it 'did not warrant any regional' or other 'classification'.\n On May 27th the Administrator gave notice in the Federal Register which was also issued to the press and published in many newspapers, of a public hearing on the recommendations of the Committee. At the hearing which commenced on June 19, 1939, and was concluded on July 11th, more than 135 witnesses were heard, over 3,300 pages of testimony were taken and eight volumes of exhibits were submitted; oral arguments were heard by the Administrator on July 25th and written briefs were received until August 22, 1939. On September 29, 1939, the Administrator made his findings and order carrying into effect the recommendations of the Committee, effective October 24, 1939, the date on which pursuant to  6(a)( 2) a minimum wage of 30 cents per hour for all employees subject to the Act became effective.\n The industry, as defined by the order, includes broadly the manufacture of yarns and fabrics of cotton and competing material such as rayon and silk, and of those finished products such as sheets, towels and napkins which are normally manufactured in the fabric weaving mills. The Administrator found that the basic considerations in determining which manufacturing processes were to be included within the definition were competitive interrelationships, convertibility of looms and the operations normally carried on by textile mills.\n Although the Administrator was of opinion that the question of the composition of the Industry Committee was not properly before him for determination, he reviewed the evidence and concluded that the members had been chosen with due regard to the geographical regions in which the industry is carried on and that the Committee had considered the factors set forth in  8 of the Act and had reached its recommendation in accordance with law. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 140]\n\u00a0\n The Administrator found that the 32 1\/2 cent minimum wage would increase the average wage bill for the textile industry as a whole 4 per cent over the 25 cent minimum in effect before October 24, 1939, and 2.1 per cent over the 30 cent minimum in effect thereafter and that the wage increases in the southern portion of the industry would be 6.25 per cent and 2.15 per cent over the 25 and 30 cent minimum respectively. He further found that since the average labor costs do not constitute over 36 per cent of production costs the minimum wage increase would increase production costs slightly over one-third of the percentages of wage increases just indicated, and that the increase in production costs would not result in such a rise in prices to ultimate consumers of the finished product as to decrease consumer demand.\n From all this he drew the conclusion that there would be no substantial curtailment of employment in the industry as a whole or in its southern branch as a result of the increased wage. In the case of small cotton mills in the south employing only 7 per cent of the southern cotton textile workers (5 per cent of all in the entire cotton industry), paying the lowest wages, he concluded that the new minimum rate as contrasted with the 30 cent statutory rate would raise manufacturing costs more than the 1.94 per cent average, and for these mills the increase would range from 2.77 per cent to 3.75 per cent. The Administrator found that curtailment of employment even in the mills paying the lowest wages would be dependent on total cost and the technological and general efficiency of each mill, and that low wages do not necessarily coincide with a low degree of efficiency. The Administrator found generally that the small southern mills are not necessarily marginal or the least profitable and that, accepting the figures submitted by the group of small mills opposing the 32 1\/2 cent minimum, the increase in labor costs for such mills would be 13.5% and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 141]\n\u00a0\n only 4 per cent in total manufacturing cost over the 25 cent minimum. The increase over the 30 cent minimum would be slightly over one-third of these percentages. The Administrator also found that a modernization program in these mills would displace only a small number of employees. From these and other facts detailed in the findings, the Administrator concluded that there would be no substantial curtailment of employment even in the group of small mills.\n The Administrator also considered the factors for determining whether classification should be made for wage differentials within the industry. After examining numerous studies of living costs made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor he concluded that the costs of living in the north exceeds that in the south by about 4.6% on the average, and that the differences in costs between cities in each region greatly exceed the difference between the two regions as a whole. He accordingly concluded that living costs do not vary substantially or uniformly between regions and do not effect competitive conditions in the industry. He found that northern mills had an advantage with respect to transportations costs in shipping to the New England states, but southern mills had an advantage in shipping to the middle west and south, having a great population; that many northern finishing mills receive unfinished cloth from southern factories and thus bear the disadvantage in freight rates from the south to northern finishing mills and that on an average the south has a slight transportation advantage with respect to cotton coming to the mills there. He concluded that even with the average freight rates in the south somewhat higher than the north, on the whole the advantages and disadvantages in transportation costs in the two regions were approximately in balance and that any remaining disadvantage was so small as not to affect competitive conditions appreciably. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 142]\n\u00a0\n After considering the proportion of obsolescent machinery in northern and southern mills, their taxes, efficiency of workers, power and construction costs and profits, the Administrator found that the southern mills were at least in a positions of equality with northern mills in so far as these factors affect production costs, and that after the establishment of the 32 1\/2 cent minimum the prevailing minimum wages in the north would be considerably higher than in the south. He concluded that neither wage rates in collective labor agreements nor wages paid by employers maintaining voluntary minimum wage standards required a classification within the industry, and finally he concluded that the Industry Committee's recommendations 'are made in accordance with law, are supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing, and taking into consideration the same factors as are required to be considered by the Industry Committee, the prescribed 32 1\/2 cent wage will carry out the purposes of  8 of the Act'.\n Constitutionality of the Act. The objections that the sections of the Act imposing a minimum wage and maximum hours are not within the commerce power and infringes the Tenth and Fifth Amendments were discussed and disposed of in our opinion in United States v. Darby Lumber Co., supra. Since petitioner concedes that he is engaged in the manufacture of cotton goods for interstate commerce it is unnecessary to consider these contentions further here.\n There remains the question whether the Act is an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of Congress. Petitioner urges that the standards prescribed for fixing the authorized minimum wages between 30 and 40 cents per hour are too vague and indefinite to admit of any judicial determination whether they are within or without the standards prescribed by Congress. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 143]\n\u00a0\n It is not seriously urged that the policy and standards of the statute are subject to these criticisms independently of the provisions relating to classification. Section 8 defines, with precision, the policy of the Act to raise the minimum wage to the 40 cents per hour limit 'as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment' in each industry, and the standards of the administrative action applicable to the Administrator are those made applicable to the committee which it is provided 'shall recommend to the Administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry which it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry'. But it is said that application of these standards in an industry is made contingent upon the determination whether the industry is to be classified and if so, whether it is to be subject to particular wage differentials, and that these determinations in turn depend upon factors so inadequately defined as to afford no standard of administrative action.\n Committee and Administrator are required, as prerequisites for the classification, to determine that it will not give a competitive advantage to any group in the industry, and that the prescribed wage will not substantially curtail employment in each classification, and in making these determinations the committee and Administrator must consider 'among other relevant factors', competitive conditions as affected by transportation, living and production costs, and the wage scale for comparable work established by collective bargaining labor agreements, and by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum wage standards in the industry.\n It is urged that the statute does not prescribe the relative weight to be given to the specified factors or the other unnamed 'relevant factors'. It is said that this, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 144]\n\u00a0\n with the further requirements that the prescribed wage is to be fixed with 'due regard to economic and competitive conditions'; that the classification if made shall not 'give a competitive advantage to any group in the industry', and that the prescribed wage must be one fixed 'without substantially curtailing employment', leave the function which the committee and Administrator are to perform so vague and indefinite as to be practically without any Congressional guide or control.\n The mandate of the Constitution, Art. 1,  1, that all legislative powers granted 'shall be vested' in Congress has never been thought to preclude Congress from resorting to the aid of administrative officers or boards as fact-finding agencies whose findings, made in conformity to previously adopted legislative standards or definitions of congressional policy, have been made prerequisite to the operation of its statutory command. The adoption of the declared policy by Congress and its definition of the circumstances in which its command is to be effective, constitute the performance, in the constitutional sense, of the legislation function.\n True, the appraisal of facts in the light of the declared policy and in conformity to prescribed legislative standards, and the inferences to be drawn by the administrative agency from the facts, so appraised, involve the exercise of judgment within the prescribed limits. But where, as in the present case, the standards set up for the guidance of the administrative agency, the procedure which it is directed to follow and the record of its action which is required by the statute to be kept or which is in fact preserved, are such that Congress, the courts and the public can ascertain whether the agency has conformed to the standards which Congress has prescribed, there is no failure of performance of the legislative function. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 145]\n\u00a0\n While fact finding may be and often is a step in the legislative process, the Constitution does not require that Congress should find for itself every fact upon which it bases legislation. 'It is a constitution we are expounding ... intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs'. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407, 415. In an increasingly complex society Congress obviously could not perform its functions if it were obliged to find all the facts subsidiary to the basic conclusions which support the defined legislative policy in fixing, for example, a tariff rate, a railroad rate or the rate of wages to be applied in particular industries by a minimum wage law. The Constitution, viewed as a continuously operative charter of government, is not to be interpreted as demanding the impossible or the impracticable. The essentials of the legislative function are the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a rule of conduct. Those essentials are preserved when Congress specifies the basic conclusions of fact upon ascertainment of which, from relevant data by a designated administrative agency, it ordains that its statutory command is to be effective.\n The present statute satisfies those requirements. The basic facts to be ascertained administratively are whether the prescribed wage as applied to an industry will substantially curtail employment, and whether to attain the legislative end there is need for wage differentials applicable to classes in industry. The factors to be considered in arriving at these determinations, both those specified and 'other relevant factors', are those which are relevant to or have a hearing on the statutory objective. The fact that Congress accepts the administrative judgment as to the relative weights to be given to these factors in each case when that judgment in other respects \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 146]\n\u00a0\n is arrived at in the manner prescribed by the statute, instead of attempting the impossible by prescribing their relative weight in advance for all cases, is no more an abandonment of the legislative function than when Congress accepts and acts legislatively upon the advice of experts as to social or economic conditions without re-examining for itself the data upon which that advice is based.\n Measured by this requirement the present statute is no less an exercise of the legislative function than was the Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 858, authorizing the President to raise or lower tariff duties so as to equalize the difference which, with the aid of the Tariff Commission, he finds between the costs of production of dutiable articles in this and in foreign countries, his determination, to be based upon a variety of relevant factors, some specified and others not, for which the statute prescribed no relative weight.

Rock Royal Co- Operative, \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993 (Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq.).\n The procedure before the Industry Committee. The procedure before the Committee is assailed upon three principal grounds: that the changes in definition of the textile industry made after the appointment of the Committee rendered the order of appointment void; that the order defining the industry is also invalid because the Administrator placed the woolen industry in a different \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 147]\n\u00a0\n industry under a different Committee, rather than in the textile industry including cotton, silk and rayon; and that the Committee was not properly constituted under the statute because the Administrator in selecting it did not give 'due regard to the geographical regions in which the industry is carried on'. Certain procedures before the Committee are also challenged because they are said to be unauthorized or contrary to the statute or to the requirements of due process.\n At the outset the distinct separation of the functions to be performed by the committee under  8(a), (b), (c), (d), from that to be performed by the Administrator after submission of the committee's report, is to be noted. The committee is required to be composed of equal numbers of representatives of the public, of the employers and of the employees in the industry, selected with due regard to geographical considerations. It acts as an investigating body with the duty to report its recommendations to the Administrator. Its report is the basis of the proceedings before the Administrator under  8(d) which are judicial in character, with provisions for notice and full hearing. The issue to be determined by the Administrator upon the hearing is whether the recommendations of the committee 'are made in accordance with law, are supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing, and, taking into consideration the same factors as are required to be considered by the industry committee, will carry out the purposes of this section'. Review of the Administrator's order fixing a wage is had under  10 by petition to the circuit court of appeals on the record made before the Administrator. Thus under the provisions of  8( d) no wage is fixed which is not recommended by the committee, and not then without appropriate hearing, findings and order by the Administrator.\n As already stated the Administrator's order of September 13, 1938, setting up the Industry Committee, de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 148]\n\u00a0\n fined the industry so as to include the manufacture of a variety of cotton, silk and rayon products, including those made by petitioner, and throughout the proceedings his product was so included. On recommendation of the committee two changes in the definition were made with reference to the inclusion and exclusion of products which were near the borderline of the definition before the amendment. December 19, 1938, the order was amended so as to exclude knitted fabrics and to include other products such as blankets and sheets. A second amendment ordered by the Administrator on May 22, 1939, just before the committee adopted its report, added to the Industry the manufacture of mixed products containing not more than 45 per cent wool.\n In all this we can find no failure to comply with the statute. Section 5(a) directs that 'the Administrator shall as soon as practicable appoint an industry committee for each industry' subject to the Act. But it does not direct a final definition of the industry to be made before the committee meets and such a requirement plainly would not comport with the purposes of the Act. Section 8(f) provides that orders of the Administrator 'issued under this section' which are the final orders fixing a wage 'shall define the industries and classifications therein to which they are to apply'. So far as the definition is open to attack, it is upon the record made before the Administrator if it there appears that the definition does not conform to the statute, or that the recommendations of the committee were based on a different definition of the industry from that finally made and so do not support an order for the industry as defined. \n1\n But subject to these requirements which in- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 149]\n\u00a0\n sure that recommendations of the committee and the order of the Administrator are based on the same definition of the industry, there is no provision of the statute preventing amendment of the definition while the matter is pending before the committee and no purpose or policy of the Act which would be served by precluding such amendments so long as the report of the committee is based on the amended definition. It is to the advantage of the administration of the Act that the completeness and accuracy of the definition should be reexamined and the definition revised with the aid of the committee at any time before its report is submitted. We find nothing in the statute to prevent it.\n Section 3[h] defines 'Industry' as meaning 'industry, or branch thereof, or group of industries'. In defining the textile industry and in fixing for it a wage which with due regard to 'economic and competitive conditions' will not substantially curtail employment in the industry it was appropriate for the Administrator to take into account competitive conditions. In defining the industry the Administrator took into account the competitive interrelationship of the fabrics included and the interchangeability of the looms employed in producing them; and in excluding the woolen industry he took account of its competitive relationships with the products included and the different nature of the establishments, labor forces and wage structures associated with the two types of product. On the record before us, we cannot say that in so doing he transgressed any provision of the statute. Nor can we say that in applying these tests he departed from its purpose. The inclusion of a given product in one industry or another, where both are subject to the Act, principally concerns convenience in administering the Act. For the provisions for classification with appropriate wage differentials affords ample apportunity for fixing an appropriate \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 150]\n\u00a0\n wage with respect to any product whether it is placed in one industry or another. There is no serious contention and we find no basis for saying that the evidence does not support the Administrator's order with respect to exclusion of wool from the definition of the textile industry.\n We conclude also that the composition of the Committee satisfies the requirements of the Act. The Committee consisted of twenty-one persons, seven selected from each of the three groups represented. Of the employer representatives five were cotton goods manufacturers, and four of these were from the southern states. The rayon and silk manufacturers each had one representative. Since these branches of the industry are predominantly northern they were selected from the north. Three of the seven members representing the public were from southern states, one was from Pennsylvania and three from the middle west. Two of the representatives of labor were from the south, three from the north and two of them from Washington, D.C. All five of the non-southern labor members of the Committee were executive officials of or connected with labor orgaizations, national in scope, which represented employees in the south. Thus nine of the members of the Committee were from the south, and the Administrator could have concluded that five others fairly represented the south.\n While only 31 per cent of the factories in the industry are in the south, 51.5 per cent of the value of the product is produced in southern mills and 55 per cent of the wage earners in the industry are employed by those mills. Petitioner argues that since the south had a mathematical preponderance in the Industry the Administrator was required by the statute to appoint a majority of each group, or at least a majority of the members of the committee from that region. But the requirement of the statute that the Administrator give 'due \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 151]\n\u00a0\n regard' to geographical considerations is not a requirement for a mathematical geographical apportionment of the committee. It calls for the exercise of discretion by the Administrator in selecting, with the purposes of the Act in mind, a committee on which the geographically distributed interests of the Industry shall be fairly represented. As the record shows that the lowest wage scale prevailed in the southern mills, the Administrator could have concluded that a selection of a committee, a majority of whose members represented a low wage locality would tend to defeat the purposes of the Act. The Act was also intended to protect the interests of employers and employees of mills in other localities which compete with the low wage scale mills. We cannot say that the Administrator failed to give 'due regard' to geographical considerations or otherwise abused his discretion in the selection of the committee.\n Petitioner makes a great variety of criticisms of the proceedings before the committee, all of which rest on the presupposition that either the statute or the demand of due process of law requires the Committee to hold hearings upon notice to interested persons and that its hearings be subject to review before the Administrator and finally as a part of the proceedings before the Administrator to judicial review on petition to the Circuit Court of Appeals, as provided by  10.\n Section 5(c) directs that the Administrator shall 'by rules and regulations prescribe the procedure to be followed by the committee'. Section 5(d), as already noted, provides that the Administrator shall submit data to the committee, shall cause witnesses whom he deems material to be brought before it, and that the committee 'may summon other witnesses' to aid in its deliberations. Section 8(b) requires the industry committee to 'investigate' conditions in the industry. It provides that the committee 'may hear such witnesses and re- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 152]\n\u00a0\n ceive such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate' and requires the commiteee to 'recommend' to the Administrator 'the highest minimum wage rates ... which it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry'. After the report is filed with the Administrator he, upon due notice and hearing, is required to approve or reject the recommendations.\n It is clear that the sections of the statute now before us do not require the committee to conduct a quasi-judicial proceeding upon notice and hearing. Its function, as already stated, is to investigate upon the basis of data which the Administrator may submit and which the committee may procure for itself and to report its recommendation with respect to the minimum wage. Cf. Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, supra, \n288 \nU.S. 318\n, 53 S.Ct. 359. That such is the interpretation of the statute is abundantly supported by its legislative history. See Conference Committee Report, H. Rept. No. 2738, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 31, and the explanation of the bill by the Chairman of the Senate Committee, 83 Cong.Rec. 9164. In his statement he pointed out that the procedure is modeled upon the New York Minimum Wage Act, see Morehead v. People of State of New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n298 \nU.S. 587, 619\n, 56 S.Ct. 918, 926, 103 A.L.R. 1445, and he emphasized that no minimum wage rate could be established which had not been first 'carefully worked out' by a committee drawn principally from the industry itself and that it should not then be put into effect 'by administrative action which has not been found to be in accordance with law by an independent responsible administrative officer of the government, exercising an independent judgment on the evidence after a legal hearing'.\n The demands of due process do not require a hearing, at the initial stage or at any particular point or at more than one point in an administrative proceeding so long \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 153]\n\u00a0\n as the requisite hearing is held befoer the final order becomes effective. The proceedings before the Administrator as provided by  8(b) satisfy the requirements of due process without further requirement, which the statute omits, of a hearing on notice before the committee. York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15\n, 11 S.Ct. 9; American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 102, 86 A.L.R. 298; United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 457, 463\n, 54 S.Ct. 471, 473.\n The command of  8[d] that the Administrator, as a prerequisite to a wage order, find that the recommendations of the committee 'are made in accordance with law' does not extend to a review of the evidence and hearings before the committee or an investigation of the mental processes by which committee members reached their conclusion to recommend the minimum wage, or extend beyond inquiry upon evidence before the Administrator whether the requirement of statute and rules of the Administrator as to the composition of the committee, the definition of the industry, and the actions required to be taken by the committee have been observed.\n Such being the function of the committee it is immaterial that substitutes were appointed for two members in the course of its deliberations, it not appearing that they did not consider the evidence taken and the proceedings had before their appointment to the committee.\n Procedure before the Administrator. Notice of the hearing before the Administrator was given in conformity to the statute, and since the notice was forty days in advance of the time when petitioner's representative was heard and introduced evidence into the record and a further opportunity was given to present evidence, the contention that the notice to petitioner was inadequate or failed to meet constitutional requirements is without merit. And as the issue for determination by the Administrator in the light of the statutory require- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 154]\n\u00a0\n ments was framed by the report and recommendation of the committee to the Administrator there was no failure to inform petitioner of the contentions made in behalf of the Government. Cf. Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468\n, 56 S.Ct. 906; Id., \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 999. Nor can we find any error or want of due process in permitting the Industry Committee to appear before the Administrator by counsel and to offer evidence in support of its recommendations or in permitting members of the staff of the Wage and Hour Division to give testimony. See Denver Union Stock Yard Co. v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 470, 477\n, 58 S.Ct. 990, 995\n\n\n Support in the evidence of the Administrator's findings. By  10 review of the Administrator's order by the courts is limited to questions of law 'and findings of fact by the Administrator when supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive.' Petitioner attacks the Administrator's findings that the 32 1\/2 cent minimum will not substantially curtail employment and that classification of the industry is not required, on the ground that they are not supported by substantial evidence.\n Since the statute required these findings to be based upon consideration of economic and competitive conditions in the industry, as affected by transportation, living and production costs, including wages, the findings rest, to a substantial degree upon studies of statistical data with respect to these factors gathered by government agencies and published by them officially. They include publications of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Economic Section of the Wages and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. The most important and the principal object of attack is Bulletin No. 663 of the Bureau of Labor Statistics entitled 'Wages in Cotton Goods Manufacturing', which is a study of the economic conditions generally prevailing in the cotton textile industry and in particular of the wages of employees. The statistics gathered, if regarded as of proba- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 155]\n\u00a0\n tive force, and the inferences drawn from them by the Administrator, taken with other evidence, amply support his findings.\n The argument of petitioner is not that the record contains no evidence supporting the findings but rather that this class of evidence must be ignored because not competent in a court of law. But it has long been settled that the technical rules for the exclusion of evidence applicable in jury trials do not apply to proceedings before federal administrative agencies in the absence of a statutory requirement that such rules are to be observed. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 44\n, 24 S.Ct. 563, 568; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S.Ct. 185, 187; Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117\n, 40 S.Ct. 466; United States v. Abilene & Southern R. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, 569; John Bene & Sons v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 299 F. 468, 471. We need not consider whether this class of evidence must be excluded from proceedings in court.\n Further the documents in question were received in evidence without objection. And even in a court of law if evidence of this character is admitted without objection it is to be considered and must be accorded 'its natural probative effect as if it were in law admissible'. Diaz v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 32 S.Ct. 250, 251, 252, Ann.Cas.1913C, 1138; Rowland v. St. Louis & San Francisco R.R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 37 S.Ct. 577, 578; cf. United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 312\n, 47 S.Ct. 413, 415.\n The reliability of the data published in the Bulletin was supported before the Administrator by the testimony of some of his compilers. In the circumstances we think the Bulletin and other documents in question were evidence to be considered by the Administrator; that the weight to be given to them and the inferences to be drawn from them were for the Administrator and not the courts, and that they lend substantial support to his findings. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 126, 156]\n\u00a0\n Further contentions that the findings, and particularly the finding that classification in the industry is unnecessary, and the subsidiary findings as to differences in transportation, living, and production costs, are unsupported by substantial evidence are addressed either to the weight and dependability of the evidence supporting the findings or to the testimony of particular witnesses or conflicting evidence on which petitioner relies. We have examined these contentions and, without further elaboration of the details of the evidence, we conclude that the Administrator's findings are supported by substantial evidence. Any different conclusion would require us to substitute our judgment of the weight of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it for that of the Administrator which the statute forbids.\n Numerous other contentions are advanced by petitioner but they are subsidiary to those which we have already considered, or are of such slight moment as to call for no further discussion.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Here the Committee reconsidered its report, after the Administrator had redefined the industry on May 22, 1939, and again adopted its recommendations which had been agreed upon. \n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPALMER v.

The lease, demising respondent's street railway properties and equipment in Connecticut for 999 years from 1906, was rejected on December 18, 1935, by petitioners, the trustees of the debtor, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company. \n1\n The annual rent reserved at rejection was close to $1,050,000 with tax, sinking fund, interest \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 552]\n\u00a0\n and bond retirement adjustments, which are not material to our discussion.\n After rejection the lessor filed a claim for damages under sub- section b of Section 77. The applicable provisions are as follows:\n'... In case an executory contract or unexpired lease of property shall be rejected, ... any person injured by such ... rejection shall for all purposes of this section be deemed to be a creditor of the debtor to the extent of the actual damage or injury determined in accordance with principles obtaining in equity proceedings. ...'\n\n The claim was allowed, limited to the damages accrued or which might accrue before the winding up of the reorganization. This Court on a previous certiorari2 disapproved that measure of damages and laid down as the measure 'the present value of the rent reserved less the present rental value of the remainder of the term.' On remand to the district court, the lessor undertook to prove damages according to the approved measure by introducing evidence of the present value (January 1, 1936), at four per cent discount, of the rent reserved under the lease for forty years only (to December 31, 1975). This amounted to around twenty million dollars. For a corresponding period evidence of rental value similarly discounted was offered. The difference was submitted as the damages for rejection. No proof of rent reserved or rental value beyond the forty years was offered as respondent was advised such proof would be too uncertain to carry conviction.\n To prove rental value, respondent offered evidence of annual earnings for each of the forty years. These earnings were made up of the earning power of a sinking fund, plus an adjustment of the annual payments re- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 553]\n\u00a0\n quired by the lease to be made to the sinking fund, plus the operating profits of the transportation properties. For 1936-1938 the actual earnings were used. This was the period after rejection and before trial when the demised properties were operated by or for respondent. For 1939- 1975 earnings were estimated by alternative calculations of average annual earnings, before federal taxes, over four prior base periods each ending December 31, 1938: (1) the preceding year and a half of 100% bus operation ; (2) the three years of actual operation, following rejection, during which the transition from trolleys to buses had been completed; (3) ten years, 1929-1938, the accounts for which were partly reconstructed because before the reorganization the demised premises were utilized in conjunction with others not involved here; and, finally, (4) fourteen years, 1925-1938.3 The earning power of the sums in the sinking fund and the annual payments to it were assumed to be fixed. To get the rental value, these two fixed sums were added to the operating profit calculated from each of the four base periods. Since earnings were erratic, varying from $78,000 to $775,000 in the fourteen-year period, the annual rental value for the future varied according to the base used. Likewise, the damages calculated for forty years showed a range of from nine and a half to thirteen and a third million. It is substantially correct to say that no evidence in disagreement with the base figures was produced for the petitioner. Nor did petitioner introduce any evidence on its part to establish a different amount of damages.\n The district court refused to find future earnings by protecting the average earnings of any of the four base \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 554]\n\u00a0\n periods. It pointed out that in its view the 100% bus operation was too new and had coincided with too great a shrinkage of earnings to serve as a safe guide. The data for 1936-1938 were deemed unconvincing because they were derived in a substantial measure from trolley operations, now abandoned, and because the period was one of economic depression. The ten and the fourteen-year bases were disapproved as irrelevant because of trolley operation, and as speculative because of the impossibility of forecasting the relative frequency of profitable and unprofitable years from this past experience. The court pointed out that no evidence of transportation experts or surveys was offered to assist it in appraising possibilities of the development of the territory, of increased operating efficiency or the effects of consolidation. \n4\n Furthermore, the trial court was of the view that even with acceptable proof of annual rental value for forty years, or other period materially shorter than the unexpired term of the lease, no conclusion could be reached as to the present rental value of the remainder of the term, because that portion of the term beyond the reach of the proof offered might have profits or losses which would upset the calculations for earlier years. The district court then struck out the accrued damages of more than a million dollars allowed on the former hearing and set aside the provision of the same order permitting accrued damages to be proven up to the date of final hearing.\n The circuit court of appeals (109 F.2d 568, 571). was of the view that 'in effect, the law for purposes of damages treats a lease with 969 more years to run as if it were only for a term within the reach of fairly definite forecast.' It thought that the evidence of earnings over the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 555]\n\u00a0\n 14-year experience was adequate to enable it to draw a reasoned conclusion as to probable earnings for eleven years. For the three years, 1936-1938, these were known; for the other eight years, the average annual earnings for the preceding 14-year period were adopted. An allowance of the damages at time of rejection was made in the amount of $4,411,837.61.5\n The certiorari brings here the questions of whether proof of damages for a portion of an unexpired lease is sufficient to fix damages for the whole remaining term and whether the circuit court of appeals may allow damages on the sole basis of past earnings, evidence which the district judge has held does not satisfy his mind.\n First.-Litigation over a 999-year lease naturally brings up incidents difficult to reconcile with known and established legal formulae. Since conveyancers and business men alike have long utilized the characteristic provisions of leases to accomplish transfers of rights in real estate for extensive periods without payment of the purchase price, such long term agreements have become a well recognized legal implement, especially in corporate realty transactions and railroad consolidations and mergers. It reservations of rent, provisions for taxes and operation are firmly embedded in our financial, corporate and title structures. \n6\n Business and government alike are ac- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 556]\n\u00a0\n customed to fix the rental value of property for long term leases and the value of the lease over and above the rent reserved at varying periods of the term. \n7\n In pending railroad reorganizations, themselves, appraisals of rental values must be considered. \n8\n That such determinations recur with some frequency demonstrates their practical possibility.\n The petitioner contends, however, that evidence of rental value for a 40-year period, no matter how certain it may be, is inadequate to enable a court to establish the damages for the entire 969 remaining years. Its argument is that one cannot be sure the truncated portion will not show sufficient gain to absorb all losses. Since certain proof for distant years cannot be produced, this objection leaves the lessor to qualified opinion evidence as to annual rental value, discounted for the term to show present damage. Such an opinion necessarily \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 557]\n\u00a0\n proceeds from presumably adequate knowledge of what lessees, desiring but not requiring the facilities, would be willing to pay for a new lease and lessors, in a similar attitude toward renting, to accept for the remainder of the term. While such evidence is admissible for consideration in forming a judgment upon damages, it has little, if any, probative force beyond the immediate years. Certainly such opinion evidence alone cannot be permitted to fix rental value for purposes of damages in the indefinite future. The final objective of the proof is not how much the remainder is worth now but what damages the lessor has suffered. For this he is awarded compensation. The measure of that damage is rent less rental value, a matter of judgment to be reached in the light of pleading and proof supplemented by judicial knowledge.\n The law for purposes of damages does not treat a broken lease of a thousand years as though it ran only for a limited time, the damages for which are measurable. But since evidence of the damage is necessarily limited to a time of 'definite forecasts' the rule of rental value permits the use of data for only a limited number of years to determine damages. The number of years to be considered depends upon the fullness and quality of the evidence offered to establish the damages. Hence, whether a limited term beyond the reach of forecasts or the whole term is to be used as a base for rental value, the evidence of earnings would be projected the same number of years. This, we think, is what was meant by the circuit court of appeals when it treated the lease 'in effect' as one with a term within the range of predictability as to rental value.\n However nebulous the concept of a long lease may be, it is not a fiction but an actual instrument. Nothing appears in the record to suggest that the rental agreed upon was other than a reasonable return upon the value of the demised property, fairly negotiated. At the time \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 558]\n\u00a0\n the lease was executed, it is fair to assume the parties thought the annual rent reserved and rental value were the same. Without proof to the contrary only nominal damages would be allowed the claimant. And, until something else is shown, courts are entirely justified in assuming that for the long years ahead the rent and the rental value are the same. \n9\n As a consequence, evidence of rental value smaller in amount than the rent reserved for a term shorter than the remainder of the lease is, in the absence of testimony as to other years, proof of the damages for the years covered. Since the presumption is that the rent and rental value for the remainder of the term are the same, the damage proven is to be considered as all the damage for the rejection of the lease.\n Second. The petitioner also contends that the circuit court of appeals erred in setting aside the district court's decree refusing the claim on the ground that the evidence, detailed above, did not satisfy the mind as to the amount of damages. In the view of the trial court, there was a failure of proof. The correctness of the judgment of the appellate court in directing an allowance of the claim depends not upon its power, which we think is clear,10 but upon its conclusion as to the persuasive character of the evidence, whether it is too speculative, whether it showed the damage to reasonable certainty. As there was no significant dispute over the facts proven, the conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence was for the reviewing court. We deal, in this review, with the method of the proof of damages, not the measure. Narrowed even more, the issue is whether the evidence offered justifies an award, whether the quantum of proof produced forms an adequate basis for a reasoned judgment. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 559]\n\u00a0\n Future rental value cannot be susceptible of precise proof. As it depends, so far as the amount of damages for breach of a lease is concerned, upon future profits, it partakes of the nature of loss of earning capacity or of credit. To require proof of rental value approaching mathematical certitude would bar a recovery for an actual injury suffered. All that can be done is to place before the court such facts and circumstances as are available to enable an estimate to be made based upon judgment and not guesswork. \n11\n Every anticipatory breach of an obligation, and every appraisal of damage involving the present value of property involves a prediction as to what will occur in the future. Present market value of property is but the resultant of the prediction of many minds as to the usability of property and probable financial returns from that use, projected into the future as far as reasonable, intelligent men can foresee the future.\n The proof of future profits by the evidence of past profits in an established business gives a reasonable basis for a conclusion. \n12\n It is true that this business changed from trolley to bus within two years of the end of the base period and that management changed from lessee to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 560]\n\u00a0\n lessor but we think the fact of transportation in the same communities for more than a quarter of a century sufficed to give the operation the classification of an established business. Here different methods of operation or normal changes in the executive staffs do not seem sufficient to interfere with the probative value of past experience. Franchises and property of street railways and bus lines are difficult of appraisal. Nothing is more indicative of their value for lease or sale of the fee than past earnings. If we were to adopt the view that the interest conveyed is a defeasible fee,13 its defeasance dependent upon a condition such as nonpayment of annual instalments of the purchase price, the same difficulties exist. The unknown subtrahend would be the present value, instead of the rental value. Evidence of value would be made up of the items of proof. One of the most important of these, in the case of property such as here involved, would be past earnings.\n This Court has sustained recoveries for future profits over four years based solely upon evidence of the profits of an established business for the past four years. We there approved an instruction which told the jury, 'Damages are not rendered uncertain because they cannot be calculated with absolute exactness. It is sufficient if a reasonable basis of computation is afforded, although the result be only approximate'.14\n The ways compensatory damages may be proven are many. The injured party is not to be barred from a fair recovery by impossible requirements. The wrongdoer should not be mulcted, neither should he be permitted to escape under cover of a demand for nonexistent \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 561]\n\u00a0\n certainty. \n15\n Damages for breach of the lease were in contemplation of the parties when the contract was made. \n16\n The lease contained a covenant of reentry without prejudice to right of action for arrears of rent or breach of covenants. The provision in the Bankruptcy Act gives a new right of recovery in bankruptcy only. This right of recovery is an unsecured claim of the character of a claim for a deficiency above the value of inadequate collateral.\n Certainty in the fact of damage is essential. Certainty as to the amount goes no further than to require a basis for a reasoned conclusion17. The certainty of the evidence as to damages for rejection of a lease depends upon the same tests as in other situations where damages are difficult of proof. This Court, recently, in an infringement case18 was required to appraise the value of opinion evidence as to the part of profits attributable to the use of a pirated play, an obviously elusive fact. No expert thought any greater percentage than ten should be attributed to the play. The lower court allowed twenty so that the award might by no possibility be too small. We approved because 'what is required is not mathematical exactness but only a reasonable approximation. That, after all, is a matter of judgment ....'\n Satisfactory evidence was presented for the three years of actual operation of the properties covered by this lease. We think that prior earnings of the same property over fourteen years was a fair base to use to project the estimate of the earnings for the eight years of future \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 562]\n\u00a0\n operation. The failure to produce further evidence, either through experts or transportation surveys, was not fatal to respondent's case, even though such evidence is admissible. We see no reason to disagree with the conclusion of the circuit court of appeals that under the evidence presented the damages for eight years might be predicted with a 'fair degree of certainty.'\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER dissenting.\n On January 3, 1939, this Court unanimously decided that the 'actual damage or injury' caused the lessor through the disaffirmance by the trustees of the New Haven of the lease now in controversy was a provable claim. Connecticut Ry. & Lighting Co. v. Palmer, \n305 \nU.S. 493\n, 59 S.Ct. 316. If Congress had intended to rule out the legal provability of a claim for damages arising through the disaffirmance of what remains of a 999-year lease it could easily have done so, instead of providing for proof of the damages flowing from the termination of such an unexpired lease. And if, upon the prior consideration of the status of this very lease, this Court had intended to rule that loss due to the disaffirmance of the unexpired term of 969 years is in the nature of things beyond rational proof, it surely would not have taken twelve pages to avoid saying so. Both Congress and this Court have thus sponsored the conviction that proof of some damage is not outside the adjudicatory process.\n But what is to be assessed is the value of a terminated long-term lease and not the value of an included short-term. Therefore, neither the decision of the district court nor that of the circuit court of appeals in reversing it seems to me satisfactory. Although the two courts reached contradictory conclusions, their views appear to suffer from the same intrinsic vice. Starting with man's inability to pierce into a future of 969 years, both courts \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 563]\n\u00a0\n deemed the present value of a lease running for such a period beyond calculable forecast. Therefore, Judge Hincks said in effect, when an end is put to the benefits accruing from such a lease, the loss to the lessor cannot be translated into dollars and cents. Judge Patterson, on the other hand, treated the lease as though it were a lease for an ascertainable, included short term, and deemed eleven years as the limit for sure judgment. Since the lease is not a short-term lease, it is, according to the district court, nothing for purpose of giving rise to damages. Since the lease is for too long a term, we will snip off an included short term as though it were a short-term lease, concluded the circuit court of appeals.\n Both these dispositions result in avoidance, through over- simplification, of an extremely complicated problem which Congress has put up to the courts. Since neither the district court nor the circuit court of appeals applied the directions of this Court in Connecticut Ry. & Lighting Co. v. Palmer, supra, however difficult and subtle they may have been, neither disposition should stand. The case should be sent back to the district court where an opportunity should be given to make proofs appropriate to the nature of the problem to be solved, namely, ascertainment on a tough business basis of the damage that sprang into existence from the disaffirmance of the remaining 969-year term rather than from the disaffirmance of a supposed 11-year lease.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and I and of the view that respondent's proof was wholly inadequate to establish under  77, sub. b, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  205, sub. b, the extent of its 'actual damage or injury' as a result of the rejection of this lease, since the evidence offered failed to show what was 'the present value of the rent reserved less the present rental \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 564]\n\u00a0\n value. of the remainder of the term'-the measure of damages established for this very claim in Connecticut Railway & Lighting Company v. Palmer, \n305 \nU.S. 493, 504\n, 59 S.Ct. 316, 323.\n We are dealing here with an unexpired term of 969 years. But the claim allowed is for a term which does not cover that span. It covers only an unexpired term of 11 years. For the reasons stated in Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 445\n, 57 S.Ct. 298, we think that if Congress had provided in  77 that lessors should not be allowed to prove for damages in excess of an 11 year unexpired term, the limitation would be constitutional. Such legislation would have a firm constitutional basis in the bankruptcy power. But the making of such a limitation is a legislative, not a judicial, function. In view of the wording of  77, sub. b, we do not think this Court has the power to substitute the value of one property interest for the value of an entirely different one. Sec. 77, sub. b, says that 'actual damage or injury' shall be allowed. Yet it would be a mere coincidence if 'actual damage or injury' for an 11 year term were the 'actual damage or injury' for a 969 year term. Hence the District Court correctly refused to substitute any lesser term for the one here in question. No authority, we believe, can be found which can justify speculating a claimant into a loss through the easy assumption that he had a property interest which in fact he did not have.\n There is a related objection to the allowance of this claim. It is plain that any attempted computation of future rental values of this property for the next 969 years would at best be a mere flight 'into the realm of pure speculation' which this Court condemned when the case was here before. \n305 \nU.S. 493, 505\n, 59 S.Ct. 316, 324. From our point in history 969 years hence is perpetuity. It covers a longer span than from 1941 A.D. to 500 years before Columbus discovered America. To project past earnings of a present enterprise through such vicissitudes of time \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 565]\n\u00a0\n would be to assume a static quality in society which even a decade of history would disprove. This was tacitly admitted by respondent before the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals recognized the impossibility of such a task. It therefore produced a substitute method. It computed the annual estimated values for each future year for as long a period as it could venture an estimate. That, however, misses the nature of the problem. Under the rule laid down by this Court, the great unknown in such cases is the 'present rental value of the remainder of the term.' The actual damage, if any, to the lessor is suffered all at once. For  77, like former  77B, 11 U.S.C.A.  207 (City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 433, 440\n, 57 S.Ct. 292, 295) extends the doctrine of anticipatory breach (Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Association, \n240 \nU.S. 581\n, 36 S.Ct. 412, L.R.A.1917B, 580) to leases of realty. Where there is such a breach 'compensation therefor may be recovered at once for the whole loss, though the consequence be a continuing one, if the future damage resulting therefrom can be ascertained with certainty.' James v. Kibler's Adm'r, 94 Va. 165, 173, 26 S.E. 417, 418. The liability of the lessee for damages is single, knot multiple. But  77, sub. b, unlike some state rules (Hermitage Co. v. Levine, 248 N.Y. 333, 162 N.E. 97, 59 A.L.R. 1015), calls for an ascertainment of the full deficiency not at the end of the term but on rejection of the lease.\n Lessors claiming damages under  77, sub. b, like claimants in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings (Rasmussen v. Gresly, 8 Cir., 77 F.2d 252, 254; Whitney v. Dresser, \n200 \nU.S. 532\n, 26 S.Ct. 316), carry the burden of establishing the existence and amount of the claim. Their proof must satisfy the 'usual rules as to the measure of damages'; they 'must show damages to reasonable certainty'. Connecticut Railway & Lighting Company v. Palmer, supra, 305 U.S. at page 505, 59 S.Ct. at page 324. While absolute certainty is not required where a claim for damages is sought (Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 566]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n169 \nU.S. 26, 37\n, 18 S.Ct. 255, 259), the evidence must be sufficient for the exercise of an informed judgment as to the amount. Where the existence or extent of the damage is a matter of mere conjecture or guess work, the claim will be denied. Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City R. Co., 2 Cir., 198 F. 721, 759. When the instant case was here before, the Pennsylvania Steel Co. case was cited for the statement, 'The difficulties of proof are well recognized.' 305 U.S. at page 504, 59 S.Ct. at page 324. In the Pennsylvania Steel Co. case damages for breach of a lease with an unexpired term of 995 years were disallowed in receivership proceedings, the court saying (198 F. at page 759): 'Who could foretell the results of operation by the owner, the growth of the city, improvements in motive power, or reductions in cost? Who could foresee whether a lease could be made to another railroad company or the terms thereof? ... The claim for such damages was properly disallowed because it was uncertain in amount and there was no method of making it certain.'\n Those observations are peculiarly apt when applied to the facts in this record. Here there is no evidence as to market value. Cf. Metropolitan Bldg. Co. v. King County, 62 Wash. 409, 113 P. 1114, Ann.Cas. 1912C, 943. Nor has there been any fair, bona fide reletting. Cf. James v. Kibler's Adm'r, supra. In this record there is no substantial evidence as to value except estimated past earnings. Useful as past earnings may be in certain situations where a short and limited forecast is being made ( Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., \n273 \nU.S. 359\n, 47 S.Ct. 400) they are indeed treacherous when used as the sole basis for appraisal. \n1\n The value of a going enterprise is dependent on earnings. A forecast of earnings must take into consideration the numerous and variable fac- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 567]\n\u00a0\n tors which affect income-producing capacity. \n2\n Those factors vary from business to business. Here we are dealing with passenger transportation by bus. Certainly any forecast of earnings should embrace an expert study of problems peculiar to this field-the territory served, population trends, competitive conditions, the record of companies in comparable territory, and the like. Any estimate which wholly ignores such factors and relies entirely on past earnings ignores the very conditions which alone can impeach or sustain the credibility of past earnings as a measure of future earnings. \n3\n Cf. Hammond Lumber Co. v. County of Los Angeles, 104 Cal.App. 235, 285 P. 896.\n The problem of determining the present value of this unexpired term of 969 years is not different from the problem of valuing a fee interest.\n The fact that this instrument is called a 'lease' is no barrier to such an appraisal. For, as stated by this Court in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific R. Co., \n163 \nU.S. 564, 582\n, 16 S.Ct. 1173, 1180, where a so-called 'lease' was construed: 'What it was styled by the parties does not determine its character or their legal relations.' The court has not only the power but the duty to determine its real character by consideration of all its intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics. Id., 163 U.S. at page 582, 16 S.Ct. at page 1180. A lease renewable forever or a lease in perpetuity (as here) is the equivalent of a fee interest. It has been so treated in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 568]\n\u00a0\n Connecticut, where the instant lease was made, for purposes of taxation. Connecticut Spiritualist Camp-Meeting Association v. Town of East Lyme, 54 Conn. 152, 155, 156, 5 A. 849. As stated in Piper v. Meredith, 83 N.H. 107, 110, 139 A. 294, 296, 55 A.L.R. 148, 'it is well settled law that a perpetual lease upon condition conveys to the lessee a determinable or base fee.' Or as stated in Whittelsey v. Porter, 82 Conn. 95, 102, 72 A. 593, 596, a 999 year lease is 'practically a fee defeasible only upon failure to perform certain conditions.' And see Montgomery v. Town of Branford, 107 Conn. 697, 702, 142 A. 574; Wells v. Savannah, \n181 \nU.S. 531\n, 21 S.Ct. 697; Leary v. Jersey City, \n248 \nU.S. 328\n, 39 S.Ct. 115; Trustees of Elmira v. Dunn, 22 Barb., N.Y., 402. The mere reversionary interest of the lessor in a perpetual lease is so remote and speculative as to defy valuation. See Chicago West Division R. Co. v. Metropolitan West Side Elevated R. Co., 152 Ill. 519, 524-526, 38 N.E. 736. As stated by the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, the reversion under a 999 year lease becomes a 'mere imaginary estate'. Brainard v. Town of Colchester, 31 Conn. 407, 411. Whatever may be the precise catalogue of all rights of the lessee (Goodwin v. Goodwin, 33 Conn. 314; Dennis' Appeal, 72 Conn. 369, 44 A. 545) and whatever may have been the business and legal reasons for use of the 999 year lease rather than the acquisition of the assets by merger, consolidation or otherwise,4 it is plain that for all practical purposes the lessee retains such full control and such complete enjoyment of the property that he may properly be treated as the owner. Such a lease is in effect 'a practical sale'. Lord v. Town of Litchfield, 36 Conn. 116, 126, 4 Am.Rep. 41. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 544, 569]\n\u00a0\n Thus the problem of determining the present value of the unexpired term of 969 years is no different from determining the value of land in an action for breach of a contract to purchase it. There the rule is that the vendor may recover compensation for his actual loss measured by the difference between the price he was to receive5 (less the amount paid) and the value of the land at the time of breach. 3 Sedgwick on Damages, 9th Ed .,  1023 et seq.; In re Marshall's Garage, 2 Cir., 63 F.2d 759. In making that valuation the conventional rules governing appraisals of the worth of fee interests would be applicable. 1 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, chs. XIII, XIV.\n In sum, whatever rule of damages is applied to this situation, the proof submitted is not adequate for appraisal of the property interest here involved without violating the well-established rule against allowance of speculative damages, announced by this Court on the first appeal. No reasons of policy have been suggested which justify deviation from those well-established principles. The fact that the 'lease' extends over a period of almost ten centuries accentuates the necessity for close adherence to the rule, not for its relaxation. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The lease originally covered additional properties, but as to these the debtor no longer had an interest. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Connecticut Railway & Lighting Co. v.

In 1893 Old Colony leased its property, including its leasehold interest in the Boston and Providence property, to New Haven for a term of 99 years. Boston was then served by four railroads entering the city from the South and West: the two lessors, New England Railroad Company, and Boston and Albany Railroad Company.\n In 1896 Massachusetts, by a special act, incorporated the Boston Terminal Company,5 with power to construct and maintain a union passenger station in the southerly part of Boston, and to provide and operate terminal facilities 'for the several railroad companies' by the act 'authorized to hold the stock' of the company. The Act sets the capital stock at $500,000, and provides that Boston and Albany, New England, Boston and Providence, Old Colony, 'and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, being lessee of the Old Colony Railroad Company, may each subscribe for and hold' one-fifth thereof.\n The management of the company's affairs is vested in five trustees, one to be appointed by each of the five stockholding companies.\n All the named railroads, including the New Haven, are required to use the terminal for all their terminal \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n possenger business in Boston. They are to pay to the terminal company for such use the amounts needed to cover the company's expenses, including interest upon its bonds, and taxes. Each railroad is required to pay in proportion to its use, as agreed amongst them, or, in default of agreement, according to the proportion determined by the railroad commissioners (now the Department of Public Utilities).\n The real estate of the terminal company 'required by this act to be used by said railroad companies shall be assessed to and the taxes thereon shall be paid by said railroad companies, and in the assessment of franchies taxes upon said railroad companies each of them shall be deemed to be the owner of said real estate in the proportion in which it then has the use thereof under this act.'\n In 1905 New England was merged into New Haven. \n6\n Later Boston and Albany leased its property to the New York Central. Thereafter, in 1921, the Massachusetts Act of June 9, 1896, was amended7 to give the New York Central, as lessee, the right to hold stock of the terminal company and, during the term of the lease, to exercise all the powers by the Act conferred on Boston and Albany. The total use of the terminal thereafter was by New York Central, as lessee of Boston and Albany, by New Haven, as lessee of Old Colony, and by New Haven, as owner of the New England line. During the period involved in this case there was no use of the terminal by the New Haven trustees on behalf of the New England line. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n In 1931 the Department of Public Utilities of Massachusetts determined that the proportion of use of the union station and facilities was seventy per cent. by New Haven and thirty per cent. by New York Central. No reapportionment has since been made.\n New Haven filed its petition for reorganization in the District Court for Connecticut October 23, 1935. At that time the lines of Old Colony and Boston and Providence came into the custody of the court as a part of the New Haven system. The court directed continued operation of the system and appointed trustees. Old Colony filed its petition for reorganization in the New Haven proceeding June 3, 1936, and the court appointed the same persons trustees as had been appointed upon the New Haven petition. Boston and Providence initiated a reorganization proceeding in the District Court for Massachusetts August 5, 1938, and trustees of its property were appointed by that court. The New Haven trustees disaffirmed and rejected the Old Colony lease June 2, 1936, and the trustees of Old Colony rejected the Boston and Providence lease July 19, 1938. Under orders of the District Court for Connecticut, made pursuant to the provisions of  77(c)( 6), the New Haven trustees have continued to operate both Old Colony and Boston and Providence railroads for the account of the former lessors. \n9\n The trustees have kept their accounts covering the operations of the two lines according to a segregation and allocation of expenses and revenues approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and by the District Court and confirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n10\n In the accounting, the seventy per cent. of the use of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n the terminal facilities formerly charged to New Haven as lessee is charged by the trustees to Old Colony and Boston and Providence operations in proportion to use.\n The trustees' operation of Old Colony and Boston and Providence properties has resulted in losses exceeding $20,000,000 in the period between October 23, 1935, and December 31, 1939. This excess of expenditures over receipts is secured by liens on the properties. Payment of the taxes and bond interest of Boston Terminal Company has required cash advances increasing the accumulating deficit at the rate of approximately $800,000 per annum. The trustees believe that the properties of the lessors are insufficient to secure repayment of further cash advances by the New Haven estate and that to make them will jeopardize the claims of New Haven's own secured creditors. In a petition of October 17, 1939, they set forth the facts and stated their view that they should not make further advances for payment of Boston Terminal taxes and bond interest for the account of the Old Colony and Boston and Providence estates. Notice of hearing was given and a number of interested parties appeared. The District Court announced its opinion and entered an order, October 30, 1939, directing the trustees to withhold the payments in question. Old Colony Trust Company, the trustee under the mortgage of the terminal company, appealed. The appeal was prosecuted in the Circuit Court of Appeals by its successor trustee, Webster and Atlas National Bank, the respondent in this court.\n The District Court overruled the contention that  77(c)(6) imposes an obligation on the trustees of New Haven in behalf of creditors of the lessors. The court held that the section requires the continued operation of the lessors' property, if the lessors are unable to operate, in the interest of the public. It called attention to the fact that the section provides that the operation is to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n be 'for the account of the lessor' and that no claim was made that failure to pay the interest or taxes in question would result in the suspension of operation of Old Colony and Boston and Providence lines. The court further held, on an analysis of the Massachusetts statute creating the terminal company, that any direct obligation on the part of New Haven to pay interest and taxes terminated with the rejection of the Old Colony lease which related back to the date of the petition for reorganization, since which time the trustees have not operated for their own account but for that of the former lessors. The court thought that upon plain principles of equity it ought not to jeopardize the interests of New Haven's secured creditors by imposing the probable loss upon the New Haven estate.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals declined to pass upon the question whether  77(c)(6), of its own force, requires the New Haven trustees to make the payments as operating expenses of the former lessors, though payment is not indispensable to the continuance of railroad operations, and declined to decide whether the direct obligations imposed by the Massachusetts statute upon New Haven bound the trustees of New Haven after rejection of the leases. The court based its reversal of the District Court's order upon two federal statutes.\n It held that the Act of June 18, 1934,11 which provides that 'Any receiver, liquidator, referee, trustee, or other officers or agents appointed by any United States court who is authorized by said court to conduct any business, or who does conduct any business, shall, from and after June 18, 1934, be subject to all State and local taxes applicable to such business the same as if such business were conducted by an individual or corporation ...', lays upon the trustees the obligation to pay the taxes in question. We are unable to agree. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n The question is whether the trustees, who are officers or agents appointed by the court to conduct the business of New Haven, are also, within the intendment of the statute, agents who are conducting the business of Old Colony. Stated otherwise, the inquiry is whether, in adopting the statute, Congress had in view an enforced operation of a lessor's property by the trustees of the lessee under  77(c)(6) to prevent stoppage of railroad transportation. We think Congress had no such intent.\n The legislative history of the Act discloses its purpose. The committee reports accompanying the bill which became the Act of 1934 state: 12 'The purpose of this bill is to subject businesses conducted under receivership in Federal court to State and local taxation the same as if such businesses were being conducted by private individuals or corporations.' The reports advert to the fact that federal courts had held a federal receiver operating a business exempt from state sales taxes. They conclude: 'No good reason is perceived why a receiver should be permitted to operate under such an advantage as against his competitors not in receivership, and the States and local governments be deprived of this revenue.'\n What Congress intended was that a business in receivership, or conducted under court order, should be subject to the same tax liability as the owner would have been if in possession and operating the enterprise. In the light of this purpose, the Act does not impose upon the New Haven trustees the obligation to pay taxes arising out of the conduct of the business of Old Colony or Boston and Providence.  77(c)(2) accords the trustees of a railroad in reorganization the right to reject burdensome leases.  77(c)(6) provides \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n that if a lease of a line of railroad is so rejected it shall be the duty of the lessor to operate the line unless it be found impracticable for the lessor so to do, 'in which event it shall be the duty of the lessee to continue operation on or for the account of the lessor.' The taxes in question are, in the words of the Act of 1934, 'applicable to' the business of Old Colony, and Boston and Providence. The New Haven trustees having rejected the Old Colony lease, they are no longer applicable, in any proper sense, to the business of New Haven.\n By  77(c)(2) the trustees of a railroad in reorganization are given power to operate 'the business of the debtor'. By subsection (c)(4) the trustees are required to file schedules and information disclosing 'the conduct of the debtor's affairs'. The New Haven trustees' duty is to conduct the business of New Haven. Old Colony petitioned for reorganization and trustees were appointed in that proceeding as 'trustees of the property of Old Colony Railroad Company', and were granted, pursuant to  77, power to operate 'the business of Old Colony Railroad Company'. The trustees of Old Colony, as such, are the persons who, in the language of the statute, are 'authorized by said court to conduct' the 'business' of Old Colony.\n Upon the petition of a creditor for the reorganization of Boston and Providence, which alleged that company was a common carrier by railroad engaged in the transportation of persons and property in interstate commerce, and that the Connecticut District Court had ordered the operation of its line to be continued by the New Haven trustees for the account of Boston and Providence, and upon the company's admission of the truth of the allegations of the petition, the Massachusetts District Court approved the petition and appointed trustees for the property of Boston and Providence. The appointment was confirmed by the Interstate Commerce Commission \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n and the trustees are in office. As in the case of Old Colony, these trustees are the persons who are conducting the business of Boston and Providence and not the New Haven trustees.\n If the trustees of either of the lessor's properties were able to operate the lines of railroad and from the proceeds of that operation, or from any other source, were in possession of available funds, it would be the duty of the court in view of the Act of 1934 to require them to pay the taxes applicable to the business they are conducting under the orders of the court. But it does not follow that the New Haven trustees, who are not conducting the business of Old Colony or Boston and Providence, as such, but who, under the constraint of  77(c)(6), are merely operating the lines of those companies to prevent public inconvenience are, in the contemplation of the Act of 1934, conducting the business of the lessors in such sense as to be liable, out of New Haven estate funds, for taxes owned by those companies. It would require very clear and explicit language to evince an intent on the part of Congress to appropriate the moneys of the New Haven estate, which has rejected the Old Colony lease and rid itself of the leasehold interest thereby created, to pay the taxes of its lessor. We find in the Act of 1934 no such clear expression. On the contrary we think it plain Congress did not have in mind, in adopting that statute, any such situation as is created by  77(c)(6).\n The Court of Appeals was of opinion that an obligation is imposed upon the New Haven trustees to pay the bond interest of the terminal company by  65 of the Judicial Code,13 which provides:\n'Whenever in any cause pending in any court of the United States there shall be a receiver or manager in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n possession of any property, such receiver or manager shall manage and operate such property according to the requirements of the valid laws of the state in which such property shall be situated, in the same manner that the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do if in possession thereof. Any receiver or manager who shall willfully violate any provision of this section shall be fined not more than $3,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.'\n\n The court held the statute applicable by regarding its letter, and, as we think, ignoring its obvious purpose. In the words of the statute, the trustees of the New Haven are 'in possession' of certain property belonging to Old Colony, and Boston and Providence. They also are operating that property. Hence the Court of Appeals concluded that the Massachusetts Act of 1896,-a valid law placing upon New Haven an obligation to pay the bond interest of the terminal company,-binds the trustees, so long as they operate the properties, to comply with the New Haven's statutory obligation.\n Section 65 is not a new enactment. It has its origin in  2 of the Act of March 3, 188714 and it has frequently been interpreted and applied by the courts. \n15\n Its obvious purpose was to negative the idea that a federal receiver or trustee could ignore the rules of law of the state of operation affecting the conduct of the business committed to his charge. In this sense it has been interpreted and applied and, in this sense, it is certainly binding upon the trustees of New Haven so long as they operate the property of the former lessors. The application of the Act by the court below goes much farther \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 167]\n\u00a0\n than this. If valid state laws require a debtor to pay his debts then, under the decision of the Court, such laws bind the New Haven trustees to pay the debts of Old Colony, and Boston and Providence. If this view were correct, the trustees would not be operating the property of those companies for the account of the latter as  77(c)(6) provides. On the contrary, they would be operating for the account of the New Haven estate. Moreover, on this assumption, the New Haven estate would be compelled to pay the former lessors' debts as they accrued. The result would be a preference of the creditors of the confessedly insolvent lessors as against the creditors of the New Haven whose trustees are operating the Boston and Providence and Old Colony property only under the constraint of  77(c)(6). We think that to state the proposition is to demonstrate that  65 of the Judicial Code has no such purpose or effect.\n We are of opinion, as was the District Court, that nothing in  77(c)( 6) works the inequitable result that the involuntary operation of the Old Colony, and Boston and Providence properties by the New Haven trustees requires them to advance New Haven's funds, without security, for the payment of obligations of the former lessors which are not essential to the continued operation demanded of the trustees.\n How far cash advances to the former lessors should go; whether the security for further advances is adequate; whether advances are necessary to continued operation; are all questions to be decided by the District Court having jurisdiction of the New Haven reorganization proceedings. These are problems of administration to be solved by the exercise of a sound discretion. Upon the uncontested facts, we think the District Court exercised such a discretion in ordering the withholding of further cash payments towards the taxes and interest of the terminal company, and that its order should stand. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 156, 168]\n\u00a0\n The District Court discussed at some length the provisions of the Massachusetts Act of 1896 chartering the terminal company. The respondent insists that the court erroneously construed the Act and held that it will not sustain any claim on the part of the terminal company, or the State or the City of Boston, against the New Haven estate in respect of the interest on the terminal company's bonds and taxes assessed on its property and franchises. The trustees' petition sought an order dealing only with the current administration of the New Haven estate and the District Court need not have decided, and we think did not decide, any question other than that presented. In any event, no question of the validity of any such claim is presented on this record and our affirmance of the District Court's order is not to be taken as the expression of an opinion upon any such question.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11 U.S.C.  205, 11 U.S.C.A.  205. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The order also directed the trustees to withhold payment of taxes approximating $613,000 due by Old Colony Railroad Company, and Boston and Providence Railroad Corporation to Massachusetts, and taxes approximating $ 76,000 due by the same companies to Rhode Island.

Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Minitree Jones Fulton, of Richmond, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n August 18, 1938, George Armistead was drowned when a motor boat in which he was riding capsized on the James \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n River off Richmond, Virginia. The boat was navigated by one Johnnie Cooper. Both Armistead and Cooper were employees of the respondent, Motor Boat Sales, Incorporated, which sold small boats, maritime supplies, and outboard motors. The object of the illfated boat trip was to test one of the respondent's outboard motors, which it desired to sell, and later did sell, to the owner of the boat. The petitioner, Deputy Commissioner of the United States Employees' Compensation Commission, under authority of Section 19 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, 1435, 33 U.S.C.A.  919, after complaint, investigation, and hearings, ordered the respondent to pay compensation to Armistead's widow for the benefit of herself and three minor children. Among the findings on which the Deputy based his order were these: that Armistead's death by drowning, 'arose out of and in the course of his employment; that his death occurred upon navigable waters; and that at the time of his death he was engaged in maritime employment.' Section 21(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A .  921(b), provides that if a Deputy Commissioner's award is not made in accordance with law, Federal District Courts may enjoin enforcement of it upon petition of any party in interest. In proceedings initiated by the respondent under this section, the District Court sustained the award, dismissing the bill on the ground that the findings of fact were supported by evidence and were therefore conclusive, and that the Commissioner's conclusions and award were in accordance with law. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, advancing two reasons for its conclusion: (1) Armistead was not acting in the course of his employment at the time of the accident; and (2) even if he had been, recovery was barred by Section 3(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A.  903(a), making compensation payable 'only if ... recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.'\n\n\n (1)\n The Circuit Court's conclusion that Armistead was not acting in the course of his employment rests upon a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n revaluation of the evidence before the Deputy Commissioner. It is true that the respondent's president testified that 'George was cautioned never to go into a boat or have anything to do with a boat or motor', but this rule was laid down 'prior to November 1937' and the accident occurred in August, 1938. Against whatever inferences to be drawn from testimony regarding this general and rather remotely announced rule are the inferences to be drawn from testimony that on the morning of the accident Armistead was sent to the river with specific instructions to help Cooper in placing the outboard motors on the boat: that there were no specific instructions as to whether or not Armistead was to stay out of the boat; that either Armistead or Cooper was told that Armistead was 'to go and help' Cooper; that Cooper, the superior of the two employees, at least acquiesced in Armistead's remaining in the boat to 'keep a lookout' for hidden objects in the muddy water; that Cooper regarded Armistead's acting as look out as 'helpful'; that employees of the respondent would sometimes make trips in boats for testing purposes, in furtherance of respondent's business; and that in one such instance an employee had taken a boat on a trip of at least fifty miles in respondent's behalf. Granting that more than one possible conclusion could have been reached upon the evidence, we think it was clearly sufficient to support the Deputy Commissioner's finding that Armistead was acting in the course of his employment. The Circuit Court of Appeals should therefore have accepted it as final. Voehl v. Indemnity Ins. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 162\n, 53 S.Ct. 380, 87 A.L.R. 245.\n\n\n (2)\n The Circuit Court (116 F.2d 789, 793), was of the opinion that even if Armistead had acted in the course of his employment, the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act would not apply because his employment was 'so local in character' that Virginia could validly have included it under a state workmen's compensation act. This proposition cannot be rested on the ground that Armistead, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n hired primarily as a janitor and porter, was predominantly a non-maritime employee. For habitual performance of other and different duties on land cannot alter the fact that at the time of the accident he was riding in a boat on a navigable river, and it is in connection with that clearly maritime activity1 that the award was here made. Cf. Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142, 144\n, 49 S.Ct. 88; Employers' Liability Assurance Corp. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 233, 236\n, 50 S.Ct. 308, 309. Moreover, Section 2(4) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A.  902(4), expressly provides for its application to 'employees (who) are employed ... in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States.'\n If the conclusion of the Circuit Court can be supported at all, it must be on the basis that the employment, even though maritime and therefore within an area in which Congress could have established exclusive federal jurisdiction, is nevertheless subject to state regulation until Congress has exercised its paramount power. Cf. Employers' Liability Assurance Corp. v. Cook, supra, 281 U.S. page 237, 50 S.Ct. page 309. Congress having expressly kept out of the area in which 'recovery ... may ... validly be provided by State law,' the argument may be made that Virginia would have been unhampered in providing for compensation here.\n The decision of this Court in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A.1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900, however, severs a link in this chain of reasoning. For under the holding of that case, even in the absence of any Congressional action,2 federal jurisdic- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n tion is exclusive and state action forbidden in an area, which, although of shadowy limits,3 doubtless embraces the case before us. The basis of the decision, that Article III,  2, of the Constitution extending the judicial power of the United States 'to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction' is tantamount to a command that no state may interfere with the harmony and uniformity of admiralty law, and that on the facts of that case recovery under a state statute would work such an interference, was rejected by four dissenting members of the Court. And when the doctrine of the Jensen case was reaffirmed in Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S.Ct. 438, 11 A.L.R. 1145, and Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S.Ct. 302, sharp disagreement was again expressed in dissenting opinions. We have not been called upon here, however, to reconsider the constitutional principles announced in those cases, and we are convinced that such a reconsideration is not necessary for disposition of the case before us.\n What we are called upon to decide is not of constitutional magnitude. For regardless of whether or not the limitation on the power of states set out in the Jensen case is to be accepted, it is not doubted that Congress could constitutionally have provided for recovery under a federal statute in this kind of situation. The question is whether Congress has so provided in this statute. The proviso of Section 3(a) aside, there would be no difficulty whatever in concluding it has. For the Act expressly includes within its ambit accidents 'arising out of and in the course of employment' in the case of employees engaged 'in \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States', and Armistead's death was the result of such an accident. While the proviso of Section 3(a) appears to be a subtraction from the scope of the Act thus outlined by Congress, we believe that, properly interpreted, it is not a large enough subtraction to place this case outside the coverage which Congress intended to provide.\n In the report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary accompanying the bill which was enacted as the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, S.R. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 16, this avowal of Congressional purpose appears:\n'If longshoremen could avail themselves of the benefits of State compensation laws, there would be no occasion for this legislation; but, unfortunately, they are excluded from these laws by reason of the character of their employment; and they are not only excluded but the Supreme Court has more than once held that Federal legislation can not, constitutionally, be enacted that will apply State laws to this occupation . (Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n (37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A.1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900); Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n (40 S.Ct. 438, 11 A.L.R. 1145); Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n (44 S.Ct. 302 )).\n\n'It thus appears that there is no way of giving to these hardworking men, engaged in a somewhat hazardous employment, the justice involved in the modern principle of compensation without enacting a uniform compensation statute.'\n\n There can be no doubt that the purpose of the Act was to provide for federal compensation in the area which the specific decisions referred to placed beyond the reach of the states. The proviso permitting recovery only where compensation 'may not validly be provided by State law' cannot be read in a manner that would defeat this \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 250]\n\u00a0\n purpose. An interpretation which would enlarge or contract the effect of the proviso in accordance with whether this Court rejected or reaffirmed the constitutional basis of the Jensen and its companion cases cannot be acceptable. The result of such an interpretation would be to subject the scope of protection that Congress wished to provide, to uncertainties that Congress wished to avoid.\n The main impetus for the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was the need to correct a gap made plain by decisions of this Court We believe that there is only one interpretation of the proviso in Section 3(a) which would accord with the aim of Congress; the field in which a state may not validly provide for compensation must be taken, for the purposes of the Act, as the same field which the Jensen line of decision excluded from state compensation laws. Without affirming or rejecting the constitutional implications of those cases, we accept them as the measure by which Congress intended to mark the scope of the Act they brought into existence.\n\n\n (3)\n The respondent further contends that the award was void under Section 5 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A.  905. This section, set out in full in the margin below, 4 states that 'an injured em- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 244, 251]\n\u00a0\n ployee, or his legal representative in case death results from the injury, may elect to claim compensation under this Act (chapter) ....' The record does not indicate that a 'legal representative' of Armistead was ever appointed. Here the claim was filed by his widow. Since the respondent did not contest the widow's capacity to file a claim either before the Deputy Commissioner or in the District Court, the objection, even if otherwise meritorious, was made too late. Cf. McCandless v. Furlaud, \n293 \nU.S. 67\n, 55 S.Ct. 42. We may nevertheless point out that the widow's asserted incapacity to sue in her own name can be derived only inferentially from the terms of Section 5, and that other sections of the Act are not in harmony with this inference. Section 12, 33 U.S.C.A.  912, provides that notice of death may be given 'by any person claiming to be entitled to compensation for such death or by a person on his behalf.' Section 19(a) provides that 'Subject to the provisions of section 13 (913 of this chapter) a claim for compensation may be filed ... in accordance with regulations prescribed by the commission', and there is nothing in Section 13 which makes filing by a 'personal representative' mandatory. Moreover, administrative practice apparently countenances the filing of claims by widows since the commission has prescribed printed forms bearing the caption: 'Claim for Compensation in Death Case by Widow and for Children under the Age of Eighteen.' Form US- 262.\n We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and affirm that of the District Court. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

Reference to  9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was made only for the purpose of pointing out that a clause embodied in it, which saved certain common law remedies, 'had no application.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf.: 'In view of these constitutional provisions and the Federal act it would be difficult, if not impossible, to define with exactness just how far the general maritime law may be changed, modified, or affected by state legislation.

THOMPSON(1941)\nNo. 687\nArgued: April 3, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 109, 110]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William J. McFarland and Ray L. Chesebro, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 109, 111]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of California, Ch. 390, Statutes of 1933, p. 1011, as amended by Ch. 665, Statutes of 1935, p. 1833, defines a transportation agent as one who 'sells or offers for sale, or negotiates for' transportation over the public highways of the state,  2, and requires every such agent to procure a license from the State Railroad Commission authorizing him so to act. By  6, 7 and 8, prerequisites to the license are determination by the Commission of the applicant's fitness to exercise the licensed privilege, the payment of a license fee of $1, and the filing by the applicant of a bond in the sum of $1,000, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the transportation contracts which he negotiates. By  16 any person acting as a transportation agent without a license is guilty of a misdemeanor. The question for decision is whether the statutory exaction of the license and bond infringes the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3, when applied to one who negotiates for the transportation interstate of passengers over the public highways of the state.\n Respondent was convicted of violation of the statute by arranging for the transportation by motor vehicle, of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 109, 112]\n\u00a0\n passengers from Los Angeles, California, to Dallas, Texas, by one who, so far as appears, made only the single trip in question. The state appellate court reversed the judgment of conviction, holding on the authority of Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34\n, 47 S.Ct. 267, that the statute as applied infringes the Commerce Clause. We granted certiorari February 17, 1941, \n312 \nU.S. 672\n, 61 S.Ct. 711, 85 L.Ed. --, the question, considered in the light of our decisions since the Di Santo case, sustaining state regulations affecting interstate transportation by motor vehicle, being of importance.\n Congress has not undertaken to regulate the acts for which respondent was convicted or the interstate transportation to which they related. The Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.  301-327, 49 U.S.C.A .  301-327, which applies to certain classes of common and contract interstate carriers by motor vehicle, excludes from its operation the casual or occasional transportation by motor vehicle of passengers in interstate commerce by persons not engaged in such transportation as a regular occupation or business,  303(b)(9). Hence we are concerned here only with the constitutional authority of the state to regulate those who, within the state, aid or participate in a form of interstate commerce over which Congress has not undertaken to exercise its regulatory power.\n The statute is not a revenue measure. Cf. Texas Transport & Terminal Co. v. New Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S.Ct. 242, 34 A.L.R. 907. It applies alike to transportation agents who negotiate for transportation intrastate as well as interstate and so does not discriminate against interstate commerce. Cf. Real Silk Hosiery Mills v. Portland, \n268 \nU.S. 325\n, 45 S.Ct. 525. It does not appear that the regulation will operate to increase the cost of the transportation or in respects not already indicated affect interstate commerce. It is not shown to be other than wha on its face it appears to be, a measure to safeguard the members of the public desiring to secure transporta- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 109, 113]\n\u00a0\n tion by motor vehicle, who are peculiarly unable to protect themselves from fraud and overreaching of those engaged in a business notoriously subject to those abuses.\n As this Court has often had occasion to point out, the Commerce Clause, in conferring on Congress power to regulate commerce, did not wholly withdraw from the states the power to regulate matters of local concern with respect to which Congress has not exercised its power, even though the regulation affects interstate commerce. Ever since Willson v. Blackbird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245, and Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, 12 How. 299, it has been recognized that there are matters of local concern, the regulation of which unavoidably involves some regulation of interstate commerce, but which because of their local character and their number and diversity may never be adequately dealt with by Congress. Because of their local character, also, there is wide scope for local regulation without impairing the uniformity of control of the national commerce in matters of national concern and without materially obstructing the free flow of commerce which were the principal objects sought to be secured by the Commerce Clause. Notwithstanding the Commerce Clause, such regulation in the absence of Congressional action has, for the most part, been left to the states by the decisions of this Court, subject only to other applicable constitutional restraints.

Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 185-191, 58 S.Ct. 510, 513-517, and cases cited.\n The present case is not one of prohibiting interstate commerce or licensing it on conditions which restrict or obstruct it. Cf. Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47\n, 11 S.Ct. 851; Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.Ct. 106. For here the regulation is applied to one who is not himself \n\n[313 \nU.S. 109, 115]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the transportation but who acts only as broker or intermediary in negotiating a transportation contract between the passengers and the carrier. The license required of those engaged in such business is not conditioned upon any control or restriction of the movement of the traffic interstate but only on the good character and responsibility of those engaged locally as transportation brokers.\n Fraudulent or unconscionable conduct of those so engaged which is injurious to their patrons, is peculiarly a subject of local concern and the appropriate subject of local regulation. In every practical sense regulation of such conduct is beyond the effective reach of Congressional action. Unless some measure of local control is permissible, it must go largely unregulated. In any case until Congress undertakes its regulation we can find no adequate basis for saying that the Constitution, interpreted as a working instrument of government, has foreclosed regulation, such as the present, by local authority.\n In Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, this Court took a different view. Following what it conceived to be the reasoning of McCall v. California, \n136 \nU.S. 104\n, 10 S.Ct. 881, it held that a Pennsylvania statute requiring others than railroad or steamship companies, who engage in the intrastate sale of steamship tickets or of orders for transportation to and from foreign countries, to procure a license by giving proof of good moral character and filing a bond as security against fraud and misrepresentation to purchasers, was an infringement of the Commerce Clause. Since the decision in that case this Court has been repeatedly called upon to examine the constitutionality of numerous local regulations affecting interstate motor vehicle traffic. It has uniformly held that in the absence of pertinent Congressional legislation there is constitutional power in the states to regulate interstate commerce by \n\n[313 \nU.S. 109, 116]\n\u00a0\n motor vehicle wherever it affects the safety of the public or the safety and convenient use of its highways, provided only that the regulation does not in any other respect unnecessarily obstruct interstate commerce.

Enright's Estate, \n312 \nU.S. 636\n, 61 S.Ct. 777, 85 L.Ed. --, decided today. Petitioners are the executors of a deceased physician who during 1935 was a member of a medical partnership and entitled to forty per cent of its profits. He died December 25, 1935, on which date there were outstanding about $69,000 of partnership accounts receivable for services rendered to patients during his lifetime. His death worked a dissolution of the partnership under  62( 4) of the New York Partnership Law, Consol.Laws, c. 39. The decedent's interest in these ac- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 646, 647]\n\u00a0\n counts came to over $27,000. Both he and the partnership were on a cash basis. Pursuant to section 42 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  42, and article 42(1) of Treasury Regulations 86, the commissioner included the decedent's share of the accounts receivable in his 1935 income, though only at about one-fifth of face value. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the commissioner's view of the statute, and also ruled that the valuation of the decedent's interest in the accounts at one- fifth of face value was amply supported. The Circuit Court of Appeals, without writing an opinion, affirmed the Board. 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 114.

Thomas E. Harris, of Washington, D.C., and Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., for National Labor Relations Board.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The dominating question which this litigation brings here for the first time is whether an employer subject to the National Labor Relations Act may refuse to hire employees solely because of their affiliations with a labor union. Subsidiary questions grow out of this central issue relating to the means open to the Board to 'effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)', if it finds such discrimination in hiring an 'unfair labor practice'. Other questions touching the remedial powers of the Board are also involved. We granted a petition by the Phelps Dodge Corporation and a cross-petition by the Board, \n312 \nU.S. 669\n, 61 S.Ct. 447, 85 L.Ed. --; \n312 \nU.S. 669\n, 61 S.Ct. 450, 85 L.Ed. --, to review a decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 113 F.2d 202, which enforced the order of the Board, 19 N.L.R.B., p. 547, with modifications. The main issue is intrinsically important and has stirred a conflict of decisions. National Labor Relations Board v. Waumbec Mills, 1 Cir., 114 F. 2d 226.\n The source of the controversy was a strike, begun on June 10, 1935, by the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers at Phelps Dodge's Copper Queen Mine, Bisbee, Arizona. Picketing of the mine continued until August 24, 1935, when the strike terminated. During the strike, the National Labor Relations Act came into f rce. Act of July 5, 1935, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. The basis of the Board's conclusion that the Corporation had committed unfair labor practices in violation of  8(3) of the Act was a finding, not challenged here, that a number of men had been refused employment \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 182]\n\u00a0\n because of their affiliations with the Union. Of these men, two, Curtis and Daugherty, had ceased to be in the Corporation's employ before the strike but sought employment after its close. The others, thirty-eight in number, were strikers. To 'effectuate the policies' of the Act,  10(c), the Board order the Corporation to offer Curtis and Daugherty jobs and to make them whole for the loss of pay resulting from the refusal to hire them, and it ordered thirty-seven of the strikers reinstated with back pay, and the other striker made whole for loss in wages up to the time he became unemployable. Save for a modification presently to be discussed, the Circuit Court of Appeals enforced the order affecting the strikers but struck down the provisions relating to Curtis and Daugherty.\n First. The denial of jobs to men because of union affiliations is an old and familiar aspect of American industrial relations. Therefore, in determining whether such discrimination legally survives the National Labor Relations Act, the history which led to the Act and the aims which infuse it give direction to our inquiry. Congress explicitly disclosed its purposes in declaring the policy which underlies the Act. Its ultimate concern, as well as the source of its power, was 'to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce'. This vital national purpose was to be accomplished 'by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association'.  1. Only thus could workers ensure themselves economic standards consonant with national well-being. Protection of the workers' right to self-organization does not curtail the appropriate sphere of managerial freedom; it furthers the wholesome conduct of business enterprise. 'The act', this Court has said, 'does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the employer to select \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 183]\n\u00a0\n its employees or to discharge them'. But 'under cover of that right', the employer may not 'intimidate or coerce its employees with respect to their self-organization and representation.' When 'employers freely recognize the right of their employees to their own organizations and their unrestricted right of representation there will be much less occasion for controversy in respect to the free and appropriate exercise of the right of selection and discharge'. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 45\n, 46 S., 57 S.Ct. 615, 628, 108 A.L.R. 1352. This is so because of the nature of modern industrialism. Labor unions were organized 'out of the necessities of the situation. ... Union was essential to give laborers opportunity to deal on equality with their employer'. Such was the view, on behalf of the Court, of Chief Justice Taft, American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360, after his unique practical experience with the causes of industrial unrest as co- chairman of the National War Labor Board. And so the present Act, codifying this long history, leaves the adjustment of industrial relations to the free play of economic forces but seeks to assure that the play of those forces be truly free.\n It is no longer disputed that workers cannot be dismissed from employment because of their union affiliations. Is the national interest in industrial peace less affected by discrimination against union activity when men are hired? The contrary is overwhelmingly attested by the long history of industrial conflicts, the diagnosis of their causes by official investigations, the conviction of public men, industrialists and scholars. n1 Because of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 184]\n\u00a0\n the Pullman strike, Congress in the Erdman Act of 1898 prohibited inroads upon the workingman's right of association by discriminatory practices at the point of hiring. \n2\n Kindred legislation has been put on the statute books of more than half the states. \n3\n And during the late war the National War Labor Board concluded that discrimination against union men at the time of hiring violated its declared policy that 'The right of workers to organize in trade-unions and to bargain collectively ... \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 185]\n\u00a0\n shall not be denied, abridged, or interfered with by the employers in any manner whatsoever'.4 Such a policy is an inevitable corollary of the principle of freedom of organization. Discrimination against union labor in the hiring of men is a dam to self organization at the source of supply. The effect of such discrimination is not confined to the actual denial of employment; it inevitably operates against the whole idea of the legitimacy of organization. In a word, it undermines the principle which, as we have seen, is recognized as basic to the attainment of industrial peace.\n These are commonplaces in the history of American industrial relations. But precisely for that reason they must be kept in the forefront in ascertaining the meaning of a major enactment dealing with these relations. To be sure, in outlawing unfair labor practices, Congress did not leave the matter at large. The practices condemned 'are strictly limited to those enumerated in section 8', S.Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8. Section 8(3) is the foundation of the Board's determination that in refusing employment to the two men because of their union affiliations Phelps Dodge violated the Act. And so we turn to its provisions that 'It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer ... By discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization'.\n Unlike mathematical symbols, the phrasing of such social legislation as this seldom attains more than approximate precision of definition. That is why all relevant aids are summoned to determine meaning. Of compelling \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 186]\n\u00a0\n consideration is the fact that words acquire scope and function from the history of events which they summarize. We have seen the close link between a bar to employment because of union affiliation and the opportunities of labor organizations to exist and to prosper. Such an embargo against employment of union labor was notoriously one of the chief obstructions to collective bargaining through self-organization. Indisputably the removal of such obstructions was the driving force behind the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act. The prohibition against 'discrimination in regard to hire' must be applied as a means towards the accomplishment of the main object of the legislation. We are asked to read 'hire' as meaning the wages paid to an employee so as to make the statute merely forbid discrimination in one of the terms of men who have secured employment. So to read the statute would do violence to a spontaneous textual reading of  8(3) in that 'hire' would serve no function because, in the sense which is urged upon us, it is included in the prohibition against 'discrimination in regard to ... any term or condition of employment'. Contemporaneous legislative history,5 and, above all, the background of industrial experience forbid such textual mutilation.\n The natural construction which the text, the legislative setting and the function of the statute command, does not impose an obligation on the employer to favor union members in hiring employees. He is as free to hire as he is to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 187]\n\u00a0\n discharge employees. The statute does not touch 'the normal exercise of the right of the employer to select its employees or to discharge them'. It is directed solely against the abuse of that right by interfering with the countervailing right of self-organization.\n We have already recognized the power of Congress to deny an employer the freedom to discriminate in discharging. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352. So far as questions of constitutionality are concerned we need not enlarge on the statement of Judge Learned Hand in his opinion below (113 F.2d 207), that there is 'no greater limitation in denying him ( the employer) the power to discriminate in hiring, than in discharging'. The course of decisions in this Court since Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161\n, 28 S.Ct. 277, 13 Ann.Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S.Ct. 240, L.R.A.1915C, 960, have completely sapped those cases of their authority. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S.Ct. 278; Texa & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S.S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct 427; Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592; National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra.\n Second. Since the refusal to hire Curtis and Daugherty solely because of their affiliation with the Union was an unfair labor practice under  8( 3), the remedial authority of the Board under  10(c) became operative. Of course it could issue, as it did, an order 'to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice' in the future. Did Congress also empower the Board to order the employer to undo the wrong by offering the men discriminated against the opportunity for employment which should not have been denied them?\n Reinstatement is the conventional correction for discriminatory discharges. Experience having demonstrated that discrimination in hiring is twin to discrimination in firing, it would indeed be surprising if Congress gave a remedy for the one which it denied for the other. The powers of the Board as well as the restrictions upon \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 188]\n\u00a0\n it must be drawn from  10(c), which directs the Board 'to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)'. It could not be seriously denied that to require discrimination in hiring or firing to be 'neutralized', National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333, 348\n, 58 S.Ct. 904, 911, by requiring the discrimination to cease not abstractly but in the concrete victimizing instances, is an 'affirmative action' which 'will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)'. Therefore, if  10(c), had empowered the Board to 'take such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)', the right to restore to a man employment which was wrongfully denied him could hardly be doubted. Even without such a mandate from Congress this Court compelled reinstatement to enforce the legislative policy against discrimination represented by the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S.S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427.6 Attainment of a great national policy through expert administration in collaboration with limited judicial review must not be confined within narrow canons for equitable relief deemed suitable by chancellors in ordinary private controversies. Compare Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601. To differentiate between discrimination in denying employment and in terminating it, would be a differentiation not only without substance but in defiance of that against which the prohibition of discrimination is directed.\n But, we are told, this is precisely the differentiation Congress has made. It has done so, the argument runs, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 189]\n\u00a0\n by not directing the Board 'to take such affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of this Act', simpliciter, but, instead, by empowering the Board 'to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act'. To attribute such a function to the participial phrase introduced by 'including' is to shrivel a versatile principle to an illustrative application. We find no justification whatever for attributing to Congress such a casuistic withdrawal of the authority which, but for the illustration, it clearly has given the Board. The word 'including' does n t lend itself to such destructive significance. Helvering v. Morgan's, Inc., \n293 \nU.S. 121, 125\n, 55 S.Ct. 60, 61, note.\n Third. We agree with the court below that the record warrants the Board's finding that the strikers were denied reemployment because of their union activities. Having held that the Board can neutralize such discrimination in the case of men seeking new employment, the Board certainly had this power in regard to the strikers. And so we need not consider whether the order concerning the strikers should stand, as the court below held it should, even though that against Curtis and Daugherty would fall.\n Fourth. There remain for consideration the limitations upon the Board's power to undo the effects of discrimination. Specifically, we have the question of the Board's power to order employment in cases where the men discriminated against had obtained 'substantially equivalent employment'. The Board as a matter of fact found that no such employment had been obtained, but alternatively concluded that, in any event, the men should be offered employment. The court below, on the other hand, in harmony with three other circuits, Mooresville Cotton Mills v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 94 F.2d 61; National Labor Relations Board v. Botany Worsted Mills, 3 Cir., \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 190]\n\u00a0\n 106 F.2d 263; National Labor Relations Board v. Carlisle Lumber Co., 9 Cir ., 99 F.2d 533, ruled that employment need not be offered any worker who had obtained such employment, and since the record as to some of the strikers who had gone to work at the Shattuck Denn Company was indecisive on this issue, remanded the case to the Board for further findings. This aspect of the Board's authority depends on the relation of the general remedial powers conferred by  10(c) to the provisions of  2(3).\n The specific provisions of the Act out of which the proper conclusion is to be drawn should be before us. Section 10(c), as we already know, authorizes the Board 'to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)'. The relevant portions of Section 2(3) follows: 'The term 'employee' shall include any employee, and shall not be limited to the employees of a particular employer, unless the Act explicitly states otherwise, and shall include any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment'.\n Merely as a matter of textual reading these provisions in combination permit three possible constructions: (1) a curtailment of the powers of the Board of take affirmative action by reading into  10(c) the restrictive phrase of  2(3) regarding a worker 'who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment'; (2) a completely distributive reading of  10(c) and  2(3), whereby the factor of 'regular and substantially equivalent employment' in no way limits the Board's usual power to require employment to be offered a worker who has lost employment because of discrimination; (3) an avoidance of this either-or read- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 191]\n\u00a0\n ing of the statute by pursuing the central clue to the Board's powers- effectuation of the policies of the Act-and in that light appraising the relevance of a worker's having obtained 'substantially equivalent employment'.\n Denial of the Board's power to order opportunities of employment in this situation derives wholly from an infiltration of a portion of  2(3) into  10(c). The argument runs thus:  10(c) specifically refers to 'reinstatement of employees'; the latter portion of  2(3) refers to an 'employee' as a person 'who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment'; therefore, there can be no reinstatement of an employee who has obtained such employment. The syllogism is perfect. But this is a bit of verbal logic from which the mea ing of things has evaporated. In the first place, we have seen that the Board's power to order an opportunity for employment does not derive from the phrase 'including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay', and is not limited by it. Secondly, insofar as any argument is to be drawn from the reference to 'employees' in  10(c), it must be noted that the reference is to 'employees', unqualified and undifferentiated. To circumscribe the general class, 'employees', we must find authority either in the policy of the Act or in some specific delimiting provision of it.\n Not only is the Act devoid of a comprehensive definition of 'employee' restrictive of  10(c) but the contrary is the fact. The problem of what workers were to be covered by legal remedies for assuring the right of self-organization was a familiar one when Congress formulated the Act. The policy which it expressed in defining 'employee' both affirmatively and negatively, as it did in  2(3), had behind it important practical and judicial experience. 'The term 'employee',' the section reads, 'shall include any employee, and shall not \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 192]\n\u00a0\n be limited to the employees of a particular employer, unless the Act ( chapter) explicitly states otherwise ....' This was not fortuitous phrasing. It had reference to the controversies engendered by constructions placed upon the Clayton Act and kindred state legislation in relation to the functions of workers' organizations and the desire not to repeat those controversies. Cf. New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., \n303 \nU.S. 552\n, 58 S.Ct. 703. The broad definition of 'employee', 'unless the Act (chapter) explicitly states otherwise', as well as the definition of 'labor dispute' in  2(9), expressed the conviction of Congress 'that disputes may arise regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee, and that self-organization of employees may extend beyond a single plant or employer'. H.R. Rep. No. 1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 9; see, also, S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 6, 7.\n The reference in  2(3) to workers who have 'obtained regular and substantially equivalent employment' has a role consonant with some purposes of the Act but not one destructive of the broad definition of 'employee' with which  2(3) begins. In determining whether an employer has refused to bargain collectively with the representatives of 'his employees' in violation of  8(5) and  9(a) it is of course essential to determine who constitute 'his employees'. One aspect of this is covered by  9(b) which provides for determination of the appropriate bargaining unit. And once the unit is selected, the reference in  2(3) to workers who have obtained equivalent employment comes into operation in determining who shall be treated as employees within the unit.\n To deny the Board power to neutralize discrimination merely because workers have obtained compensatory employment would confine the 'policies of this Act' to the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 193]\n\u00a0\n correction of private injuries. The Board was not devised for such a limited function. It is the agency of Congress for translating into concreteness the purpose of safeguarding and encouraging the right of self- organization. The Board, we have held very recently, does not exist for the 'adjudication of private rights'; it 'acts in a public capacity to give effect to the declared public policy of the Act to eliminate and prevent obstructions to interstate commerce by encouraging collective bargaining'. National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 60 S.Ct. 569, 576; and see Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., \n309 \nU.S. 261\n, 60 S.Ct. 561. To be sure, reinstatement is not needed to repair the economic loss of a worker who, after discrimination, has obtained an equally profitable job. But to limit the significance of discrimination merely to questions of monetary loss to workers would thwart the central purpos of the Act, directed as that is toward the achievement and maintenance of workers' self-organization. That there are factors other than loss of wages to a particular worker to be considered is suggested even by a meager knowledge of industrial affairs. Thus, to give only one illustration, if men were discharged who were leading efforts at organization in a plant having a low wage scale, they would not unnaturally be compelled by their economic circumstances to seek and obtain employment elsewhere at equivalent wages. In such a situation, to deny the Board power to wipe out the prior discrimination by ordering the employment of such workers would sanction a most effective way of defeating the right of self-organization.\n Therefore, the mere fact that the victim of discrimination has obtained equivalent employment does not itself preclude the Board from undoing the discrimination and requiring employment. But neither does this remedy automatically flow from the Act itself when discrim- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 194]\n\u00a0\n ination has been found. A statute expressive of such large public policy as that on which the National Labor Relations Board is based must be broadly phrased and necessarily carries with it the task of administrative application. There is an area plainly covered by the language of the Act and an area no less plainly without it. But in the nature of things Congress could not catalogue all the devices and stratagems for circumventing the policies of the Act. Nor could it define the whole gamut of remedies to effectuate these policies in an infinite variety of specific situations. Congress met these difficulties by leaving the adaptation of means to end to the empiric process of administration. The exercise of the process was committed to the Board, subject to limited judicial review. Because the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence, courts must not enter the allowable area of the Board's discretion and must guard against the danger of sliding unconsciously from the narrow confines of law into the more spacious domain of policy. On the other hand, the power with which Congress invested the Board implies responsibility-the responsibility of exercising its judgment in employing the statutory powers.\n The Act does not create rights for individuals which must be vindicated according to a rigid scheme of remedies. It entrusts to an expert agency the maintenance and promotion of industrial peace. According to the experience revealed by the Board's decisions, the effectuation of this important policy generally requires not only compensation for the loss of wages but also offers of employment to the victims of discrimination. Only thus can there be a restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination. But even where a worker has not secured equivalent employment, the Board, under particular circumstances, may refuse to order his employment \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 195]\n\u00a0\n because it would not effectuate the policies of the Act. It has, for example, declined to do so in the case of a worker who had been discharged for union activities and had sought re-employment after having offered his services as a labor spy. Matter of Thompson Cabinet Company, 11 N.L.R.B. 1106, 1116, 1117\n\n\n From the beginning the Board has recognized that a worker who has obtained equivalent employment is in a different position from one who has lost his job as well as his wages through an employer's unfair labor practice. In early decisions, the Board did not order reinstatement of workers who had secured such equivalent employment. See Matter of Rabhor Company, Inc., 1 N.L.R.B. 470, 481; Matter of Jeffery-De Witt Insulator Company, 1 N.L.R.B. 618, 628. It apparently focussed on the absence of loss of wages in determining the applicable remedy. But other factors may well enter into the appropriateness of ordering the offending employer to offer employment to one illegally denied it. Reinstatement may be the effective assuranc of the right of self-organization. Again, without such a remedy industrial peace might be endangered because workers would be resentful of their inability to return to jobs to which they may have been attached and from which they were wrongfully discharged. On the other hand, it may be, as was urged on behalf of the Board in Mooresville Cotton Mills v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 97 F.2d 959, 963, that, in making such an order for reinstatement the necessity for making room for the old employees by discharging new ones, as well as questions affecting the dislocation of the business, ought to be considered. All these and other factors outside our domain of experience may come into play. Their relevance is for the Board, not for us. In the exercise of its informed discretion the Board may find that effectuation of the Act's policies may or may not require reinstatement. We have no warrant for speculating on matters of fact the determination of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 196]\n\u00a0\n which Congress has entrusted to the Board. All we are entitled to ask is that the statute speak through the Board where the statute does not speak for itself.\n The only light we have on the Board's decision in this case is its statement that, if any of the workers discriminated against had obtained substantially equivalent employment, they should be offered employment 'for the reasons set forth in' Matter of Eagle-Picher Mining & Smelting Co ., 16 N.L.R.B. 727, 833. But in that case the Board merely concluded that  2(3) did not deny it the power to order reinstatement; it did not consider the appropriateness of its exercise. Thus the Board determined only the dry legal question of its power, which we sustain; it did not consider whether in employing that power the policies of the Act would be enforced. The court below found, and the Board has not challenged the finding, that the Board left the issue of equivalence of jobs at the Shattuck Denn Company in doubt, and remanded the order to the Board for further findings. Of course, if the Board finds that equivalent employment has not been obtained, it is within its province to require offers of re-employment in accordance with its general conclusion that a worker's loss in wages and in general working conditions must be made whole. Even if it should find that equivalent jobs were secured by the men who suffered from discrimination, it may order employment at Phelps Dodge if it finds that to do so would effectuate the policies of the Act. We believe that the procedure we have indicated will likewise effectuate the policies of the Act by making workable the system of restricted judicial review in relation to the wide discretionary authority which Congress has given the Board.\n From the record of the present case we cannot really tell why the Board has ordered reinstatement of the strikers who obtained subsequent employment. The Board first found that the men had not obtained sub- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 197]\n\u00a0\n stantially equivalent employment within the meaning of  2(3); later it concluded that even if they had obtained such employment it would order their reinstatement. It did so, however, as we have noted, merely because it asserted its legal power so to do. When the court below held that proof did not support the Board's finding concerning equivalence of employment at Shattuck Denn and remanded the case to the Board for additional evidence on that issue, the Board took this issue out of the case by expressly declining to ask for its review here.\n The administrative process will best be vindicated by clarity in its exercise. Since Congress has defined the authority of the Board and the procedure by which it must be asserted and has charged the federal courts with the duty of reviewing the Board's orders ( 10(e) and (f), it will avoid needless litigation and make for effective and expeditious enforcement of the Board's order to require the Board to disclose the basis of its order. We do not intend to enter the province that belongs to the Board, nor do we do so. All we ask of t e Board is to give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it. This is to affirm most emphatically the authority of the Board.\n Fifth. As part of its remedial action against the unfair labor practices, the Board ordered that workers who had been denied employment be made whole for their loss of pay. In specific terms, the Board ordered payment to the men of a sum equal to what they normally would have earned from the date of the discrimination to the time of employment less their earnings during this period. The court below added a further deduction of amounts which the workers 'failed without excuse to earn', and the Board here challenges this modification.\n Making the workers whole for losses suffered on account of an unfair labor practice is part of the vindication of the public policy which the Board enforces. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 198]\n\u00a0\n Since only actual losses should be made good, it seems fair that deductions should be made not only for actual earnings by the worker but also for losses which he willfully incurred. To this the Board counters that to apply this abstractly just doctrine of mitigation of damages to the situations before it, often involving substantial numbers of workmen, would put on the Board details too burdensome for effective administration. Simplicity of administration is thus the justification for deducting only actual earnings and for avoiding the domain of controversy as to wages that might have been earned.\n But the advantages of a simple rule must be balanced against the importance of taking fair account, in a civilized legal system, of every socially desirable factor in the final judgment. The Board, we believe, overestimates administrative difficulties and underestimates its administrative resourcefulness. Here again we must avoid the rigidities of an either-or-rule. The remedy of back pay, it must be remembered, is entrusted to the Board's discretion; it is not mechanically compelled by the Act. And in applying its authority over back pay orders, the Board has not used stereotyped formulas but has availed itself of the freedom given it by Congress to attain just results in diverse, complicated situations. \n7\n See (1939) 48 Yale L.J. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 199]\n\u00a0\n 1265. The Board has a wide discretion to keep the present matter within reasonable bounds through flexible procedural devices. The Board will thus have it within its power to avoid delays and difficulties incident to passing on remote and speculative claims by employers, while at the same time it may give appropriate weight to a clearly \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 200]\n\u00a0\n unjustifiable refusal to take desirable new employment. By leaving such an adjustment to the administrative process we have in mind not so much the minimization of damages as the healthy policy of promoting production and employment. This consideration in no way weakens the enforcement of the policies of the Act by exerting coercion against men who have been unfairly denied employment to take employment elsewhere and later, because of their new employment, declaring them barred from returning to the jobs of their choice. This is so because we hold that the power of ordering offers of employment rests with the Board even as to workers who have obtained equivalent employment.\n But though the employer should be allowed to go to proof on this issue, the Board's order should not have been modified by the court below. The matter should have been left to the Board for determination by it prior to formulating its order and should not be left for possible final settlement in contempt proceedings.\n Sixth. Other minor objections to the Board's order were found without substance below. After careful consideration we agree with this disposition of these questions, and do not feel that further discussion is required.\n The decree below should be modified in accordance with this opinion, remanding to the Board the two matters discussed under Fourth and Fifth herein, for the Board's determination of these issues. So ordered.\n Remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or disposition of the case.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY (dissenting in part).\n While I fully approve the disposition of the first three issues in the opinion just announced, I cannot assent to the modification of that part of the Board's order \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 201]\n\u00a0\n which required reinstatement of certain employees, or to the limitation imposed on the Board's power to make back pay awards.\n First. The Board is now directed to reconsider its order of reinstatement merely because, in the course of its recital, it stated that even if the employees in question had secured other substantially equivalent employment it would nevertheless order their reinstatement for the reasons set forth in Matter of Eagle-Picher Mining & Smelting Co., 16 N.L.R.B. 727.1 There is neither claim nor evidence that reinstatement will not effectuate the policies of the Act. There is no suggestion that the order the Board issued was wrong or beyond its power. That order is challenged only because the statement and reference to the Eagle-Picher case are said to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 202]\n\u00a0\n demonstrate that t e Board ordered reinstatement mechanically due to a misconception of its functions under the statute, and that it did not consider whether reinstatement would effectuate the policies of the Act.\n Even if it be assumed that this recital imports an inaccurate appraisal of the Board's power, an assumption which I believe is without justification, modification of its order is not a necessary consequence. The question before us is whether the order the Board issued was within its power. There is no occasion now to determine what disposition should be made of an order which was not an exercise of the Board's administrative discretion, or to infer that the Board must investigate the substantial equivalency of other employment before it may order reinstatement. Suffice to say, the Board found that certain employees had been the objects of unfair labor practices and that it would effectuate the policies of the Act to order their reinstatement. It expressly rested its order upon those findings.\n The circumstances occasioning the latter finding are convincing evidence that the Board not only was required to but did exercise discretion in the formulation of its order of reinstatement. Throughout the hearing the employer's counsel sought to show by cross examining them that the complaining employees were not entitled to reinstatement. Shortly after that examination commenced, the trial examiner requested the Board's attorney to state the theory upon which he contended that those employees should be reinstated. Considerable testimony was offered to show the working conditions, hours, rates of pay, continuity of operation, etc., of mines in which the witnesses had secured other employment.\n All this was in the record certified to the Board. Accompanying it was the contention of the employer that reinstatement should be denied for various reasons. The \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 203]\n\u00a0\n Board explicitly considered the contention, among others, that reinstatement would provoke further disputes and discord among the employees rather than promote labor peace. It also considered the contention that many of the employees had obtained other substantially equivalent employment, making both general and specific findings concerning it. \n2\n Finally, it concluded that the policies of the Act would be effectuated by ordering the employer to tender reinstatement to designated employees.\n That its order of reinstatement was more than a perfunctory exercise of power is pointedly manifest from the Board's own statements. Answering the employer's contention that reinstatement might foster discord among the employees, the Board declared: 'We cannot but consider the difficulties of adjustment envisaged in the foregoing testimony (upon which the employer relied) as conjectural and insubstantial, especially in view of the lapse of time since the strike. However, even assuming that the asserted resentment of non-strikers towards strikers and picketers persists, the effectuation of the policies of the Act patently requires3 the restoration of the strikers and picketers to their status quo before the discrimination against them.'\n In discussing its proposed order, the Board said: 'Having found that the respondent has engaged in unfair labor practices, we will order it to cease and desist therefrom and to take certain affirmative action designed to effectuate the policies of the Act4 and to restore as nearly \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 204]\n\u00a0\n as possible the condition which existed prior to the commission of the unfair labor practices.'\n And in its formal order, the Board stated: 'Upon the basis of the above findings of fact and conclusions of law, and pursuant to Section 10( c) of the National Labor Relations Act, the National Labor Relations Board hereby orders that the respondent, Phelps Dodge Corporation ... shall : ... 2. Take the following affirmative action which the Board finds will effectuate the policies of the Act:5 (a) Offer to the following persons immediate and full reinstatement to their former or substantially equivalent positions ...; (b) Make whole (the following employees) for any loss of pay they may have suffered by reason of the respondent's discriminatory refusal to reinstate them ... less the net earnings of each ....'\n The italicized phrases in these quotations were not chance or formal recitals. They expressed in summary a considered exercise of administrative discretion. The Board carefully followed the precise procedure which this Court says it should have adopted. It found that the employees in question had been the victims of unfair labor practices. It also found that the policies of the Act would be effectuated by ordering their reinstatement. Since there was evidence to support these findings, it is difficult to understand what more the Board should or could have done.\n But if we are now to consider in the abstract whether the Board properly opined that it might have the power to order reinstatement without regard to the substantial equivalency of other employment, I am nevertheless unable to approve the modification of its order, or to accept the inference that the Board must consider the substantial equivalency of other employment before it may order reinstatement. There is nothing in  10(c) or in the Act \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 205]\n\u00a0\n as a whole which expressly or impliedly obligates the Board to consider the substantial equivalency of other employment or to make findings concerning it before it may order reinstatement. Indeed, such a rule narrows rather than broadens the administrative discretion which the Act confers on the Board.\n Practical administrative experience may convince the Board that the self-interest of the employee is a far better gauge of the substantial equivalency of his other employment than any extended factual inquiry of its own. Conversely, the Board may conclude that the policies of the Act are best effectuated by an investigation in every case into the nature of his other employment. That choice of rules is an exercise of discretion which Congress has entrusted to the Board. Whichever rule the Board adopts, it does not follow that reinstatement becomes a remedy which is granted automatically u on a finding of unfair labor practices. If for other reasons the Board finds that the policies of the Act will not be effectuated, of course it not only could but should decline to order an offer of reinstatement. Compare Matter of Thompson Cabinet Co., 11 N.L.R.B. 1106.\n Second. As already indicated, I am unable to accept the limitation now imposed on the Board's power to make back pay awards. Again the question is simply this: Was the back pay order within the power of the Board and supported by evidence? What order the Board should have made or what rule of law it should have followed if some of the employees had 'willfully incurred' losses are questions of importance which we should answer only when they are presented. They are not here now.\n The Board expressly found that the policies of the Act would be effectuated by ordering the employer to make whole those employees who had been the victims of discriminatory practices. We are pointed to nothing which requires a different conclusion. We are not referred to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 206]\n\u00a0\n any employee who 'willfully incurred' losses, or to any evidence in the record compelling us to hold that any of them did. At most the record shows only that some of the employees obtained other employment-which was not substantially equivalent-and then voluntarily relinquished it. For all we know, the Board could have determined that this evidence did not establish 'willfully incurred' losses. Plainly that was a permissible inference from the evidence, and this being so, there is no occasion now to decide what the Board should have done had it drawn some other inference.\n But again, if we are now to rule on the abstract issue, I cannot agree that the power to make back pay awards must be fettered in the manner described in the opinion just announced. For if the Board has no choice but to accept the limitation now imposed, its administrative discretion is curbed by the very decision which purports to leave it untouched.\n It must be conceded that nothing in the Act requires such a limitation in so many words. To be sure nothing in the Act requires a back pay award to be diminished by the amounts actually earned (compare Republic Steel Corp. v. N.L.R.B., \n311 \nU.S. 7\n, 61 S.Ct. 77), but that should admonish us to hesitate before we introduce yet another modification which Congress has not seen fit to enact, especially when the two situations differ in many respects. It is not our function to read the Act as we think it should have been written, or to supplant a rule adopted by the Board with one which we believe is better. Our only office is to determine whether the rule chosen, tested in the light of statutory standards, was within the permissible range of the Board's discretion.\n The Board might properly conclude that the policies of the Act would best be effectuated by refusing to embark on the inquiry whether the employees had willfully incurred losses. Administrative difficulties engendered \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 207]\n\u00a0\n by a contrary rule would be infinite, particularly as the number of individuals involved in the dispute increased. Underlying the contrary rule is the supposition that the employee would purposely remain idle awaiting his back pay award. But that attributes to the employee an omniscience frequently not given to members of the legal profession. He must be able to determine that the employer actually has committed unfair labor practices; that the unfair labor practices affect commerce within the meaning of  2(6) and 2(7); that the Board will take favorable action and make a back pay award; that the Circuit Court of Appeals will enforce that order in full; and that this Court finally will affirm if the case comes here.\n This is not all. He must have capital sufficient to provide for himself and for any dependents while he awaits the back pay award, even though that may not come until several years later. \n6\n He must risk union disfavor by dividing his efforts between a labor dispute and a search for a new job. He must realize, alth ugh his natural suppositions are otherwise, that he will probably not endanger seniority rights or chance of reinstatement by accepting other employment. He must be able to decide when he has made sufficient efforts to secure other employment notwithstanding that he is not told whether he can or must accept any job no matter where it is or what type of employment, wages, hours, or working conditions.\n At his peril he must determine all these things because conventional common law concepts and doctrines of damages, applicable in suits to enforce purely private rights, are to be imported into the National Labor Relations Act. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 208]\n\u00a0\n Having these considerations in mind, supplemented perhaps by others not available or suggested to us, the Board might well decide that the rule disapproved here would best effectuate the policies of the Act. I do not think we should substitute our judgment on this issue for that of the Board.\n Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the Board in full.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting in part).\n With two rulings of the Court's opinion the CHIEF JUSTICE and I are unable to agree.\n Congress has, we think, by the terms of the Act, excluded from the Board's power to reinstate wrongfully discharged employees, any authority to reinstate those who have 'obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment'. And we are not persuaded that Congress, by granting to the Board, by  10(c) of the Act, authority 'to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)', has also authorized it to order the employer to hire applicants for work who have never been in his employ or to compel him to give them 'back pay' for any period whatever.\n The authority of the Board to take affirmative action by way of reinstatement of employees is not to be read as conferring upon it power to take any measures, however drastic, which it conceives will effectuate the policies of the Act. We have held that the provision is remedial not punitive, Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197, 235\n, 236 S., 59 S.Ct. 206, 219; see, also, National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261, 267\n, 268 S., 58 S.Ct. 571, 574, 575, 115 A.L.R. 307, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 209]\n\u00a0\n and that its purpose is to effectuate the policies of the Act by achieving the 'remedial objectives which the Act sets forth' and 'to restore and make whole employees who have been discharged in violation of the Act.' Republic Steel Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 7, 12\n, 61 S.Ct. 77, 79, 80. The Act itself has emphasized this purpose when, in including in the category of 'employees' those who might not otherwise have been so included, it provided,  2(3), that the term 'employee' 'shall include any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment'.\n While the stated policy of a statute is an important factor in interpreting its command, we cannot ignore the words of the command in ascertaining its policy. In enlarging the category of 'employees' to include wrongfully discharged employees and at the same time excluding from it those who have obtained 'other regular and substantially equivalent employment', the Congress adopted a policy which it may well have thought would further the cause of industrial peace quite as much as the enforced employment of discharged employees where there was no occasion to compensate them for the loss of their employment. It is the policy of the Act and not the Board's policy which is to be effectuated, and in the face of so explicit a restriction of the d finition of discharged employees to those who have not procured equivalent employment, we can only conclude that Congress has adopted the policy of restricting the authorized 'reinstatement of employees' to that class.\n Even if we read the language of  2(3) distributively, it seems difficult to say that the specially granted power to reinstate employees, extends to those who, by definition, are not employees, and this is the more so when the effect of the definition is consonant with what appears \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 210]\n\u00a0\n to be the declared purpose of the reinstatement provision. Nor can it fairly be said that the definition of employees is of significance only for the purpose of determining the appropriate bargaining agency of the employees. There is no evidence in the statute itself or to be derived from its legislative history that the definition was not to be applied in the one case quite as much as in the other. Certainly the fact of substantially equivalent employment has as much bearing upon making the discharged employee whole as upon his right to participate in the choice of a bargaining representative, and no ground has been advanced for saying that it applies to one and not the other.\n As a majority of the Court is of opinion that the Board does possess the power to order reinstatement even though the discharged employees had obtained other equivalent employment, we agree that the case should now be remanded to the Board for a determination of the question whether reinstatement here would further the policies of the Act.\n We agree that petitioner's refusal to hire two applicants for jobs, because of their union membership, was an unfair labor practice within the meaning of  8(3) of the Act, even though they had never been employees of the petitioner, and that under  9(c) the Board was authorized to order petitioner to cease and desist from the practice and to take appropriate proceedings under  10 to enforce its order. But it is quite another matter to say that Congress has also authorized the Board to order the employer to hire applicants for work who have never been in his employ and to compel him to give them 'back pay.'\n The Congressional debates and committee reports give no hint that in enacting the National Labor Relations Act Congress or any member of it thought it was giving the Board a remedial power which few courts had ever \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 211]\n\u00a0\n assumed to exercise or had been thought to possess and we are unable to say that the words of the statute go so far. The authority given to the Board by  10(c) is, as we have said, not an unrestricted power, and the grant is not to be read as though the words 'including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay' were no part of the statute. None of the words of a statute are to be disregarded and it cannot be assumed that the introduction of the phrase in this one was without a purpose.\n Undoubtedly the word 'including' may preface an illustrative example of a general power already granted, Helvering v. Morgan's, Inc., \n293 \nU.S. 121, 125\n, 55 S.Ct. 60, 61, or it may serve to define that power or even enlarge it. Cf. Montello Salt Co. v. Utah, \n221 \nU.S. 452, 462\n, 31 S.Ct. 706, 707, Ann.Cas.1912D, 633, et seq. Whether it is the one or another must be determined by the purpose of the Act, to be ascertained in the light of the context, the legislative history, and the subject matter to which the statute is to be applied.\n In view of the traditional reluctance of courts to compel the performance of personal service contracts it seems at least doubtful whether an authority to the Board to take affirmative action could, without more, fairly be construed as permitting it to take a kind of affirmative action which had very generally been thought to be beyond the power of courts. This is the more so because the Board's orders were by  10(c) made subject to review and modification of the courts without any specified restriction upon the exercise of that authority.\n It is true that in Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, this Court had held that upon contempt proceedings for violation of a decree enjoining coercive measures by the employer against his union employees, a court could properly direct that the contempt be purged on condition that the employer restore the status quo. But Congress in enacting the National \n\n[313 \nU.S. 177, 212]\n\u00a0\n Labor Relations Act took a step further by providing that the Board could order reinstatement of employees even though there had been no violation of any previous order of the Board or of a court. It thus removed the doubt which would otherwise have arisen by defining and, as we think, enlarging the Board's authority to take affirmative action so as to include the power to order 'reinstatement' of employees. But an authority to order reinstatement is not an authority to compel the employer to instate as his employees those whom he has never employed, and an authority to award 'back pay' to reinstated employees, is not an authority to compel payment of wages to applicants for employment whom the employer was never bound to hire.\n Authority for so unprecedented an exercise of power is not lightly to be inferred. In view of the use of the phrase 'including reinstatement of employees', as a definition and enlargement, as we think it is, of the authority of the Board to take affirmative action, we cannot infer from it a Congressional purpose to authorize the Board to order compulsory employment and wage payments not embraced in its terms. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States Industrial Commission, Final Report (1902) p. 892; Anthracite Coal Strike Commission, Report to the President on the Coal Strike of May-October, 1902, S.

Surely, a court of equity has no greater inherent authority in this regard than was conveyed to the Board by the broad grant of all such remedial powers as will, from case to case, translate into actuality the policies of the Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In accordance with the Board's general practice, deductions were made in the present case for amounts earned during the period of the back pay award. But the deductions have been limited to earnings during the hours when the worker would have been employed by the employer in question. Matter of Pusey, Maynes & Breish Co., 1 N.L.R.B. 482; Matter of National Motor Bearing Co., 5 N.L.R.B. 409. And only 'net earnings' are deducted, allowance being made for the expense of getting new employment which, but for the discrimination, would not have been necessary. Matter of Crossett Lumber Co., 8 N.L.R.B. 440.\n Even though a strike is caused by an unfair labor practice the Board does not award back pay during the period of the strike. Matte of Sunshine Hosiery Mills, 1 N.L.R.B. 664. Employees who are discriminatorily discharged are treated as strikers if during a strike they refuse an unconditional offer of reinstatement. Matter of Harter Corp., 8 N.L.R.B. 391. Originally back pay was ordered from the date of application for reinstatement, Matter of Sunshine Hosiery Mills, supra, but later orders have started back pay five days after application. Matter of Tiny Town Togs, 7 N.L.R.B. 54. \n If there is unjustified delay in filing charges before the Board, a deduction is made for the period of the delay. Matter of Inland Lime & Stone Co., 8 N.L.R.B. 944. Similar action is taken when a case is reopened after having been closed or withdrawn. Matter of C.G. Conn, Ltd., 10 N.L.R. B. 498. And if the trial examiner rules in favor of the employer and the Board reverses the ruling, no back pay is ordered for the period when the examiner's ruling stood unreversed. Matter of E.R. Haffelfinger Company, 1 N.L.R.B. 760; and see the order in the present case.\n The Board has refused to order any back pay where discriminatory discharges were made with honest belief that they were required by an invalid closed-shop contract. Matter of McKesson & Robbins, Inc., 19 N.L.R. B. p. 778.\n If the business conditions would have caused the plant to be closed or personnel to be reduced, back pay is awarded only for the period which the worker would have worked in the absence of discrimination. Matter of Ray Nichols, Inc., 15 N.L.R.B. 846. At times fluctuations in personnel so complicate the situation that a formula has to be devised for the distribution of a lump sum among the workers who have been discriminated against. Matter of Eagle-Picher Mining & Smelting Co., 16 N.L.R.B. 727.\n The rate of pay used in computing awards is generally that at the time of discrimination, but adjustments may be made for subsequent changes. Matter of Lone Star Bag & Bagging Co., 8 N.L.R.B. 244; cf. Matter of Acme Air Appliance Co., 10 N.L.R.B. 1385. Normal earnings in tips or bonuses have been taken into account. Matter of Club Troika, 2 N.L.R.B. 90; Matter of Central Truck Lines, 3 N.L.R.B. 317. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The entire paragraph in which this statement appears reads: 'We have found that the respondent has discriminated in regard to hire and tenure of employment of certain individuals named above. In accordance with our usual practice we shall order the reinstatement or the reemployment of such individuals. The respondent contends that the Board lacks power to order the reinstatement of any striker who has obtained other regular and substantially equivalent employment. We have found that none of the strikers discriminated against has obtained other regular and substantially equivalent employment within the meaning of the Act. Nevertheless, even if any striker had obtained such employment, we would, for the reasons set forth in Matter of Eagle-Picher Mining & Smelting Co., still order reinstatement by the respondent.'\n It is to be noted, of course, that in the Eagle-Picher case the Board's remarks were made in answer to the argument advanced here, that  2(3) narrows the application of the term 'employees' in  10(c).\n It is worth noting, too, that in that case the Board stated: 'Further to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Act, and as a means of removing and avoiding the consequences of the respondents' unfair labor practices, we shall, in aid of our cease and desist order, order the respondents to take certain affirmative action, more particularly described below.' 16 N.L.R.B. 727, 831. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Board found that none of the employees had obtained other substantially equivalent employment. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this finding in part. The reversal is not challenged here, but that is immaterial since the Court now decides that the Board has the power to order reinstatement even though the employees have found other substantially equivalent employment, provided that the policies of the Act will be effectuated. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Emphasis added. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Emphasis added. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Emphasis added. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The labor dispute which gave rise to this proceeding occurred in 1935. \n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPHILADELPHIA CO. v. DIPPLE(1941)\nNo. 242\nArgued: Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n As Amended Feb. 10, 1941. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. A. Seifert and Lee C. Beatty, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Miss Anne X. Alpern and Mr. A. E. Kountz, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a problem similar to that involved in No. 120. Here the debtor instituted a reorganization proceeding under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207 (now chapter X of that Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  501 et seq.) 1 and the question presented is whether the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n trustees should be directed to pay taxes owed by corporations whose properties the debtor operated under leases and operating agreements and the trustees continued to operate. Although the courts below did not refer to the Act of June 18, 1934,2 the petitioners' insistence that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is in the teeth of the provisions of the Act and conflicts with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in Palmer v. Webster and Atlas National Bank, No. 120, \n312 \nU.S. 156\n, 61 S.Ct. 542, 85 L.Ed. --, caused us to grant certiorari. \n311 \nU.S. 628\n, 61 S.Ct. 33, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The debtor, Pittsburgh Railways Company, has, for many years, possessed and used the properties of some fifty-five street railway companies and has operated those properties, in connection with its own, as a unified street railway system in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and surrounding territory. The debtor obtained possession of the properties of the underlying companies through leases and operating agreements which required the debtor to pay all expenses of operation and maintenance and all the taxes of the underlying companies. The system comprises some 560 miles of track, incline plane railways, cars, car barns, and buildings. The debtor owns 28 miles of the track and owns cars and other property. Pursuant to the terms of the leases and agreements, the debtor has directly paid the expenses of operating, maintenance charges, and all taxes of the underlying companies. After the filing of the debtor's petition under  77B, its approval, and an order continuing the debtor in possession, the court, June 14, 1938, appointed trustees with authority to maintain, manage, and operate the property in possession of, or owned by, the debtor; to manage and conduct its business; collect the revenues therefrom, and to pay all taxes and assessments due, or to become due, upon property in possession of, or owned by, the debtor. The trustees have since been operating \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 171]\n\u00a0\n the business, using therein the properties of the underlying companies. They have not affirmed or disaffirmed the leases and operating agreements.\n March 10, 1939, the trustees petitioned the District Court for instructions respecting the payment, as administration expenses, of taxes assessed against the debtor, a subsidiary, and the underlying companies. \n3\n The petition was referred to a master before whom objections were filed by the City of Pittsburgh, a creditor, and also by a creditors' committee, to the payment of the taxes assessed against the underlying companies. These consisted of Pennsylvania corporate stock taxes, Pennsylvania corporate net income taxes, Pennsylvania corporate loan taxes, and Federal income taxes, some of which accrued and became payable subsequent to the filing of the petition for reorganization and some of which accrued prior thereto. The present petitioners appeared before the master and advocated an order for payment of the taxes.\n It appeared from the trustees' petition that they had on hand an amount sufficient to pay all the taxes as to which they requested instruction and that none of the underlying companies had funds with which to pay any of the taxes assessed against them. The testimony before the master showed that during the existence of the unified system no attempt was made to account for the revenues and operating expenses of individual underlying companies; that any attempt to account for the revenues and expenses of individual companies would be very expensive and the results would not be sufficiently accurate to form a basis for allocating the items; that it was impossible to operate each underlying company separately so as to ascertain the net earnings of each, and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n that it was probably impossible to determine what would be the fair proportion of rentals to be paid to the various underlying companies whose properties were utilized by the debtor and are now utilized by the trustees. There was testimony that it was impracticable at the time of the hearing for the trustees to state what properties of underlying companies would be embraced in the contemplated plan of reorganization.\n In his report, the master recommended that the trustees be directed not to pay taxes assessed against the underlying companies at the present time. This recommendation was supported by a finding that it was uncertain that any of the leases would be affirmed by the trustees and that, in the absence of evidence that the net earnings of each underlying company equalled its taxes, payment of taxes might result in preferment or overpayment. Furthermore, the master found that claims of the debtor against certain of the underlying companies might extinguish any existing equities in the properties of the latter.\n After a hearing on exceptions to the master's report, and after receiving a recommendation from the trustees as to what taxes of the underlying companies should be paid, the District Court entered an order that the bulk of the taxes of the underlying companies should be paid by the trustees. The decree was predicated upon the fact that the system had been operated as a unit for many years; that all income derived from the lines of the underlying companies had been kept in one fund, and that it was equitable that the taxes of the underlying companies be treated as taxes of the debtor.\n Upon an appeal by the creditors' committee and by the City of Pittsburgh, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order of the District Court so far as it applied to the taxes of the underlying companies. \n4\n That court held \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 173]\n\u00a0\n that the debtor's undertaking to pay the taxes of the underlying companies was merely a portion of the consideration for the use of their property and was, therefore, a rental obligation and not a tax liability. The argument was pressed upon the court that the separate corporate entities of the underlying companies should be disregarded. In view of the fact that none of the underlying companies had filed petitions for reorganization, and thus subjected themselves to the jurisdiction of the court, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that, until affirmation of the leases and operating agreements by the trustees, their sole obligation was to pay a reasonable amount for use and occupation which could not be in excess of the net earnings derived from the operation of each property and could not be ascertained until it was determined what property was being used, the extent of the use, and the net earnings derived from it or its value.\n The petitioners challenge the decision on the ground that it is contrary to the terms of the Act of June 18, 1934,5 which directs that a trustee appointed by a court of the United States who is authorized to conduct any business, or does so, shall be subject to all state and local taxes applicable to the business; and on the further ground that it is violative of accepted principles of equitable administration of estates in receivership or reorganization.\n The situation here differs from that disclosed in No. 120 in that  77B contains no provision requiring the debtor to continue to operate the business of a lessor upon rejection of the lease. It further differs in that, here, the trustees have neither affirmed nor disaffirmed the leases and operating agreements. Another difference is that, in the present instance, none of the lessors or underlying companies is in reorganization. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 174]\n\u00a0\n Notwithstanding the fact that  77B gives no specific authority to trustees in reorganization to reject burdensome leases or contracts, it is well settled that they have that right and are accorded a reasonable time within which to exercise it. If, in the opinion of the officers of the underlying companies, a reasonable time has expired those companies are not without redress. They may declare a forfeiture of the leases and abrogate the agreements for nonperformance on the part of the trustees or, they may apply to the District Court to compel an election by the trustees, to affirm or disaffirm. In the meantime, if the situation were such as to permit a proper calculation of the amount due for use and occupation, it would be proper for the court to order the trustees to pay a reasonable sum to be treated as a payment for use and occupation in the event that the leases and agreements are disaffirmed or, on account of rent, in the event they are affirmed. But this record furnishes no basis for such a calculation. The master has found, and the finding is not challenged, that there is no data available from which it can be determined what is the value of the various underlying properties or what is the fair value of their use. It is evident that the debtor has welded these underlying properties into one system in such fashion that a single route or a single passenger ride may involve the use of a number of the underlying companies' properties. Ascertainment of a proper apportionment of the receipts of the system as a whole to the respective contributions of the underlying companies' properties is obviously almost an impossible task. Moreover, since the underlying companies are simple contract creditors, an overpayment to any one of them might work a preference as against other such creditors, including the City of Pittsburgh and the tort claimants who are respondents here. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 175]\n\u00a0\n In the light of these facts, it becomes evident that the Act of 1934 has no application. The trustees are operating the business of the Pittsburgh Railways Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania. The District Court has ordered them to pay the taxes due by that corporation and by its wholly owned subsidiary, a bus company. In that aspect the order is not attacked. But the trustees are not operating the business of the various underlying companies. It may well be that the only business those companies have is to collect or enforce payment of the rentals and considerations due them under the respective leases and operating agreements. But, even so, that business is not the business of the Pittsburgh Railways Company and the trustees are not trustees of any such business.\n What has been said in No. 120 need not be amplified in this case. It is plain that the Act of 1934 is inapplicable.\n The petitioners recognize that the authorities cited by them in which courts having charge of receiverships or of reorganization proceedings under  77B have ordered the payment of taxes by a receiver or by trustees dealt only with the taxes of the corporation represented by the receiver, or for whose business the trustees were appointed. They contend, however, that the same principle ought to apply here because the system operated by the Pittsburgh Railways Company is a unified system. They urge that the business is a single business. They show that for thirty-six years prior to the filing of the petition the identity of the lines of the underlying companies has been obliterated by the creation of a unified system of railway transportation and they say that the whole business should be treated as that of the Pittsburgh Railways Company now conducted by its trustees in reorganization. But, as we have said, the underlying companies' relation to the Pittsburgh Railways Company \n\n[312 \nU.S. 168, 176]\n\u00a0\n is that of creditor and debtor and no principle of equity justifies ignoring that relation when, so to do, might adversely affect the claims of other creditors.\n For these reasons we hold the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right and should be affirmed. So ordered.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  77B was adopted June 7, 1934, 48 Stat. 912, and was amended Aug. 29, 1935, 49 Stat. 965, and Aug. 12, 1937, 50 Stat. 622.

John B. Dudley and Randell S. Cobb, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., and Villard Martin, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellants.\n Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n As part of a flood control and hydroelectric development, the Grand River Dam Authority, an agency of the State of Oklahoma, was empowered to construct the Grand River Dam, with authority to borrow money and accept grants from the United States. Oklahoma Laws of 1935, Art. 4, c. 70, 82 Okl.St.Ann.  861 et seq. For the construction of the dam the United States allotted twenty million dollars to the Authority. Eight and one- half millions, in round numbers, were to be used as a grant, and eleven and one-half for the bonds of the Authority. Construction began in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 246, 248]\n\u00a0\n February, 1938, and by the spring of last year much of the work was nearing completion. During this period, the Governor of Oklahoma unsuccessfully pressed against the Authority claims for the flooding of roads within the dam area. The action which the Governor finally took to enforce his own views in this matter is the source of the present litigation. On March 13, 1940, he declared martial law in an area surrounding part of the dam-site and ordered the Adjutant General of the state to occupy it. The following day the Governor in conjunction with other state officials obtained an ex parte order in a state court restraining further work on the dam by the Authority. Thereupon the United States began the present suit in a federal district court. A temporary order was issued against the Governor and the other officials restraining them from interference with the Grand River project by further prosecution of their suit in the state court and by the use of military force. Deeming the suit to be one arising under  266 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, a district court of three judges was convened which, after hearing, entered an interlocutory injunction in the terms of the temporary restraining order. This is the decree that is now before us.\n But unless  266 required the present suit to be heard by three judges, under the Jurisdictional Act of 1925 we are without authority to entertain this direct appeal from a district court.  238 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345. Having concluded that there is a fatal bar to our entertaining the appeal, we are without power to consider the other issues that were argued here.\n By  266, which is set forth in the margin,1 Congress provided an exceptional procedure for a well-understood \n\n[312 \nU.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n type of controversy. The legislation was designed to secure the public interest in 'a limited class of cases of special importance'. Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565, 567\n, 48 S.Ct. 585, 586. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 246, 250]\n\u00a0\n It is a matter of history that this procedural device was a means of protecting the increasing body of state legislation regulating economic enterprise from invalidation by a conventional suit in equity. While Congress thus sought to assure more weight and greater deliberation by not leaving the fate of such litigation to a single judge, it was no less mindful that the requirement of three judges, of whom one must be a Justice of this Court or a circuit judge, entails a serious drain upon the federal judicial system particularly in regions where, despite modern facilities, distance still plays an important part in the effective administration of justice. And all but the few great metropolitan areas are such regions. Moreover, inasmuch as this procedure also brings direct review of a district court to this Court, any loose construction of the requirements of  266 would defeat the purposes of Congress, as expressed by the Jurisdictional Act of February 13, 1925, to keep within narrow confines our appellate docket. Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n272 \nU.S. 317, 321\n, 47 S.Ct. 105, 106.

Fidelity & Deposit Co., supra; Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S.Ct. 385; Ex parte Collins, supra; Oklahoma Gas Co. v.

Board of Com'rs, \n307 \nU.S. 208\n, 59 S.Ct. 808; Ex parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354\n, 60 S.Ct. 947), combine to reveal  266 not as a measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but as an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such.\n To bring this procedural device into play-to dislocate the normal operations of the system of lower federal courts and thereafter to come directly to this Court-requires a suit which seeks to interpose the Constitution against enforcement of a state policy, whether such policy is defined in a state constitution or in an ordinary statute or through the delegated legislation of an 'administrative board or commission'. The crux of the business is procedural protection against an improvident state-wide doom by a federal court of a state's legislative policy. This was the aim of Congress and this is the reconciling principle of the cases.\n To the test of this principle must be put the argument that the present case is within  266.\n The Oklahoma constitution has the customary provisions pertaining to the powers of a governor. In him is lodged 'The Supreme Executive power', he is 'Commander-in-Chief of the militia of the State' and he 'shall cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed'. Constitution of Oklahoma, Article VI,  2, 6, 8, Okl.St.Ann. Defining with particularity these powers, an Oklahoma statute \n\n[312 \nU.S. 246, 252]\n\u00a0\n 'authorized and required' its Governor to call out the national guard in case of war or similar contingencies including 'any forcible obstructing of the execution of the laws or reasonable apprehension thereof, and at all other times he may deem necessary ....' Oklahoma Statutes 1931,  4989, Okl.St.Ann. Title 44,  66. In its complaint the United States did not impugn the validity of these Oklahoma provisions. But the Governor justified his declaration of martial law under their authority, and since his action is deemed a lawless interference with the Government's constitutional rights, the suit is claimed to be an 'application for' an 'interlocutory injunction ... restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of' a statute of a State by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such a statute ... upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.'\n The claim proves too much. Probably most of the actions of governors trace back to the common provision charging them with taking care that the laws be faithfully executed. Some constitutional or statutory provision is the ultimate source of all actions by state officials. But an attack on lawless exercise of authority in a particular case is not an attack upon the constitutionality of a statute conferring the authority even though a misreading of the statute is invoked as justification. At least not within the Congressional scheme of  266. It is significant that the United States in its complaint did not charge the enabling acts of Oklahoma with unconstitutionality, but assailed merely the Governor's action as exceeding the bounds of law. In other words, it seeks a restraint not of a statute but of an executive action. But the enforcement of a 'statute', within the meaning of  266, is not sought to be enjoined merely because a state official seeks shelter under it by way of defense against a charge of lawlessness. As Mr. Justice \n\n[312 \nU.S. 246, 253]\n\u00a0\n Cardozo said of a related problem affecting the business of the federal courts, 'we do not travel back so far.' Gully v. First Nat. Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109, 116\n, 57 S.Ct. 96, 99.\n On its face,  266 precludes a reading which would bring within its scope every suit to restrain the conduct of a state official whenever, in the ultimate reaches of litigation, some enactment may be said to authorize the questioned conduct. The special procedure only attends 'the application for' an interlocutory injunction restraining enforcement of a statute. In other words, the complainant must seek to forestall the demands of some general state policy, the validity of which he challenges. No one questions Oklahoma's authority to give her Governor 'Supreme Executive power' nor to make him Commander-in-Chief of her militia. What is here challenged is a single, unique exercise of these prerogatives of his office. This view is reinforced by the proviso added to  266 by the Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1013, whereby suit in a federal court against the enforcement of a statute can be stayed if appropriate provision is made for testing its validity in the state courts. Of course, a suit cannot be brought in the court of a state to enforce a governor's declaration of martial law. In short, this is not a case for which the procedural structure of  266 was devised. If the Governor's action is subject to restraint in the District Court, the procedural road to be taken is the normal course of litigation in a federal district court and not the short cut of  266.\n Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378\n, 53 S.Ct. 190, which is invoked as a precedent, was a very different case. There martial law was employed in support of an order of the Texas Railroad Commission limiting production of oil in the East Texas field. The Governor was sought to be restrained as part of the main objective to enjoin 'the execution of an order made by an administrative ... commission', and as such was indubitably within  266. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 246, 254]\n\u00a0\n Compare Railroad Commission v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., \n311 \nU.S. 570\n, 61 S. Ct. 343, and Railroad Commission v. Humble Oil & Refining Co ., \n311 \nU.S. 578\n, 61 S.Ct. 347.\n Had a timely appeal been taken to the circuit court of appeals the decree below could have been reviewed there, though rendered by three judges. Healy v. Ratta, \n289 \nU.S. 701\n, 53 S.Ct. 522; Id., 1 Cir., 67 F.2d 554; Id., \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700.

U.S.(1941)\nNo. 36\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1941\n\n\n\n Mr. L. E. Gwinn, of Memphis, Tenn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wendell Berge, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted under an indictment charging violation of Section 32 of the Criminal Code. At the time of the alleged offense it read as follows:\n'Whoever, with intent to defraud either the United States or any person, shall falsely assume or pretend to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States, or any department, or any officer of the Government thereof, and shall take upon himself to act as such, or shall in such pretended character demand or obtain from any person or from the United States, or any department, or any officer of the Government thereof, any money, paper, document, or other valuable thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.' 35 Stat. 1095, 18 U.S.C.  76, 18 U.S.C.A.  76. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 307]\n\u00a0\n The conviction was affirmed, 6 Cir., 115 F.2d 399, and certiorari granted, \n313 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S.Ct. 841, on account of petitioner's heretofore undecided contention of manifest error in the trial court's refusal of an instruction that the statute did not include within its scope false personation of officers of employees of a government corporation, i.e., the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).\n\n The section has been upon the statute books since April 18, 1884. 23 Stat. 11. It was passed because of reports to Congress by the Pension Office of fraudulent practices affecting pension claimants. There is nothing in the legislative history which throws any light on the problem posed. \n1\n Nor do we find any fruitful comments in the various reports preliminary to the enactment of the Criminal Code which adopted the original language without significant change. \n2\n Subsequently to the acts forming the basis of the respective counts of the indictment, the section was amended to include pretending to be an officer or employee 'of any corporation owned or controlled by the United States.' Feb. 28, 1938, c. 37, 52 Stat. 82.\n The counts of the indictment which were submitted to the jury charged the defendant with falsely pretending to be an officer 'of the United States, to wit, (a representative) of the Government selling T.V.A. Units' then and there taking upon himself to act as such officer with intent to defraud separate individuals named in the counts or with obtaining from the named individuals stated sums of money with intent to defraud. The indictment states crimes under the statute. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 308]\n\u00a0\n On the trial it was stipulated that petitioner was not at any time an agent, employee or representative of the Government or any department thereof or of the TVA. It was shown that TVA was a government corporation and that it issued no stock or units for sale. The evidence further showed petitioner was editor and vice president of a newspaper, the Huntsville ( Alabama) Daily Register, and that the representations occurred during 'a community publicity advertising' campaign. He carried a letter from his paper introducing and identifying him as engaged in getting out 'the Muscle Shoals series of page newspaper advertisements,' and carried a bundle of the old issues of the paper as demonstrations of the publicity assistance to be given the TVA. The TVA units were participations in the cost of the page advertisements in the Daily Register, telling of the TVA benefits to the community, which cost the victims of the alleged swindle $ 10 each. Those who purchased by cash or check received on the spot receipts of the Daily Register signed by petitioner for the advertising cost paid. The wide publicity obtained from the construction of the TVA flood and power project had prepared the way for easy acceptance of the scheme by the credulous. Some subscribers to the units who felt they had been duped by the salesman testified to the circumstances of their fleecing on the occasions specified in the indictment. Their evidence showed to the satisfaction of the jury that Pierce, taking upon himself to act as a government employee, said or gave them the impression that he represented the Government, that the Government was contributing to the cost of the advertising for the development of TVA and that, as one witness phrased it, the purpose was 'Just the advancement of TVA in our country.' Another witness testified 'it never dawned on me that it was a personally owned newspaper.' \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 309]\n\u00a0\n All the counts included a charge of impersonation of a representative of the United States 'selling TVA units.' The evidence as to some was that Pierce said he represented TVA; as to others it was that he represented the Government selling TVA or TVA units. In no instance is there testimony that Pierce represented himself as an employee or officer of the United States unconnected with the public enterprise of the TVA at Muscle Shoals. The instructions followed the charges and evidence. They made clear that the charges against Pierce were for false impersonation by assuming to act as an officer or employee of the United States with fraudulent intent and not simply for obtaining money by false pretenses or false claim of stimulating the Tennessee Valley development. The instructions repeated with many variations the thought that Pierce must have actually and intentionally represented himself or assumed to be an officer of the United States, acting under its authority. References were made to TVA. It was said defendant was selling or attempting to sell TVA units. It was further pointed out that the mention of TVA in the copies of the Daily Register which were exhibited 'by the defendant to any person, from whom funds were solicited, and in the sales talks made by him, to such person should not be considered by you as evidence of a false claim or pretense of Federal Authority on the part of the defendant, Pierce, unless you further find and are satisfied from the proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, that such reference to TVA, in either the newspapers or sales talks, were made by the defendant with the intent of producing a belief on the part of the person from whom funds were solicited that he, the defendant Pierce, was acting as an officer or employee of the Federal Government.'\n There was a refusal by the trial court, however, to give the following instruction: \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 310]\n\u00a0\n 'At the request of the defendant, the Court further instructs the jury that the Tennessee Valley Authority, commonly designated as TVA, although an instrumentality of the Federal Government, is a corporate entity, separate and distinct from the Federal Government itself, and the officers and employees of that corporation are not within the scope of the Statute on which the indictment in this case is based. Consequently, any claim or representation by the defendant, if you find that such claim or representation was made, that he was representing the TVA, or was connected with the TVA as an officer or employee, would not constitute the false impersonation of an officer or employee of the United States Government or any department thereof, TVA officers and employees not being officers and employees of the Federal Government of some department thereof, within the meaning of the Statute which the defendant is alleged to have violated in the several counts of the indictment.'\n Nor do we find any comparable statement which was given. In this refusal we find material error.\n So closely entwined were the TVA and the Government [The United States] in the instructions and the evidence on the various counts that any jury might well have thought a pretense that Pierce was an employee or officer of the TVA violated the statute and have voted for conviction for that reason. This, however, in our view, is incorrect, and constitutes prejudicial error. Cf. Warszower v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 342\n, 61 S.Ct. 603; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373\n, 33 S.Ct. 780. The statute in effect at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses did not speak of pretenses of acting under authority of corporations owned or controlled by the United States. It was passed in 1884 before the United States owned or controlled corporations operating hotels, boat lines or generating plants. The amendments, subsequent to the occasions fixed by the indictment, extended \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 311]\n\u00a0\n its scope first to the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, 49 Stat. 298, 12 U.S. C.A.  1467(e), and later to all corporations owned or controlled by the United States, 52 Stat. 82.3 These legislative extensions of the scope of the act were in accord with the growing importance of the administrative corporation, but a comparable judicial enlargement of a criminal act by interpretation is at war with a fundamental concept of the common law that crimes must be defined with appropriate definiteness. Cf. Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n, 59 S.Ct. 618 and cases cited. While the act should be interpreted 'so as ... to give full effect to its plain terms,' Lamar v. United States, \n241 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 36 S.Ct. 535, 538; United States v. Barnow, \n239 \nU.S. 74\n, 36 S.Ct. 19, we should not depart from its \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 312]\n\u00a0\n words and context. Another section of the Criminal Code ( 35) was amended to meet the new development by the Act of October 23, 1918, 40 Stat. 1015, 18 U.S.C.A.  80, 82-86. Cf. United States v. Strang, \n254 \nU.S. 491\n, 41 S. Ct. 165. The TVA Act made certain federal penal statutes applicable to the Authority but pointedly omitted Section 32.4 This pointed omission is indicative of intention.\n Previous cases as to identity between the Government and its corporations turned on considerations not here applicable. In U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Western Union, \n275 \nU.S. 415, 426\n, 48 S.Ct. 198, 202, the Corporation was held a department of the Government within the meaning of the Post Roads Act and so entitled to lower telegraph rates than private corporations. An indictment under Criminal Code Section 37, 18 U.S.C.A.  88, for a conspiracy to defraud the United States 'in any manner' was held to state a crime when the contemplated fraud was upon the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation. United States v. Walter, \n263 \nU.S. 15, 17\n, 44 S.Ct. 10, 11. But this decision is bottomed on the broad ground that fraud which interferes with the successful operation of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 306, 313]\n\u00a0\n Government is within the statute. Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 479\n, 480 S., 30 S.Ct. 249, 253, 254, 17 Ann.Cas. 1112. On the other hand, in United States v. Strang, supra, in construing Criminal Code Section 415 this Court held an employee of the Fleet Corporation was not an agent of the United States within the true intendment of the section. The Strang case had the approval of the Court in the opinion deciding the Walter case. The statute in the Strang case points directly at a particular class of persons as the object of the sanction. It leaves, as does the statute here, no room for enlargement of its meaning.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissents on the ground that a false representation by the defendant that he was acting for the Tennessee Valley Authority constituted a false pretense that he was an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or a department thereof, within the meaning of  32 of the Criminal Code.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 15 Cong.Rec. 1285, 2256, 2627, 2676, 48th Cong., 1st Sess. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision of the Laws, Sen.

Hooper, Jr., of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, as Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, is the statutory liquidator of Auto Mutual Indemnity Company, an insolvent mutual insurance company, organized under the laws of New York. He brought this suit in the Superior Court of Georgia against respondents, who are residents of Georgia and policyholders in the company, to recover assessments alleged to be due by \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n virtue of their membership in it. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the judgment of the trial court, dismissing the petition on demurrers of the several respondents. 191 Ga. 502, 13 S.E.2d 337. We granted certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 555\n, 61 S.Ct. 1096, because of the asserted denial by Georgia of full faith and credit to certain statutes and judicial proceedings in New York, under which the assessment was levied.\n The relevant facts set out in the amended petition are as follows: The Indemnity Company, organized in 1932 under Article 10-B of the New York Insurance Law, Consol.Laws, c. 28,  340 et seq., as added by Laws 1916, c. 13, was, on application of the Superintendent of Insurance, placed in liquidation by order of the New York Supreme Court on November 24, 1937. Upon further proceedings, pursuant to  422 of the New York Insurance Law, as added by Laws 1932, c. 191,  1, the court ordered, August 12, 1938, that each member of the Indemnity Company, during the year prior to November 10, 1937, should pay assessments in specified amounts aggregating 40% of premiums earned by the Company during that year. The order directed that the members show cause on a specified date why they should not be held liable to pay and why the Superintendent should not have judgment for such assessments. Pursuant to  422 and the order, the Superintendent mailed notice of the order to each policyholder, including respondents. None of respondents entered an appearance. It is alleged that all 'were policyholders and members of the Company' during the year mentioned; that at the time when each purchased his policy and became a member there was in force  346 of the New York Insurance Law, as amended by Laws 1923, c. 811,  7, which under New York statutes and judicial decisions became a part of the insurance contract, binding upon each policyholder. Section 346 provides that every mutual insurance company 'shall in its by-laws and policies fix the contingent mutual liability of the members for the payment of losses and expenses not provided for by its admitted assets' to a spec- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 205]\n\u00a0\n ified extent, and that 'all assessments, whether levied by the board of directors, by the Superintendent of Insurance in the liquidation of the corporation, or otherwise, shall be for no greater amount than that specified in the policy and by-laws'. It is further alleged that the assessment made against respondents was for their pro rata share of the 40% assessment levied by order of the court pursuant to the statutes of New York and the by-laws of the company, and was confirmed as to members, including respondents, by the order of November 17, 1938. The form of policy acquired by respondents is by reference made a part of the petition.\n The Supreme Court of Georgia (191 Ga. 502, 13 S.E.2d 338), construing the amended petition as a whole, took its averment that respondents 'were policyholders and members of the company' to mean that they were members because they were policyholders. That construction has not been challenged and we adopt it here. The court accepted the allegations of the meaning and effect of the New York statutes and judicial decisions as correct, but held that respondents, none of whom was made a party to the New York proceedings by service of process, were not concluded by the New York orders and statutes on the question whether their relation as policyholders to the company was such as to subject them to liability.\n Examining the contract embodied in the policies, the court found that although the name of the company contained the word 'mutual' the contracts of insurance were without any term or provision purporting to make the policyholder a member of a mutual company or to subject him to assessment. Each policy provided that the insured agrees that it 'embodies all agreements existing between himself and the company or any of its agents relating to this insurance.' Printed on the back of each policy but not referred to in the contract was a 'Notice to policyholders' that 'the insured is hereby notified \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 206]\n\u00a0\n that by virtue of this policy he is a member of the Auto Mutual Indemnity Company', and that 'the contingent liability of the named insured under this policy shall be limited to one year from the expiration or cancellation hereof and shall not exceed the limits provided by the Insurance Law of the State of New York', there being on the face of the policy no reference to any contingent liability or assessment or to any law providing for such. The petition does not make it clear where the policies were delivered to respondents, and the court held that in the absence of a showing to the contrary they were governed by Georgia law.\n Applying to this state of facts the law and policy of Georgia derived from its statutes and judicial decisions, the court held that the relation between the insured and the company was that of contract, that the whole contract was embodied in the stipulations appearing on the face of the policy, and that it did not by its provisions make respondents members of the company or subject them to assessment in accordance with the laws of New York or otherwise. Petitioner challenges the judgment on the ground that it fails to accord to the New York orders and statutes the full faith and credit to which they are entitled under Article IV,  1 of the Constitution.\n While urging in brief and argument that all those who are shown to be members of the Indemnity Company are bound by the New York adjudication as to the necessity for and amount of the assessment, petitioner does not specifically urge that the New York proceedings have established the personal liability of respondents for the assessments which have been ordered. He could not well do so for the proceeding in the New York courts to determine what judgments should be entered against the policyholders, including non-residents, and the judgments actually entered, do not appear to have been made a part of the present record. See In re Auto Mutual Indemnity \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 207]\n\u00a0\n Co., Sup., 14 N.Y.S.2d 601. In any case it suffices for present purposes to say that New York does not attribute any such effect to the judgments of her courts rendered against absent non-resident defendants. See Kittredge v. Grannis, 244 N.Y. 182, 192-196, 155 N.E. 93; Geary v. Geary, 272 N.Y. 390, 398, 6 N.E.2d 67, 108 A.L.R. 1293; cf. Pope v. Heckscher, 266 N.Y. 114, 194 N.E. 53, 97 A.L.R. 687; Hood v. Guaranty Trust Co., 270 N.Y. 17, 200 N.E. 55. Such was the ruling in the New York proceeding for the liquidation of the Indemnity Company with which we are here concerned. See In re Auto Mutual Indemnity Co., supra, 14 N.Y.S.2d 611, where the referee's opinion states: '... no personal judgment will be ordered against non-resident members or policyholders who have not appeared generally or been served personally with process within the State, although, as hereinabove set forth, they are bound by the finding of the necessity for the assessment and the amount thereof.'\n It is a familiar rule that those who become stockholders in a corporation subject themselves to liability for assessment when made in conformity to the statutes of the state of its organization, although they are not made parties to the proceeding for levying it. Hawkins v. Glenn, \n131 \nU.S. 319\n, 9 S.Ct. 739; Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640\n, 20 S.Ct. 506; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516\n, 27 S.Ct. 755; Converse v.

Whether we support these legal consequences by reference to consent of the stockholder or to his assumption of a corporate relationship subject to the regulatory power of the state of incorporation, in either case the procedure conforms to accepted principles, involves no want of due process, and is entitled to full faith and credit so far as the necessity and amount of the assessment are concerned. See Christopher v. Brusselback, \n302 \nU.S. 500\n, 58 S.Ct. 350, and cases cited. The like principle has been consistently applied \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 208]\n\u00a0\n to mutual insurance associations, where the fact that the policyholders were members was not contested. Supreme Council of Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531\n, 35 S.Ct. 724, L.R.A.1916A, 771; Modern Woodmen v. Mixer, \n267 \nU.S. 544\n, 45 S.Ct. 389, 41 A.L.R. 1384. The Supreme Court of Georgia found it unnecessary to consider the application of these authorities to the present case, since it decided that respondents, by acquiring the particular form of policy issued by the Indemnity Company, did not become members of it.\n It is evident that if the constitutional authority of the Indemnity Company to stand in judgment for its absent members turns on their consent or their assumption of membership in the Company, respondents, who were not parties to the New York proceedings, may defend on the ground that they never became members because they have done no act signifying such consent or assumption. After an assessment has been lawfully levied on the members of a corporation, it is still open to any who were not parties to the assessment proceeding to defend on the ground that they never became stockholders.

Armour Fertilizer Works, \n237 \nU.S. 413, 423\n, 35 S.Ct. 625, 628; Supreme Council of Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 35 S.Ct. 724, 728, L.R. A.1916A, 771; Chandler v. Peketz, \n297 \nU.S. 609, 611\n, 56 S.Ct. 602, 603; cf. Hawkins v. Glenn, \n131 \nU.S. 319, 335\n, 9 S.Ct. 739, 744. Ordinarily this means no more than that they have not acquired or owned stock in the corporation during the relevant period. For a necessary consequence of becoming a stockholder is the assumption of those obligations which, by the laws governing the organization and management of the corporation, attach to stock ownership.\n Other considerations may be significant in determining whether a membership in a mutual insurance company has been effected through acquisition of a policy. A mere contract is not a share of stock and when made with a corporation or association does not necessarily connote membership in it. A policy of insurance may be a contract \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 209]\n\u00a0\n whose terms purport to define completely the relationship and obligations of the parties. Here the policy, which was on its face a contract and nothing more, stipulated only for obligations to be performed by the insurer upon payment of the prescribed premium. The policy's stipulations contained no provision making the insured a member of the association or subjecting him to liability for assessment as such. Although the company was denominated 'mutual', that term does not necessarily signify that policyholders are members or subject to assessment.\n Without the command of some constitutionally controlling statute, the Georgia court was free to interpret the obligation of the policy as limited to those stipulations expressed on its face and as excluding any stipulation for membership or for liability to assessment which the contract did not mention. Petitioner finds such a command in the New York statutes which he asserts make all policyholders liable to assessment without the aid of any stipulation to that effect in the policy. He relies on the full faith and credit clause to exact obedience to the statutes.\n Every state has authority under the Constitution to establish laws through both its judicial and its legislative arms, which are controlling upon its inhabitants and domestic affairs. When it is demanded in the domestic forum that the operation of those laws be supplanted by the statute of another state, that forum is not bound, apart from the full faith and credit clause, to yield to the demand, and the law of neither can, by its own force, determine the choice of law for the other. Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 231; Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 493, 500\n, 59 S.Ct. 629, 632; Kryger v. Wilson, \n242 \nU.S. 171, 176\n, 37 S.Ct. 34, 35; Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412\n, 38 S.Ct. 147; Griffin v. McCoach, \n313 \nU.S. 498\n, 61 S.Ct. 1023, 134 A.L.R. 1462.\n To the extent that Georgia must give full faith and credit to the New York statutes and judicial proceedings, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 210]\n\u00a0\n it must be denied authority to adjudicate the meaning and domestic effect under its own laws of a contract entered into by its own inhabitants and containing no stipulation that they should be bound by obligations extrinsically imposed by New York law. But the full faith and credit clause is not an inexorable and unqualified command. It leaves some scope for state control within its borders of affairs which are peculiarly its own. This Court has often recognized that, consistent with the appropriate application of the full faith and credit clause, there are limits to the extent to which the laws and policy of one state may be subordinated to those of another. Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 532\n, 55 S.Ct. 518, Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 493\n, 59 S.Ct. 629; Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Co., \n313 \nU.S. 487, 497\n, 498 S., 61 S.Ct. 1020, 1022; see Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 273\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 232.\n It was the purpose of that provision to preserve rights acquired or confirmed under the public acts and judicial proceedings of one state by requiring recognition of their validity in others. But the very nature of the federal union of states, to each of which is reserved the sovereign right to make its own laws, precludes resort to the Constitution as the means for compelling one state wholly to subordinate its own laws and policy concerning its peculiarly domestic affairs to the laws and policy of others. When such conflict of interest arises it is for this Court to resolve it by determining how far the full faith and credit clause demands the qualification or denial of rights asserted under the laws of one state, that of the forum, by the public acts and judicial proceedings of another. See Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 532, 547\n, 55 S.Ct. 518, 523; Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 493\n, 59 S.Ct. 629.\n Where a resident of one state has by stipulation or stock ownership become a member of a corporation or association of another, the state of his residence may have no such domestic interest in preventing him from fulfilling the obligations of membership as would admit of a restricted \n\n[314 \nU.S. 201, 211]\n\u00a0\n application of the full faith and credit clause. But it does have a legitimate interest in determining whether its residents have assented to membership obligations sought to be imposed on them by extrastate law to which they are not otherwise subject.\n Without the aid of agreement or consent, the laws of the state of organization can be imposed on Georgia courts and policyholders only so far as the full faith and credit clause compels it. The undue extension of the statutes and authority of a state beyond its own borders by the expedient of rendering a judgment against non-citizens over whose persons or property the state has acquired jurisdiction, may infringe due process. Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701. Like, but more cogent, reasons may call for the restriction of the full faith and credit clause as the instrument for controlling the law and policy of one state, with respect to its domestic affairs, by the statutory command of another.\n The interpretation and legal effect of policies of insurance entered into by the inhabitants of Georgia, who are sued upon them in its courts, are peculiarly matters of local concern. Griffin v. McCoach, \n313 \nU.S. 498\n, 61 S.Ct. 1023. Were it not for the New York statute, there could be no question of Georgia's authority to adjudicate the rights and obligations arising under the policies. And as we have seen, the only basis for the imposition by New York of its command on the Georgia court and policyholders is the assumption by the latter of membership in the New York company. But this, in the circumstances of this case, depends upon the meaning and effect of all the provisions appearing on the policies with respect to the assumption of membership, which is for Georgia to determine. There being no question of evasion of constitutional obligation, we accept that determination as one of domestic law and policy which the full faith and credit clause does not override.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPITTSBURGH PLATE GLASS CO. v.

National Labor R. Board \n313 \nU.S. 146\n (1941) ]\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. W. McAfee, of St. Louis, Mo., and Leland Hazard, and Joseph T. Owens, both of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.\n Mr. Henry H. Oberschelp, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner Crystal City Glass Workers' Union.\n Francis B. Biddle, Sol. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners in the two cases covered by these certioraris1 are the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, an employer, and the Crystal City Glass Workers Union, an 'independent' or 'local' union, that is a union unaffiliated with any other employee organization. Charged with an unfair labor practice in refusing to bargain collectively with duly accredited representatives of its employees, the Company countered the complaint with the assertion that it had and did bargain collectively with the proper representatives of its employees but that it denied the validity of a Board decision including the Crystal City plant of the Company as a part of the appropriate bargaining unit. The central issue thus is the legality of the Labor Board's decision, under section 9(b) of the National Labor Relations Act,2 determining that 'the production and maintenance employees of the Company' at all six plants of its flat glass division, as a whole, constitute the appropriate unit for collective bargaining for the Crystal City employees, rather than the employees of the Crystal City plant only. The Board's conclusion is challenged on the merits, on procedural and on constitutional grounds. The certioraris were granted because of the importance of the 'appropriate unit' problem in the administration of the Act.\n The six plants of the flat glass division are located in five different states: Ford City, Pennsylvania; Creighton, Pennsylvania; Mount Vernon, Ohio; Clarksburg, West Virginia; Henryetta, Oklahoma; and Crystal City, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 150]\n\u00a0\n Missouri. 3 The normal number of employees in the whole division is about 6,500. The Crystal City plant, with 1,600, and the slightly larger plants at Ford City and Creighton account for the bulk of these workers; the remaining three together employ only about 1,000. The Federation of Flat Glass Workers, an affiliate of the Congress of Industrial Organization, has a majority of all the employees in the flat glass division and also a majority at each plant except Crystal City. Its position, which the Board sustained, is that the entire division should be a single bargaining unit. The Crystal City Union, which claims a majority at that plant, and the Company both contend that the circumstances of this case require Crystal City to be separated from the rest of the division for the purpose of fixing the unit.\n The present proceedings are the third stage of this labor dispute. Originally, in June, 1938, the Board filed a complaint against the Company alleging domination of and interference with the Crystal City Union in violation of sections 8(1) and (2), 9 U.S.C.A.  158 (1, 2).4 The Crystal City Union was not named as a party in that proceeding. Before any hearing had been held the Company consented to entry of an order that it would cease and desist from dominating or contributing to the Crystal City Union or from recognizing or dealing with it as a labor organization. The Board issued the stipulated order in September, 1938, and later, also pursuant to the stipulation, obtained an enforcement order from the Circuit Court \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 151]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals. 5 The Federation of Flat Glass Workers, which had filed the charges leading to the issuance of the complaint, also had requested an investigation and certification of representatives pursuant to section 9(c) of the Act. Extensive hearings on this second stage took place in October, 1938, at which the Crystal City Union appeared and participated. On January 13, 1939, the Board issued its decision fixing the bargaining unit and certification of representatives. The Board found that the Company's production and maintenance employees throughout the entire flat glass division (with the exception of window glass cutters, clerical employees not directly connected with production, and supervisory employees) constitute an appropriate unit, and it certified the Federation as the exclusive representative of all the employees in the unit. \n6\n This order, under our ruling in American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board,7 was not subject to direct judicial review under section 10(f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(f). The Company, however, continued to assert that the Crystal City plant should be excluded from the unit, and refused to bargain with the Federation with respect to that group of employees. Accordingly, about a month after its certification order, the Board issued a complaint in this proceeding, the third and pending stage of the labor dispute, alleging a refusal to bargain collectively in violation of sections 8(1) and (5). At the hearing on this complaint, at which the Crystal City Union was permitted to intervene, the trial examiner excluded a certain offer of proof by it and the Company. For various reasons the Board found that the exclusion was in part proper and for the rest non-prejudicial. On the merits the Board, with one member dissenting, adhered to its \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 152]\n\u00a0\n original view that the Crystal City plant should be included in the unit and therefore found that the Company had committed an unfair labor practice. \n8\n The Company and the Crystal City Union sought review of the Board's decision in the Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed,9 and we brought the case here on certiorari.\n To reach a conclusion upon the complaint under consideration against the Company of unfair labor practices, violating section 8, subsections (1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, the validity of the Board's decision as to the appropriate unit must be decided. As the unfair practice charged was the refusal to bargain collectively because of the inclusion of the Crystal City employees in the unit, if they were improperly included the complaint fails.\n The Labor Act places upon the Board the responsibility of determining the appropriate group of employees for the bargaining unit. In accordance with this delegation of authority, the Board may decide that all employees of a single employer form the most suitable unit for the selection of collective bargaining representatives, or the Board may decide that the workers in any craft or plant or subdivision thereof are more appropriate. 10 The \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 153]\n\u00a0\n petitioners' contention that section 9(a) grants to the majority of employees in a unit appropriate or such purposes the absolute right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing11 is correct only in the sense that the 'appropriate unit' is the one declared by the Board under section 9(b), not one that might be deemed appropriate under other circumstances. In its Annual Reports, the Board has stated the general considerations which motivate its action:\n'In determining whether the employees of one, several, or all plants of an employer, or the employees in all or only a part of a system of communications, transportation, or public utilities, constitute an appropriate unit for the purposes of collective bargaining, the Board has taken into consideration the following factors: (1) the history, extent, and type of organization of the employees; (2) the history of their collective bargaining, including any contracts; (3) the history, extent, and type of organization, and the collective bargaining, of employees of other employers in the same industry; (4) the relationship between any proposed unit or units and the employer's organization, management, and operation of his business, including the geographical location of the various plants or parts of the system; and (5) the skill, wages, working conditions, and work of the employees.'12\n\n In its hearings on the appropriate unit the Board received evidence as to the organization of the Com- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n pany, the variety of its business, its distribution of this business into divisions and the location, size and method of operation of its flat glass plants, which composed the flat glass division. The history of collective bargaining in the business was developed. Finally the relation of the several plants of the flat glass division was examined and the characteristics of each plant and their respective employees gone into. From this evidence the Board determined that the production and maintenance employees of the six scattered flat glass plants were the appropriate unit and that the Federation, which had majorities of the employees in all the plants except Crystal City, was the labor representative for purposes of collective bargaining.\n The Company and the local union contend that Crystal City's inclusion was erroneous because neither in the hearings on the appropriate unit nor on this unfair labor practice did the Board permit the introduction of material evidence on the question of appropriate units, the exclusion of which was prejudicial to the respondents.\n While the ruling of the Board determining the appropriate unit for bargaining is not subject to direct review under the statute, the ruling is subject to challenge when, as here, a complaint of unfair practices is made predicated upon the ruling. \n13\n Petitioners press that challenge upon the ground (1) that the procedure denied due process of law, (2) that there was no substantial evidence to justify the uling, and (3) that the authority granted the Board is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.\n First. Petitioners find in the refusal of the Board to admit certain proffered evidence in the unit hearing and \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 155]\n\u00a0\n in this hearing a denial of due process in that the exclusion was illegal and arbitrary in depriving the parties of a full and fair hearing as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. The petitioners sought to adduce the excluded evidence by petition to the Circuit Court of Appeals for an order that the additional evidence be taken by the Board. \n14\n This was denied.\n There is no challenge to the September 22, 1938, order of the Board, subsequently affirmed by the Court,15 in the original proceeding where the Crystal City Glass Workers' Union was not a party. This withdraws the employer's recognition of the Union as the employees' representative 'as a labor organization.' As the order does not run against the Union, its presence was unnecessary. \n16\n After such an order the employer may not be compelled by any other agency of the government to perform any acts inconsistent with that ordder. \n17\n While it leaves the Union's private rights untouched this order does forbid further dealings by the Company with the Union as labor representative of the employees. National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 366\n, 60 S.Ct. 569, 578.\n Acquiescing, for the argument, in the conclusion that selection of the appropriate unit is a function of the Board, petitioners urge that this function must be exercised in the light of properly available evidence. Much may be and was said upon either side of the issue as to whether Crystal City plant or the flat glass division would be the most efficient collective bargaining unit. Additional evidence might have brought the Board to a \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 156]\n\u00a0\n different conclusion. Hence, urge petitioners, the Board's refusal to permit the introduction of certain evidence before it, either in the hearing on the appropriate unit and certification of representatives or in this present hearing on unfair labor practices predicated upon that determination and certification, is important. As the Board's conclusion upon the approprite unit determined that the Federation, the choice of a majority in the selected unit, would be the bargaining representative for all, including the Crystal City employees, we need not give specific consideration to the refusal of the Board to certify the petitioner, the Crystal City Glass Workers' Union, as the bargaining representative of those workers. Certification of the bargaining representative follows the determination of the appropriate unit. As will presently appear, however, this does not dispose of the admissibility of evidence as to the Crystal City workers' desire to be represented by the Union. This is a fact which has a bearing on the determination of the appropriate unit.\n For the same reason, the availability of a workers' organization for purposes of representation is not in itself decisive in determining the appropriate bargaining unit. Naturally the wishes of employees are a factor in a Board conclusion upon a unit. They are to be weighed with the similarity of working duties and conditions, the character of the various plants and the anticipated effectiveness of the unit in maintaining industrial peace through collective bargaining. It can hardly be said that the domination of a labor union by an employer is irrelevant to t e question of what unit is appropriate for the choice of labor representative but certainly it is a collateral matter in that investigation. It is only a fact to take into consideration. If the unit chosen has an employer dominated union, the workers may be given an opportunity to choose representatives, free of this infirmity, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 157]\n\u00a0\n and if the union is free of employer influence, it may be chosen as representative. In short, domination pertains directly to representation but influences the choice of a unit only casually.\n Turning to the refusal of the Board to admit tendered evidence in this case, there are five instances alleged as error. \n18\n In the next preceding paragraph we have referred to the first, the desire of 1,500 workers out of 1,800 in the Crystal City plant to have that plant a bargaining unit and their opposition to Federation representation. This was before the Board. The petition of the Crystal City workers was presented in the hearing on the appropriate unit, was admitted and considered. \n19\n It is entirely proper for the Board to utilize its knowledge \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 158]\n\u00a0\n of the desires of the workers obtained in the prior unit proceeding, since both petitioners, the employer and the Crystal City Union, were parties to that prior proceeding. \n20\n The unit proceeding and this complaint on unfair labor practices are really one. \n21\n Consequently the refusal to admit further evidence of the attitude of the workers is unimportant.\n The second offer refused is to produce evidence that the Crystal City Union, contrary to the previous finding of the Board in a distinct proceeding in which the Union was \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 159]\n\u00a0\n not a party,22 is free of employer domination. The entry of the order upon stipulation and consent does not detract from its force. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311, 327\n, 48 S.Ct. 311, 315. As previously explained this question of domination is a collateral issue to the determination of the appropriate unit and we think to refuse to hear again upon a subject this remote from the inquiry was well within the discretion of the Board. \n23\n On September 22, 1938, the Board issued its cease and desist order directed against 'recognizing or dealing with the Union as a labor organization' and on January 13, 1939, its appropriate unit order. The first order is not attacked. it is true that the Board based its refusal to permit this evidence partly on the finality of the original order. But it was of the view that the Crystal City Union had not availed itself of its chance to enter an appearance or voluntarily intervene \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 160]\n\u00a0\n in that proceeding. \n24\n The Board had just barred the Company from dominating the Union and caused it to withdraw recognition from it as an employee labor organization. At the hearing on the appropriate unit, at which all parties here were represented and took active part, full investigation was made of the relevant criteria to determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The history of the Federation was appraised, its efforts at division-wide collective bargaining, the opposition of Crystal City employees to the Federation and the characteristics of the various plants. These are factors which the Board thought determinative of the appropriate unit. Whether the Union was dominated by the employer or not was not stressed in fixing the unit. Counsel for the Union stated his position at the unit hearing as follows:\n'I want to make a statement inasmuch as counsel for the Federation of Flat Glass Workers has made his statement. Very briefly I want to state the position of the Crystal City Glass Workers' Union. When the first statement was made by counsel, t was apparent that this proceeding is going to revolve about the Crystal City plant, which is Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company Plant No. 9. We expect to show on behalf of Plant No. 9 that approximately 1,300 out of the total of 1,600 employees are members of the Crystal City Glass Workers' Union. We expect to show that with reference to the integration at the plant the conditions are entirely different, they are very different in Crystal City than in any other plant. We expect to show that there are certain distinct features with reference to the Crystal City plant that do not exist at any other plant.\n\n'We expect to show further that community conditions differ entirely at Crystal City from what they are at any other plant. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 161]\n\u00a0\n 'We expect to show that the social status, the economic status and the community status in general of the employees who work in the Crystal City plant is entirely different than it is in any other plant of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.\n\n'If we show those things we feel that the proper unit for the Crystal City plant is the plant unit because of the conditions that I have mentioned, and if any other organization with any other unit was recognized at that plant, it would defeat the purpose of the Act.'\n\n Each of these points was fully covered by the evidence before the Board on the unit hearing, with the result that the Crystal City Union received a full and complete hearing on every proposition covered by the statement.\n The refusal to reconsider the issue of domination in the present unfair labor practice hearing accords, in our view, with the Board's discretionary powers.\n The other three instances may be listed in the language of the Board, adopted by petitioners, as follows: (3) that the employees at the Crystal City plant had distinct interests from employees at the Company's other plants; (4) that the Crystal City Union had bargained collectively with the Company for its members until the Company refused to continue such bargaining because of the charges filed against it by the Federation; and ( 5) that since the stipulation of July 22, 1938, was entered into by the Board, the Company and the Federation, and since the Board's decision of January 13, 1939, the membership of the Crystal City Union had increased.\n With respect to item (3), the distinct interests of the Crystal City employees, the Board ruled that in the unit proceeding the Company and the Crystal City Union were given full opportunity to present such evidence, and in the present proceeding neither of them had indicated that the proof sought to be admitted related to evidence unavailable at, discovered since, or not in- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 162]\n\u00a0\n troduced in, the unit hearing. The full justification for this ruling by the Board becomes clear only after an examination of the record in the unit proceeding, which under section 9(d) of the Act is part of the record here.\n The Crystal City Union appeared at the unit proceeding; it participated in the hearings; it called witnesses, and cross-examined those called by the other parties. A great deal of the hearing was taken up by testimony designed to bring out any interests of the Crystal City workers that might be distinct from those of employees at other plants. Thus there was abundant testimony with respect to their racial origins, their agricultural surroundings, their inclination or disinclination to visit cities, their lack of a 'union' background, their recreational habits, etc. There was also a thorough canvassing of all the details in which the processes of production and the working conditions at Crystal City diverged from those at the other plants. If the Company or the Crystal City Union desired to relitigate this issue, it was up to them to indicate in some way that the evidence they wished to offer was more than cumulative. Nothing more appearing, a single trial of the issue was enough.\n As to (4), collective bargaining by the Crystal City Union, and (5), that Union's growing membership at Crystal City, the Board said:\n'Accepting the foregoing offer of proof as correctly stating the facts nevertheless, in view of the proceedings against the respondent culminating in the court de cree of January 14, 1939, negotiations between the respondent and the Crystal City Union cannot be regarded by the Board as evidence of genuine collective bargaining; nor can the Crystal City Union's membership and representation of employees at the Crystal City plant be considered by the Board as expressing the free \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 163]\n\u00a0\n choice of the employees at that plant or as establishing the existence of another labor organization, in addition to the Federation, capable of bargaining collectively with the respondent for the employees there.'25\n\n The fact that the local union had undertaken negotiations with the employer or that it had grown in numbers would be of slight probative value in a proceeding to determine the bargaining unit. The Board might properly say as it did that accepting the offers of proof it would not alter the determination of the appropriate unit.\n Further, if we consider all the contentions about exclusion of evidence together instead of separately, we do not find that in the aggregate the evidence excluded could have materially affected the outcome on the 'appropriate unit' issue, in the light of the criteria by which the Board determined that issue.\n Second. Petitioners complain that the record contains no evidence to support certain essential findings. One of these is the finding in regard to the history of collective bargaining. The Board determined that the Federation after 1934 and until 1937 held written labor agreements covering their members in all the plants of the Company, including Crystal City:\n'Not until January 20, 1937, did the Company for the first time insist that Crystal City be excluded from the agreement between it and the Federation on the ground that the Federation did not have as members a majority of the employees at this plant. The written agreement signed on that day, at the insistence of the Company, despite the Federation's objections, did not cover the Federation members at Crystal City.' \n26\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 164]\n\u00a0\n The Board thought the evidence justified the conclusion that the Federation had sought and sometimes succeeded in organizing the Company on a 'division-wide' basis. An examination of the contracts shows that three were entered into with the Federation between 1934 and 1937, all three of which recognized obligations towards 'employees who are members of the Federation of Flat Glass Workers of America.' Another granted a five per cent wage increase 'in all plate and safety glass plants.' This included Crystal City. There was testimony that all plants were covered and testimony by petitioners that the Crystal City plant was not covered. There were certain provisions applicable only where a plant had a local union. There was none at Crystal City. The evidence, we conclude, justifies the Board's finding that contracts were signed on a division- wide basis. Certainly the express exclusion of Crystal City employees in the 1937 contract on the employer's demand shows an endeavor to organize on that basis.\n\n Petitioners find failure of evidence to establish the appropriateness of the division-wide unit. It is true the record shows a substantial degree of local autonomy. Crystal City is a separate industrial unit, not one mechanically integrated into the division. The local superintendent deals with labor grievances, the plant has its own purchasing agent and there is no exchange of employees. On the other hand, labor policies and wages come from the central office in Pittsburgh, there is great similarity in the class of work done. Wages, hours, working conditions, manufacturing processes differ only slightly among the plants. An independent unit at Crystal City, the Board was justified in finding, would frustrate division-wide effort at labor adjustments. It would enable the employer to use the plant there for continuous operation in case of stoppage of labor at the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 165]\n\u00a0\n other plants. \n27\n We are of the view that there was adequate evidence to support the conclusion that the bargaining unit should be division-wide.\n Third. Finally petitioners urge that the standards for Board action as to the appropriate unit are inadequate to give a guide to the administrative action and the result is necessarily capricious, arbitrary and an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. We find adequate standards to guide the Board's decision. While the exact limits of the Board's powers or the precise meaning of the terms have not been fully defined, judicially, we know that they lie within the area covered by the words 'employer,' 'plant,' and 'craft.' 28 The division-wide unit here deemed appropriate is well within these limits. As a standard, the Board must comply, also, with the requirement that the unit selected must be one to effectuate the policy of the act, the policy of efficient collective bargaining. Where the policy of an act is so definitely and elab- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 166]\n\u00a0\n orately stated, this requirement acts as a permitted measure of delegated authority. \n29\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment below should be reversed.\n The Board's order, so far as it directs petitioner, the Glass Company, to recognize and bargain with respondent Federation as the representative of the Company's employees at its Crystal City plant, cannot be sustained unless the Board's certification of the Federation as the appropriate bargaining agency for those employees is upheld. I think that both should be set aside because of the Board's failure in those proceedings to afford to petitioner, Crystal City Glass Workers' Union, an 'appropriate hearing', and its failure to determine the unfair labor practice issue on the evidence, both of which, to say nothing of constitutional requirements, are commanded by  9(c) and 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n The Federation, affiliated with the C.I.O., has organized local unions at each of the Company's six plants except that at Crystal City, whose employees, some 1,600 in number, have been organized by the Union. The Company has recognized and bargained with the Federation as the representative of its employees at all except its Crystal City plant. In 1934 it entered into a written contract with the Federation which provided a method of settling grievances of employees at all its \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 167]\n\u00a0\n plants, through local unions of the Federation. These provisions were renewed in 1935 but as the efforts of the Federation to organize a local union at Crystal City, begun in 1933 and continued actively during 1937 and since, have never succeeded, those provisions have remained inoperative at Crystal City. The renewal contract with the Federation in 1937, which is still in force, does not include the Crystal City plant.\n The Union was incorporated in 1938. In April it organized the employees at the Crystal City plant and in the following month the Board, on petition of the Federation, instituted the certification proceeding now before us. In June of that year the Board issued its complaint, charging the Company with unfair labor practices, specifically alleging that it had 'dominated and interfered with the formation and administration' of the Union. The Company answered denying the allegation. The Union was not a party to the proceeding and so far as appears had no knowledge of it. The Board, without taking any evidence and without making any finding of an unfair labor practice, which is prerequisite to an order under  10(c), made its order, on consent of the Company, directing it to cease and desist from 'in any manner dominating or interfering with the administration' of the Union, or 'contributing aid or support' to it and 'from recognizing or dealing with it'. The usual provision disestablishing the Union was omitted from the order.\n As soon as the Board had made this order it proceeded with hearings in the certification proceeding in which both the Federation and the Union participated and in which the Board certified the Federation as the appropriate bargaining agency for the employees in all six of the Company's plants.\n Upon the refusal of the Company to recognize the Federation as the agent of its employees at Crystal City, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 168]\n\u00a0\n the Board, on complaint of the Federation began the present unfair labor practice proceeding against the Company. An agreement was then entered into between the Company and the Federation that the existing bargaining contract with the Federation, which did not include Crystal City, should remain in force pending a final determination of the appropriate bargaining unit for Crystal City.\n In the present unfair labor practice proceeding the Board reconsidered and heard evidence on the question of the appropriate unit. In the course of the hearings both the Union and the Company offered to prove: (1) that 1,500 out of the 1,800 employees at Crystal City belonged to the Union and that these members were opposed to being represented by the Federation; (2) that the Union was not dominated by nor had its formation or administration been interfered with by the Company and that the Company had not contributed to its financial or other support; (3) that the employees at Crystal City had distinct interests from those at the other plants of the Company; (4) that the representatives of the Union had bargained collectively for its members with the Company until the Company declined to continue such bargaining by reason of the consent order of September, 1938, which the Board had entered against it, to which order and proceedings leading to it the Union was not a party; and (5) that since the order was made and since the certification of the Federation as the representative for collective bargaining of all the employees the membership in the Union had increased.\n All of these offers were rejected and the proffered evidence was excluded. The Board reaffirmed its finding in the certification proceeding that the Federation was the appropriate bargaining agency and made its order directing the company to bargain with the Federation. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 169]\n\u00a0\n One member of the Board, Mr. Leiserson, dissented, on the ground that the Board's decision was based upon an assumption that the Crystal City employees were incapable of making a free choice of representatives and that the Board's order imposed on the employees at that plant a representative not of their own choosing without any opportunity to express their own choice as to represent tion, and that it disregarded the history of the bargaining by the Company with the employees at the Crystal City plant and its existing contract with the Federation which excluded the Crystal City plant from its operation.\n Throughout the certification and the later unfair labor practice proceedings the Board took the position that the Union and the Glass Company, because of the consent order against the Company, were no longer free to urge the wishes of the Union members as to representation or to show the actual bargaining relation between the Union and the Company or that the Company did not in fact dominate the Union. In the certification proceeding the Board stated that the Union, by reason of the consent order, had 'ceased to be able to function as a labor organization and its existence as such at Crystal City then terminated' and that 'Since the Crystal City Union can no longer function as a labor organization its wishes are immaterial'.\n In reviewing the evidence in the unfair labor practice proceeding the Board adhered to its view that the Union by reason of the consent order must be treated by it as dominated by the Company and that for that reason the proffered and rejected evidence on this point was without weight, and that accordingly it must be taken that there never had been a 'genuine and legitimate attempt by the Crystal City employees to bargain with the Company separately from the other plants.' \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 170]\n\u00a0\n A substantial part of the Board's findings in both proceedings is devoted to the inferences justifying its conclusion as to the appropriate unit, which it drew from this so-called finding of domination derived wholly from the consent order. It found that the wishes of the union were immaterial since under the order, it could no longer function as a labor organization. It stated that the existence of the Union for more than three years 'to a large degree explains the desire of the 1500 Crystal City Employees for a separate bargaining unit as expressed in their petition, and such desires may well undergo a radical change as the effect of the termination of the Crystal City Union's function as a labor organization is fully realized by those employees'.\n In addition the Board thought that the evidence of negotiations between the Company and the Union, could not be 'evidence of genuine collective bargaining'; it found that the membership of the large majority of the Crystal City employees in the Union cannot be considered 'as expressing the free choice of the employees at that plant, or as establishing the existence of another labor organization, in addition to the Federation, capable of bargaining with the respondent (company) for the employees there'; and it declared that one of the factors leading to the conclusion 'that the interests of all the employees of the various plants are interwoven and that collective bargaining for all the employees involved can most effectively be achieved through the establishment of a single bargaining unit', was 'the fact that the membership of the Crystal City union is coerced and not voluntary.' Thus on the questions as to the desires of the employees in each of the six plants and the history of collective bargaining there-both factors which the Board has uniformly considered heretofore in determining the probable effectiveness of future bargaining on the basis of a unit claimed to be appropriate-the Board \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 171]\n\u00a0\n has not only rejected proffered evidence, admittedly relevant, but has drawn conclusions contrary to the rejected evidence, from facts found by the Board to be true, only by treating the conflicting evidence tendered by the Union as without weight.\n In order to appraise the issues in the several proceedings before the Board and its action taken with respect to them, it is necessary to consider the function which the Board was called on to perform both in the certification proceedings and the unfair labor practice proceeding, both of which are now before us for review as provided by  9(d) of the ct. Section 9(a) provides that representatives 'designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining.' And under  9(b) it is the duty of the Board to 'decide in each case whether, in order to insure to employees the full benefit of their right to self-organization and to collective bargaining, and otherwise to effectuate the policies of the Act (this chapter), the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof.' The policies of the Act which the Board is to effectuate by its choice of the proper bargaining unit, are declared by  1 to be the mitigation and elimination of obstructions to interstate commerce resulting from labor disputes 'by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing,' for purposes of collective bargaining 'or other mutual aid or protection.'\n It will be observed that the function assigned to the Board is not the choice of the labor organization to rep- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 172]\n\u00a0\n resent a bargaining unit, for that is to be the free choice of the majority of the employees in some defined group of employees which the Board finds to constitute the appropriate unit. In making the choice of the unit, whether composed of the employees of a plant, a craft, or of an employer, the Board is required to observe the standards prescribed by the Act, which are 'to insure to employees the full benefit of their right to self-organization and to collective bargaining' and to protect 'the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing.'\n These are obviously the standards to be applied in a certification proceeding under  9(c) which provides that when a question arises 'concerning the representation of employees, the Board may investigate such controversy and certify to the parties, in writing, the name or names of the representatives that have been designated or selected. In any such investigation, the Board shall provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice, either in conjunction with a proceeding under  10 (section 160 of this title) (complaints for unfair labor practices) or otherwise, and may take a secret ballot of employees, or utilize any other suitable method to ascertain such representatives.' A similar requirement is imposed on the Board upon complaint of unfair labor practices.\n It is evident therefore that in the present proceeding the Board could not find the Company guilty of an unfair labor practice unless it had refused to bargain with the representative of an appropriate unit, which in turn required the Board to find from relevant evidence which it was required to hear whether the employees of the Crystal City plant constituted such a unit. In making that determination the Board considered, as it could under  9(d), the certification proceeding, but it was not required to and did not confine its consideration to \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 173]\n\u00a0\n that proceeding. It heard evidence by numerous witnesses bearing on the question of the appropriate unit. It was bound to receive and consider all the evidence relevant to that issue, which was whether the policies of the Act would be better effectuated and whether the right of all of the Company's employees to self-organization would be fully secured by certifying a unit comprising all the employees of the six plants, or two units, one composed of the Crystal City employees and the other the employees in the five plants where the Federation admittedly had a majority.\n The Board has always hitherto weighed the desires of the employees in determining the appropriate unit. And here the Board concedes that the Crys al City employees strongly preferred to be represented by the Union. In refusing to attribute any weight to this fact the Board found that their choice was not free since it considered, that the Union because of the consent order, was company dominated. Whether the Union and the employees were in fact dominated by the employer, and the nature of the bargaining relations with the employer, were thus crucial issues in the case to be determined on evidence. And we are confronted with the extraordinary fact that the Board has determined those issues without ever having heard any evidence on the subject either in the present or the two earlier proceedings.\n The present wishes of the employees, their freedom in self- organization from the domination and interference of the employer, their past bargaining relations with the employer, were all admittedly relevant considerations. Even though the Board could have refused to hear the evevidence offered as to th wishes of the Crystal City employees and as to the prior bargaining history there, on the ground that, if true, the greater effectiveness of employee bargaining through a division-wide representative and the common interests of the em- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 174]\n\u00a0\n ployees in the six plants warranted the selection of the employees in the six plants as the appropriate unit, it did not attempt to do so. Instead, it rejected the evidence proffered by the Union not on technical or procedural grounds, nor because it thought these circumstances immaterial, or insufficient to change its determination, but on the sole ground that the Union was company dominated and 'had ceased to function' by reason of the Board's order directing the Company not to bargain with it. It did this without having found in the present or in either of the earlier proceedings that the Union had ever been dominated or interfered with by the Company, and without having made any order running against the Union or purporting to bind it. The position of the Board thus seems to be that the right of the Crystal City employees to act as a unit, and the right of the Union to represent them in proceedings for ascertaining the appropriate bargaining unit, and in collective bargaining with the employer were forever foreclosed in a proceeding in which they were not represented, to which the Union was not a party, in which no evidence was received or finding made of any unfair labor practice, and which resulted only in an order on consent of the employer which did not purport to control the Crystal City employees or the Union, or determine their rights.\n The only support which the opinion of the Court affords for a result so extraordinary is an intimation that the Crystal City employees and the Union had forfeited their right to have the proffered evidence considered by the Board because the Union had failed to intervene in the first proceeding in which the Board made its consent order against the Company, and because in the opinion of the Court the excluded evidence, if considered, would not have materially affected the outcome. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 175]\n\u00a0\n As the opinion of the Court itself points out, the first order of the Board did not run against or purport to bind the Union, see National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307; and as this Court has decided the Board is without authority under the provisions of the Act to say nothing of constitutional limitations, to make any order determining the rights of a labor organization in a proceeding to which it is not made a party. It was because the Board purported thus to determine the rights of an absent party which had failed to intervene, that we modified its order in National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 367 S., 60 S.Ct. 569, 576, 578. It is new doctrine in the law, that one who is not a necessary party to a proceeding in which no order is made against him, nevertheless in some way and on some undisclosed theory, forfeits his rights if he does not voluntarily become a party. At the present term of Court we have had occasion to reaffirm the long recognized principle that a judgment of a court which purports to bind parties not present or represented in the litigation is without efficacy to bind them because if given such effect the judgment would be a denial of due process. Hansberry v. Lee, \n311 \nU.S. 32\n, 61 S.Ct. 115. The order of an administrative board can have no greater force.\n There is no provision of the statute providing for notice or other procedure on the basis of which the rights of absent parties are to be foreclosed, and in the present case it does not even appear that the Union or the Crystal City employees were notified or were otherwise aware of the proceeding in which the order was made on consent of the employer, which it is now asserted operated to terminate the existence of the Union and for that reason forfeited its right and the right of the employees to have relevant evidence considered in a representation proceeding. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 176]\n\u00a0\n The suggestion that an appropriate hearing upon evidence may be dispensed with because the rejected evidence would not have materially affected the outcome, seems to be based either on the assumption that the Board has in some way passed on the weight of the rejected evidence without hearing it, or that the Court is now free to appraise it and perform the function which the Board neglected to perform. Neither position is tenable. The Board refused to consider any of the proffered evidence on the sole and erroneous ground that the Union and the Crystal City employees had lost the status which they otherwise would have had entitling them to have their wishes and their relations with the employer considered in a representation proceeding. We have no warrant for saying that the Board would have attributed less weight to these factors than to others favorable to the Federation which it did consider, or that if it had thought that it was free to consider them the outcome would have been the same, or that in any case, on review of the Board's order, the interested parties would not have been entitled to urge that the Board, upon consideration of all the evidence, had not properly exercised its discretion.\n As we are often reminded most of the decisions of the Board involve discretion which is to be exercised by it alone and not the courts. For that reason the only substantial right of the litigant before the Board is, in most cases, the right to invoke the exercise of that discretion upon a full and fair consideration of all the relevant evidence. That right the Board has denied to petitioners in this case by refusing to consider the evidence upon palpably erroneous grounds. We are no more free in this case to pass upon the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, with the details of which, like the Board, we are unacquainted, than in any other case in which the Board is required to receive and pass upon evidence. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 146, 177]\n\u00a0\n One of the most important safeguards of the rights of litigants and the minimal constitutional requirement, in proceedings before an administrative agency vested with discretion is that it cannot rightly exclude from consideration, facts and circumstances relevant to its inquiry which upon due consideration may be of persuasive weight in the exercise of its discretion.

The Board of Tax Appeals held that the value of the gifts was their cash-surrender value. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 1 Cir., 115 F.2d 209. That judgment must be affirmed on the authority of Guggenheim v. Rasquin, supra, unless as claimed by petitioner the court below was precluded from substituting its judgment of value for that of the Board. Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 55 S. Ct. 732, 736. But the question of what criterion should be employed for determining the 'value' of the gifts is a question of law. See Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573\n, 49 S.Ct. 426, 61 A.L.R. 906. Accordingly, the Circuit Court of Appeals was justified in reversing the decision of the Board as 'not in accordance with law'.

Daniel C. Rogers and James H. Linton, both of Jefferson City, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Kenneth Teasdale, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The issues in this case revolve around the power of a federal District Court to assess damages allegedly caused by a temporary injunction issued by the court but later dissolved on final hearing. These issues grow out of this situation: Respondents in this Court, seventy-six \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 623]\n\u00a0\n individuals, partnerships, and corporations operating trucks as common carriers in interstate commerce, filed a bill in the federal District Court to enjoin petitioners here, Missouri officials and agencies, from enforcing against them certain allegedly unconstitutional tax and license features of the Missouri Bus and Truck Law. 1 A single district judge granted a temporary restraining order under which respondents were required to post injunction bonds and under which the contested fees were to be deposited with a trustee during the litigation. But because the bill sought to restrain state officials from enforcing an allegedly unconstitutional state statute, the case was set down for hearing before a three judge District Court pursuant to section 266 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. Petitioners, in their answer to respondents' complaint, counterclaimed for fees and licenses the respondents had failed to pay in the past2 and later amended the counterclaim to include amounts the respondents failed to deposit with the trustee during the litigation. Ultimately, the three judge court found the Bus and Truck Law constitutional, 23 F.Supp. 865, dissolved the restraining order, dismissed the truck operators' bill, and also ordered the counterclaim dismissed without prejudice because of 'serious doubt as to the right of the de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 624]\n\u00a0\n fendants to maintain' such an action. The truck operators did not appeal from the dismissal of their bill. Petitioners' attempt to bring the dismissal of their counterclaim here by direct appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n306 \nU.S. 204\n, 59 S.Ct. 480. Thereupon the petitioners, on their own behalf and 'in behalf of the State of Missouri and of the State Treasurer', filed in the three judge court a motion for assessment of damages and costs against the truck operators and their injunction bond sureties. That court denied the requested relief on the ground that the questions presented by the motion for damages had been ruled upon and finally determined by the judgment dismissing the original counterclaim. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 3 but on a different ground. It held that the motion to assess damages involved issues ancillary to the original litigation, which would require a long and complicated inquiry; that such litigation is not the type for which a three judge court is provided; that the three judge court, however, did have jurisdiction to consider the motion if it saw fit, or to remit it to the single district judge; and that the action actually taken by the three judge court was final, since under the circumstances that court had not abused its discretion. We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 642\n, 61 S.Ct. 392, 85 L.Ed. --, primarily because of the procedural importance of determining the statutory function of a three judge court in dealing with questions such as those here presented. The case as presented to us requires that we give consideration to these questions:\n\n 1. \nShould the two additional judges, called to assist the district judge pursuant to section 266, have participated in consideration of the motion to assess damages?\n\n 2. \nWas the District Court correct in holding that its prior denial of the counterclaim was a final adjudication \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 625]\n\u00a0\n of the issues presented by petitioners' motion to assess damages?\n\n 3. \nWere the enjoined Missouri officials and agencies, to whom the injunction bonds ran, proper parties to invoke the court's action for assessment of damages?\n\n 4. \nDid the District Court erroneously exercise its discretionary power, by its refusal to hear and determine the merits of petitioners' motion to assess damages?\n First. We are of opinion that the two judges called in under section 266 to assist the district judge in passing upon the application for injunction should not have participated in consideration of the motion to assess damages. The limited statutory duties of the specially constituted three judge District Court had been fully performed before the motion for assessment of damages was filed. For section 266 of the Judicial Code provides for a hearing by three judges, instead of one district judge, only in connection with adjudication of a very narrow type of controversy- applications for temporary and permanent injunctions restraining state officials from enforcing state laws or orders made pursuant thereto upon the ground that the state statutes are repugnant to the federal Constitution. \n4\n The motion for damages raised questions not within the statutory purpose for which the two additional judges had been called. Those questions were therefore for the consideration of the District Court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction, and the three judge requirement of section 266 had no application. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 626]\n\u00a0\n But the fact that it was mistakenly assumed that the motion should be passed upon by the district judge in association with the two judges previously called did not of itself invalidate the District Court's judgment dismissing the motion. Though that judgment of dismissal was not appealable directly to this court under section 266, even though participated in by three judges,6 it was reviewable by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and since it has been so reviewed, the issues presented are properly before us.\n Second. The ground assigned by the District Court for denying the motion to assess damages was that by its previous dismissal of petitioners' counterclaim it had already ruled upon and finally determined the questions raised by the motion. The original counterclaim, however, was dismissed without a hearing on the merits. No evidence was heard. It was dismissed, as the court said at the time, because of 'serious doubt as to the right of the defendants to maintain such counterclaim', and in the order of dismissal it was specified that the action taken was 'without prejudice to the right of the defendants ... to maintain an independent action or suit thereon.' We need not here point out the procedural reasons which might have caused the 'serious doubt' which prompted the court to dismiss the counterclaim. For even assuming that the court properly dismissed the counterclaim without a hearing on the merits, it does not follow that its dismissal was a final adjudication of either the procedural or the substantive right of petitioners to invoke the court's jurisdiction by a motion to assess damages. Some of the damages asserted in the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 627]\n\u00a0\n motion-such as the costs of the litigation-were not asserted in the counterclaim, and such damages could not well have been determined until after final adjudication of the issues which caused the three judge court to be invoked. The record shows that action on the counterclaim was deferred pending full hearing on the constitutionality of the Missouri statute under attack. This postponement might well be attributed to a belief on the part of the court that the questions raised by the counterclaim were matters which could be better determined after final determination of the issues presented by the original bill for injunction. The judgment dismissing the motion for assessment of damages cannot be supported upon the ground that the issues raised by it had been adjudicated in the prior dismissal of the counterclaim.\n Third. Respondents also seek to support the court's judgment upon the ground that the enjoined state officials and agencies are not the proper parties to invoke the court's action for assessment of damages brought about by the injunction. This claim cannot be sustained. The argument on which it rests is that the State Treasurer, not the Public Service Commission, is given statutory power to collect the fees that are in part the basis of the motion to assess damages. But petitioners insist that the Public Service Commission actually collects the fees under customs and rules of long standing, and urges that statutory authority exists for such action by the Commission. But whoever has the statutory authority to collect fees, it is not denied that the Missouri Attorney General, one of the enjoined and petitioning officials, is given exclusive authority to bring suit in the name of and on behalf of the state. 7 And if \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 628]\n\u00a0\n upon a hearing damages are shown to have been suffered within the terms and conditions of the injunction bonds, the District Court sitting in equity has ample power to see that whatever sums are recovered go to the proper state officials. In addition to this, respondents are in a poor position to argue that petitioners are not proper parties, for one of the grounds upon which the respondents claimed an injunction against these particular petitioners was that it was they who were threatening to bring actions against respondents to collect the very fees which are now a part of the present motion for assessment of damages. At the instance of the operators, these state officials were for a period of fifteen months deprived of all opportunity to collect any fees except those deposited with the trustees pursuant to the terms of the restraining order. Petitioners' motion alleges that many operators failed to comply with the conditions imposed by the order, and that the state has been deprived of fees that it would have collected but for the injunction. The respondents did not bring their suit nor press their claim upon the assumption that these officials could not and would not protect the interest of the state. On the contrary, they acted upon a directly opposite premise and executed bonds running to the enjoined officials in which they agreed to pay the damages suffered. It is obvious, and was obvious from the beginning, that the main damages would be suffered by the State of Missouri and not by these petitioners as individuals. It was to protect the state through its officials that the bonds were required. In making this requirement the court acted in harmony with the governing principle 'that it is the duty of a court of equity granting injunctive relief to do so upon conditions that will protect all-including the public-whose interests the injunction may affect.' Inland Steel Co. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 153, 157\n, 59 S.Ct. 415, 417. Petitioners were proper parties to invoke the court's \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 629]\n\u00a0\n protection of the state's interest, and we have no doubt but that the court can mould any decree it renders so as to safeguard the rights of all interested parties.\n Fourth. There yet remains the basis upon which the court below affirmed the District Court's refusal to assess damages-that the jurisdiction to exercise this power is discretionary, and that refusal to exercise the power was not shown to be erroneous. In considering this question, it is of no importance that dealing with petitioners' motion for assessment of damages would involve long and complicated hearings on issues inappropriate for decision by a three judge court. For as we have pointed out, the issues were appropriate for decision by the single judge of the district. There can be no question of that judge's right to deal with issues such as those here presented. Under long settled equity practice, courts of chancery have discretionary power to assess damages sustained by parties who have been injured because of an injunctive restraint ultimately determined to have been improperly granted. Russell v. Farley, \n105 \nU.S. 433\n, 444 et seq.; Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co., \n243 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 37 S.Ct. 283, 286, Ann. Cas.1918C, 1147. This power is, as stated, discretionary; there are of course cases where the Chancellor might properly conclude that parties should be remitted to an action at law. But this is not one of those cases. If petitioners had to bring actions at law, each of the seventy-six respondents might have to be made a defendant in a separate action. There is a controversy between the parties as to whether or not all of these respondents could be sued or served in the State of Missouri; to be compelled to sue some of them elsewhere would work a hardship on the state. In addition to this, part of the damages for which petitioners seek recovery is made up of various items of cost and expense incurred in the litigation; if petitioners succeed on the merits, there might conceivably be serious problems raised by the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 621, 630]\n\u00a0\n seventy-six respondents as to the portion of damages fairly attributable to each-a problem peculiarly appropriate to equity, and preeminently adapted to settlement by a single court. Here, respondents joined themselves together in order jointly to restrain petitioners; they executed joint bonds; and they invoked the action of equity which has traditionally exerted its power not merely to assess damages caused by improvident injunctions but also to prevent the harmful consequences of an unnecessary multiplicity of causes of action. The circumstances of this case call so strongly for an assessment by equity that we think the court erred in dismissing the motion for assessment of damages. And it is especially fitting that equity exert its full strength in order to protect from loss a state which has been injured by reason of a suspension of enforcement of state laws imposed by equity itself. \n8\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings before a single district judge in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mo.Rev.Stats.

PULLMAN CO.(1941)\nNo. 283\nArgued: February 4, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Texas. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Cecil A. Morgan, of Fort Worth, Tex., for appellants, Cunningham et al.\n Mr. Cecil C. Rotsch, of Fort Worth, Tex., for appellants, Railroad Commission of Texas et al.\n Mr. Ireland Graves, of Austin, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In those sections of Texas where the local passenger traffic is slight, trains carry but one sleeping car. These trains, unlike trains having two or more sleepers, are without a Pullman conductor; the sleeper is in charge of a porter who is subject to the train conductor's control. As is well known, porters on Pullmans are colored and conductors are white. Addressing itself to this situation, the Texas Railroad Commission after due hearing ordered that 'no sleeping car shall be operated on any line of railroad in the State of Texas ... unless such \n\n[312 \nU.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n cars are continuously in the charge of an employee ... having the rank and position of Pullman conductor'. Thereupon, the Pullman Company and the railroads affected brought this action in a federal district court to enjoin the Commission's order. Pullman porters were permitted to intervene as complainants, and Pullman conductors entered the litigation in support of the order. Three judges having been convened, Judicial Code,  266, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, the court enjoined enforcement of the order. From this decree, the case came here directly. Judicial Code,  238, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n The Pullman Company and the reilroads assailed the order as unauthorized by Texas law as well as violative of the Equal Protection, the Due Process and the Commerce Clauses of the Constitution. The intervening porters adopted these objections but mainly objected to the order as a discrimination against Negroes in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The complaint of the Pullman porters undoubtedly tendered a substantial constitutional issue. It is more than substantial. It touches a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open. Such constitutional adjudication plainly can be avoided if a definitive ruling on the state issue would terminate the controversy. It is therefore our duty to turn to a consideration of questions under Texas law.\n The Commission found justification for its order in a Texas statute which we quote in the margin. \n1\n It is com- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n mon ground that if the order is within the Commission's authority its subject matter must be included in the Commission's power to prevent 'unjust discrimination ... and to prevent any and all other abuses' in the conduct of railroads. Whether arrangements pertaining to the staffs of Pullman cars are covered by the Texas concept of 'discrimination' is far from clear. What practices of the railroads may be deemed to be 'abuses' subject to the Commission's correction is equally doubtful. Reading the Texas statutes and the Texas decisions as outsiders without special competence in Texas law, we would have little confidence in our independent judgment regarding the application of that law to the present situation. The lower court did deny that the Texas statutes sustained the Commission's assertion of power. And this represents the view of an able and experienced circuit judge of the circuit which includes Texas and of two capable district judges trained in Texas law. Had we or they no choice in the matter but to decide what is the law of the state, we should hesitate long before rejecting their forecast of Texas law. But no matter how seasoned the judgment of the district court may be, it cannot escape being a forecast rather than a determination. The last word on the meaning of Article 6445 of the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n Texas Civil Statutes, and therefore the last word on the statutory authority of the Railroad Commission in this case, belongs neither to us nor to the district court but to the supreme court of Texas. In this situation a federal court of equity is asked to decide an issue by making a tentative answer which may be displaced tomorrow by a state adjudication. Glenn v. Field Packing Co., \n290 \nU.S. 177\n, 54 S.Ct. 138; Lee v. Bickell, \n292 \nU.S. 415\n, 54 S.Ct. 727. The reign of law is hardly promoted if an unnecessary ruling of a federal court is thus supplanted by a controlling decision of a state court. The resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.\n An appeal to the chancellor, as we had occasion to recall only the other day, is an appeal to the 'exercise of the sound discretion, which guides the determination of courts of equity'. Beal v. Missouri Pacific R. R., \n312 \nU.S. 45\n, 61 S.Ct. 418, 421, 85 L.Ed. --, decided January 20, 1941. The history of equity jurisdiction is the history of regard for public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of the injunction. There have been as many and as variegated applications of this supple principle as the situations that have brought it into play. See, for modern instances, Beasley v. Texas & Pacific Ry., \n191 \nU.S. 492\n, 24 S.Ct. 164; Harrisonville v. Dickey Clay Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334\n, 53 S.Ct. 602; United States v. Dern, \n289 \nU.S. 352\n, 53 S.Ct. 614. Few public interests have a higher claim upon the discretion of a federal chancellor than the avoidance of needless friction with state policies, whether the policy relates to the enforcement of the criminal law, Fenner v. Boykin, \n271 \nU.S. 240\n, 46 S.Ct. 492; Spielman Motor Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89\n, 55 S.Ct. 678; or the administration of a specialized scheme for liquidating embarrassed business enterprises, Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 96 A.L.R. 1166; or the final authority of a state court to interpret doubtful regulatory laws of the state, Gilchrist v. Interborough Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159\n, 49 S.Ct. 282; \n\n[312 \nU.S. 496, 501]\n\u00a0\n cf. Hawks v. Hamill, \n288 \nU.S. 52, 61\n, 53 S.Ct. 240, 243. These cases reflect a doctrine of abstention appropriate to our federal system whereby the federal courts, 'exercising a wise discretion', restrain their authority because of 'scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of the state governments' and for the smooth working of the federal judiciary. See Cavanaugh v. Looney, \n248 \nU.S. 453, 457\n, 39 S.Ct. 142, 143; Di Giovanni v. Camden Ins. Ass'n, \n296 \nU.S. 64, 73\n, 56 S.Ct. 1, 5. This use of equitable powers is a contribution of the courts in furthering the harmonious relation between state and federal authority without the need of rigorous congressional restriction of those powers. Compare 37 Stat. 1013, 28 U.S.C.A.  380; Judicial Code,  24(1), as amended, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1); 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.  101-115, 29 U.S.C.A.  101-115.\n Regard for these important considerations of policy in the administration of federal equity jurisdiction is decisive here. If there was no warrant in state law for the Commission's assumption of authority there is an end of the litigation; the constitutional issue does not arise. The law of Texas appears to furnish easy and ample means for determining the Commission's authority. Article 6453 of the Texas Civil Statutes gives a review of such an order in the state courts. Or, if there are difficulties in the way of this procedure of which we have not been apprised, the issue of state law may be settled by appropriate action on the part of the State to enforce obedience to the order. Beal v. Missouri Pacific R.R., supra; Article 6476, Texas Civil Statutes. In the absence of any showing that these obvious methods for securing a definitive ruling in the state courts cannot be pursued with full protection of the constitutional claim, the district court should exercise its wise discretion by staying its hands. Compare Thompson v. Magnolia Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478\n, 60 S.Ct. 628.\n We therefore remand the cause to the district court, with directions to retain the bill pending a determination \n\n[312 \nU.S. 496, 502]\n\u00a0\n of proceedings, to be brought with reasonable promptness, in the state court in conformity with this opinion.

The enforcement of this order was enjoined by lower federal courts at the suit of the complainant in the present case, Rowan & Nichols Oil Company, D.C., 28 F.Supp. 131; 5 Cir., 107 F.2d 70. To avoid the dislocation resulting from this judicial frustration of its order, the Commission, by an order of September 11, 1939, had to devise a new plan of proration. Its action in doing so was again promptly challenged in a federal district court in Texas. A decree enjoining the Commission followed, and an appeal from that decree is the matter now before us. Judicial Code,  238, 266, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, 380.\n The challenged order of the Commission concededly satisfies all procedural requirements. It was part of a continuous process of administrative responsibility, preceded by a specific hearing affecting the immediate situation, with full opportunity given to the Oil Company to develop the facts and arguments which it later renewed below and here.\n The Commission's action now in controversy cannot be severed from the earlier order which it replaced. Both set limits, incontestably valid, Champlin Rfg. Co. v. Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210\n, 52 S.Ct. 559, 86 A.L.R. 403, on the daily production of the East Texas field. In both litigations the Oil Company claimed to be a victim of illegalities in the method of distributing this total allowable production among the different classes of oil producers.\n So far as relief in the federal courts is concerned, we found in the prior phase of this continuing litigation that the order of the Commission was without infirmity. \n310 \nU.S. 573\n, 60 S.Ct. 1021, 1023; \n311 \nU.S. 614\n, 61 S.Ct. 66, 85 L.Ed. --. In the order which was then before us each well was allowed 2.32 per cent of its hourly potential production, except that wells not capable of producing 20 barrels a day at open flow were, in conformity with the Marginal Well Statute (Vernon's Texas Annotated Civil Statutes, art. 6049b), allowed full capacity, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 570, 573]\n\u00a0\n and wells which could not produce over 20 barrels a day at 2.32 per cent of their hourly potential were allowed 20 barrels a day. The order distributed, in round numbers, a total allowable of 522,000 barrels as follows: 5,250 a day to 451 wells having a capacity of less than 20 barrels; 380,640 to 19,032 wells which at 2.32 per cent of hourly potential could not produce over 20 barrels; 136,610 to 6,325 wells at the rate of 2.32 per cent of hourly potential. This adjustment by the state's expert agency of what in our former opinion we called 'as thorny a problem as has challenged the ingenuity and wisdom of legislatures' was attacked on two grounds. It was claimed that an hourly potential formula fatally omitted other relevant factors, especially acre-feet of sand. Further it was urged that the minimum allowance of 20 barrels, which nearly absorbed the total production, constituted an illegitimate discrimination against highproducing and thinly drilled areas. We rejected these arguments as an attempt to substitute a judicial judgment for the expert process invented by the state in a field so peculiarly dependent on specialized judgment. We said in effect that the basis of present knowledge touching proration was so uncertain and developing, that sounder foundations are only to be achieved through the fruitful empiricism of a continuous administrative process. Further, that ought not to be stifled by drawing from the generalities of the Constitution allegiance to one as against another speculative assumption even though delusively clothed in formal findings of fact.\n In the order now before us the Commission allowed a total production of 691,000 barrels, and the formula of allocation took into consideration two other factors-bottomhole pressure and the quality of the surrounding sand of the wells-as well as hourly potential. By this formula 514 wells incapable of producing 20 barrels a day at open flow absorbed 6,245 barrels, 25,456 wells were \n\n[311 \nU.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n allotted a minimum of 20 barrels, thus absorbing 509,000 barrels, leaving 176,000 barrels to be distributed among these latter wells according to the new allocation formula. Under the first order the minimum per well allowance of 20 barrels accounted for 98 per cent of the limited production; under the later order only 75 per cent was needed to satisfy the 20 barrel allowance. The lease involved in this litigation was allowed by the first order an output of 154 barrels a day, or .029 per cent of the total allowable; now it may produce 260 barrels a day, which is .037 per cent of the total. This comparison of the practical operation of the two orders exposes the emptiness of the claim that a constitutional line can be drawn between them.\n The accommodation of conflicting private interests in the East Texas oil field, with due regard to the public welfare, is beset with perplexities, both geological and economic. As we read the records in these cases, this picture emerges. The huge oil resources of that region, viewed in cross-section from east to west, are roughly triangular in shape. On the lower western side the pressure of an oilwater face furnishes the principal energy of the field. As the oil is withdrawn, the pressure is decreased. The drive of the water from the west forces the oil eastward, and the westernmost wells are first exhausted. The reduced pressure in the field shortens the life of the wells on the extreme eastern edge, with the result that the wells nearer the center of the field, like those of the Rowan & Nichols Company, are likely to be most long-lived. Thus it is that a production formula dependent on current reserves of oil in place-a consideration which greatly influenced the court below and was urged before us-contains elements of unfairness to wells on the edge of the field by disregarding the migration of oil from west to east. Other factors further complicate the situation. The surface is often divided into \n\n[311 \nU.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n small tracts, and the Commission, acting under the authority of the Texas statutes, has permitted the drilling of wells by small owners in order to prevent practical forfeiture of their interests. Small producers have investments in existing wells with low capacities, and these wells need a minimum daily production sufficient to justify their enterprise. In addition to all this, any scheme of proration duly mindful of all those considerations, hardly mathematically commensurable, which constitute the total well-being of a society, must assure the continued operation of a sufficient number of wells for an adequate exploitation of the state's oil resources.\n In achieving a reconciliation of these tangled and partly conflicting aims, the Commission evidently regarded the 20-barrel minimum allowance as a guiding factor, taking its cue doubtless in part from the policy underlying the Texas Marginal Well Statute, supra. The justification for the Commission's order was its conviction that the minimum allowance accelerates the rate of production of the densely drilled areas on the edges of the field most subject to losses from the migration of the oil, that such allowance is an appropriate incentive to the drilling of small tracts, and that thereby investment losses in lowproducing wells are minimized.\n Nothing in the Constitution warrants a rejection of these expert conclusions. Nor, on the basis of intrinsic skills and equipment, are the federal courts qualified to set their independent judgment on such matters against that of the chosen state authorities. For its own good reasons Texas vested authority over these difficult and delicate problems in its Railroad Commission. Presumably that Body, as the permanent representative of the state's regulatory relation to the oil industry equipped to deal with its ever-changing aspects, possesses an insight and aptitude which can hardly be matched by judges who are called upon to intervene at fitful intervals. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n Indeed, we are asked to sustain the district court's decree as though it derived from an ordinary litigation that had its origin in that court, and as though Texas had not an expert Commission which already had canvassed and determined the very issues on which the court formed its own judgment. For it appears that the court below nullified the Commission's action without even having the record of the Commission before it. When we consider the limiting conditions of litigation-the adaptability of the judicial process only to issues definitely circumscribed and susceptible of being judged by the techniques and criteria within the special competence of lawyers-it is clear that the Due Process Clause does not require the feel of the expert to be supplanted by an independent view of judges on the conflicting testimony and prophecies and impressions of expert witnesses.\n This record gives little justification for confidence in such testimony as the basis for judicial dogmatism. Take, for instance, the question of the amount of recoverable oil remaining in the field. One expert testifying for the Company in this case gave an estimate of 3,180, 000,000 barrels, while in another case a year previously his estimate had been a billion barrels less. Similarly, in regard to the crucial issue of the 20-barrel minimum, although it was common ground that some minimum was essential to avoid fatal losses of investment, what that minimum should be was clearly not shown to be capable of mathematical ascertainment, and no expert on behalf of the Oil Company proved that the minimum of the Commission bore no relation to the legislative policy to be enforced by the Commission.\n The Constitution does not provide that the federal courts shall strike a balance between ascertainable facts and dubious inferences underlying such a complicated and elusive situation as is presented by the Texas oil fields in order to substitute the court's wisdom for that \n\n[311 \nU.S. 570, 577]\n\u00a0\n of the legislative body. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582\n, 49 S.Ct. 430. The real answer to any claims of inequity or to any need of adjustment to shifting circumstances is the continuing supervisory power of the expert commission. In any event, a state's interest in the conservation and exploitation of a primary natural resource is not to be achieved through assumption by the federal courts of powers plainly outside their province and no less plainly beyond their special competence. The Fourteenth Amendment was not intended for such ends.\n The court below also erred in holding the order a violation of the Texas statute requiring proration on a 'reasonable basis'. Vernon's Texas Annotated Civil Statutes art. 6049c,  7. In denying the petition for rehearing in the earlier cases we held that whatever rights the state statute may afford are to be pursued in the state courts, \n311 \nU.S. 614\n, 61 S.Ct. 66, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The decree is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for dismissal of the complaint. So ordered.\n Decree vacated and case remanded.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion in Railroad Commission of Texas v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 573\n, 60 S.Ct. 1021. They are of opinion that the facts disclosed by the record do not differ materially from those found in the earlier case and require the affirmance of the judgment. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAWLINGS v. RAY(1941)\nNo. 327\nArgued: Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Earl King, of Memphis, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is the receiver of the Lee County National Bank of Marianna, Arkansas, which in 1933 was declared by the Comptroller of the Currency to be insolvent. On November 6, 1935, the Comptroller assessed its shareholders fifty per centum of the par value of their shares. The assessment was required to be paid on or before December 13, 1935, and the receiver gave notice accordingly. As respondent failed to pay, the receiver brought suit on December 7, 1938, in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas to recover the amount assessed. Respondent pleaded the Arkansas statute of limitations which provides that such an action must be commenced 'within three years after the cause of action shall accrue'. Pope's Digest of Statutes of Arkansas ( 1937), Sec. 8928. The District Court sustained the plea and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Futrall v. Ray, 8 Cir., 111 F.2d 695. Because of a conflict of decisions we granted certiorari. See Strasburger v. Schram, 68 App.D.C. 87, 93 F.2d 246; Reich v. Van Dyke, 3 Cir., 107 F.2d 682; Haight v. First Trust & Deposit Co., 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 572; MacPherson v. Schram, 5 Cir., 112 F.2d 674.\n The state statute of limitations is applicable. McDonald v. Thompson, \n184 \nU.S. 71, 72\n, 22 S.Ct. 297; McClaine v. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n Rankin, \n197 \nU.S. 154, 158\n, 25 S.Ct. 410, 411, 3 Ann.Cas. 500. The question is whether the statute began to run on the date of the assessment, as held by the court below, or on the date fixed for payment. The words 'after the cause of action shall accrue' in the Arkansas statute have their usual meaning and refer to 'a complete and present cause of action'. Holloway v. Morris, 182 Ark. 1096, 1099, 34 S.W.2d 750, 752.\n The question as to the time when there was a complete and present cause of action so that the receiver could enforce by suit the liability imposed by the Comptroller's assessment is a federal question and turns upon the construction of the assessment and the authority of the Comptroller to make it under the applicable federal legislation.\n While the assessment was made on November 6, 1935, it was expressly made payable on or before December 13, 1935. Respondent was allowed until that date to pay and prior thereto suit could not be maintained against him. Hence the statute of limitations did not begin to run until December 13, 1935, and the suit was in time.\n The case of Pufahl v. Estate of Parks, \n299 \nU.S. 217\n, 57 S.Ct. 151 (upon which the court below relied) is not to the contrary. The question now presented was not there involved. In that case, after the death of a stockholder of a national bank, and after the expiration of one year from the date of letters testamentary, the Comptroller of the Currency made an assessment upon the decedent's estate. The state court, applying a state statute, had disallowed the receiver's claim upon the assessment as against undistributed assets in the hands of the executors, which had been inventoried within a year from the date of letters testamentary, because the claim did not accrue and was not presented to the probate court within that period, but allowed the claim as to assets not inventoried within the year. We affirmed the judgment. We said that where an assessment had been made in the de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n cedent's lifetime an accrued and provable debt existed against his estate, and that if the assessment were made after his death a claim against the funds and assets of the estate accrued as of the date of the assessment. Further, that the claim of the receiver, although based upon a federal statute, could be enforced only in conformity with the law of the forum governing the recovery of debts of like nature (Id., 299 U.S. at pages 224, 225, 57 S.Ct. at pages 155, 156) and that the non- discriminatory legislation of Illinois where the suit was brought was controlling. We observed that the contingent obligation of a stockholder to pay an assessment was rendered absolute by the Comptroller's action in ordering one and that from the moment of the order of assessment the receiver had a claim which would support an action at common law against a living stockholder or the executor of a deceased stockholder; that if the assessment were made after the estate had been distributed, the receiver could recover from the distributees or heirs if and up to the extent they were liable under the applicable local law. Id., 299 U.S. at pages 222, 223, 57 S.Ct. at pages 154, 155.\n In all this we were not considering or deciding the question of the application of a statute of limitations to a suit against a stockholder upon an assessment made by the Comptroller where payment was not required before a specified date, prior to which no suit could be maintained.\n We find no ground for questioning the authority of the Comptroller in making an assessment to fix a later date for its payment. The federal legislation does not impose or suggest any such limitation upon the exercise of his power. 12 U.S.C.  63, 64, 191, 192, 12 U.S.C.A.  63, 64, 191, 192. What was done in the instant case appears to be in accord with a practice of long standing.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORP. v.

See Federal Deposit \n\n[312 \nU.S. 81, 83]\n\u00a0\n Insurance Corporation v. Casaday, 10 Cir., 106 F.2d 784.\n Rule 54(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, provides that 'costs against the United States, its officers, and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law'. This provision was merely declaratory and effected no change of principle.\n The Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a corporate agency of the government, which is its sole stockholder. 47 Stat. 5, 15 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 15 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. It is managed by a board of directors appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Corporation has wide powers and conducts financial operations on a vast scale. While it acts as a governmental agency in performing its functions (see Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corporation, \n308 \nU.S. 21, 32\n, 33 S., 60 S.Ct. 15, 17, 18, 124 A.L.R. 1263), still its transactions are akin to those of private enterprises and the mere fact that it is an agency of the government does not extend to it the immunity of the sovereign. Sloan Shipyards v. United States Fleet Corporation, \n258 \nU.S. 549, 566\n, 567 S., 42 S.Ct. 386, 388. Congress has expressly provided that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall have power 'to sue and be sued, to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal'. There is nothing in the statutes governing its transactions which suggests any intention of Congress that in suing and being sued the Corporation should not be subject to the ordinary incident of unsuccessful litigation in being liable for the costs which might properly be awarded against a private party in a similar case.\n We have had recent occasion to consider the status, in relation to suits, of a regional corporation chartered by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and we have set forth the general principles which we think should govern in our approach to the particular question now presented. Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, 306 U.S. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 81, 84]\n\u00a0\n 381, 59 S.Ct. 516, 517. In the Keifer case we did not find it necessary to trace to its origin the doctrine of the exceptional freedom of the United States from legal responsibility, but we observed that 'because the doctrine gives the government a privileged position, it has been appropriately confined'. Hence, we declared that 'the government does not become the conduit of its immunity in suits against its agents or instrumentalities merely because they do its work'. Id., 306 U.S. page 388, 59 S.Ct. page 517. Recognizing that Congress may endow a governmental corporation with the government's immunity, we found the question to be 'Has it done so?' That is, immunity in the case of a governmental agency is not presumed. We sought evidence that Congress had intended that its creature, considering the purpose and scope of its powers, should have the immunity which the sovereign itself enjoyed, and we noted the practice of Congress as an indication 'of the present climate of opinion' which had brought governmental immunity from suit into disfavor. Accordingly, being unable to find that Congress had intended immunity from suit we denied it.\n It was with a similar approach that we decided in Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, \n309 \nU.S. 242\n, 62 S.Ct. 488, 490, that the Federal Housing Administration was subject to be garnished under state law for moneys due to an employee. There, the Administrator under the National Housing Act was authorized 'to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal'. 49 Stat. 722, 12 U.S.C.A.  1702. Starting from the premise indicated in the Keifer case that waivers by Congress of governmental immunity from suit should be liberally construed in the case of federal instrumentalities-that being in line with the current disfavor of the doctrine of governmental immunity-we concluded that in the absence of a contrary showing 'it must be presumed that when Congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial \n\n[312 \nU.S. 81, 85]\n\u00a0\n world and endowed it with authority to 'sue or be sued', that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be'. Following that reasoning, the precise point of the decision was that the words 'sue and be sued' normally embrace all civil process incident to the commencement or continuance of legal proceedings and hence embraced garnishment as part of that process.\n These decisions chart our course. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation is expressly authorized to sue and be sued. It has availed itself of that authority to bring the defendants into court to answer the charge of trade-mark infringement. The defendants have successfully resisted the charge and the question is whether they should be denied the usual incidents of their success. We apply the principle that there is no presumption that the agent is clothed with sovereign immunity. We look as in the Keifer and Burr cases to see whether Congress has endowed petitioner with that immunity and we find no indications whatever of such an intent. We apply the farther principle that the words 'sue and be sued' normally include the natural and appropriate incidents of legal proceedings. The payment of costs by the unsuccessful litigant, awarded by the court in the proper exercise of the authority it possesses in similar cases, is manifestly such an incident. The additional allowance made by courts of equity in accordance with sound equity practice is likewise such an incident. Sprague v. Ticonic Bank, \n307 \nU.S. 161\n, 59 S.Ct. 777. We perceive no reason for holding that petitioner may avail itself of the judicial process in accordance with the authority conferred upon it and escape the usual incidents of that process in case its assertions of right prove to be unfounded. On the contrary, we think that the unqualified authority to sue and be sued placed petitioner upon an equal footing with private parties as to the usual inci- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 81, 86]\n\u00a0\n dents of suits in relation to the payment of costs and allowances.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORP. v.

Prior to that decision the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had held that appeals from such orders (involving $500 or more) could be had as a matter of right. London v. O'Dougherty, 102 F.2d 524. Subsequent to the decision in the London case and prior to the decision of Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc. v. Cowan, supra, petitioners endeavored to take appeals from compensation orders, which had been entered in reorganization proceedings under former  77B, 48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, by filing within the appeal period provided by  25, sub. a, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  48, sub. a, notices of appeal in the District Court. No application for leave to appeal was made to the Circuit Court of Appeals at any time. Some of the appeals were argued in May, 1939, the balance in February, 1940, some of the notices of appeal having been filed in the District Court in March, 1939, and some in November, 1939. While the matter was under advisement in the Circuit Court of Appeals we decided Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc., v. Cowan, supra. Thereupon certain respondents moved for dismissal of the appeals for want of jurisdiction. All of the appeals were \n\n[311 \nU.S. 579, 581]\n\u00a0\n dismissed, some on those motions and some by the court sua sponte. In re Prudence-Bonds Corp., 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 37. The case is here on petition for certiorari which we granted in view of the importance of the procedural problem in administration of the Bankruptcy Act and of the asserted substantial conflict of the decision below with Baxter v. Savings Bank, 92 F.2d 404, and Wilson v. Alliance Life Ins. Co., 102 F.2d 365, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n Section 250 of the Chandler Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  650, provides that appeals from compensation orders 'may, in the manner and within the time provided for appeals by this Act (title), be taken to and allowed by the circuit court of Appeals.' Petitioners contends that when  250 states that such appeals may be taken 'in the manner ... provided for appeals by this Act (title),' it necessarily makes applicable  24, sub. b, 11 U.S. C.A.  47, sub. b, which provides that such appellate jurisdiction shall be exercised 'by appeal and in the form and manner of an appeal'. They argue, therefore, that Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, which allows an appeal to be taken 'by filing with the district court a notice of appeal' in those cases where an 'appeal is permitted by law from a district court to a circuit court of appeals', governs appeals under  250 as well as other appeals, since General Order No. 36, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53, makes those rules applicable to appeals in bankruptcy, 'except as otherwise provided in the Act'. In our view, however, Rule 73(a) is not applicable to appeals under  250 (see 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., p. 918) for they are permissive appeals which may be had not as of right but only in the discretion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Since  250 provides that they may 'be taken to and allowed by the circuit court of appeals', the proper procedure for taking them is by filing in the Circuit Court of Appeals, within the time prescribed in  25 sub. a, applications for leave to appeal, not by filing notices of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 579, 582]\n\u00a0\n appeal in the District Court as was done here. As respondents maintain, that is the fair implication from our conclusion in Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc. v. Cowan, supra, 309 U.S. at page 385, 60 S.Ct. page 597, that such appeals 'may be had only at the discretion of the Circuit Court of Appeals.' But while the appeals under  250 must be 'taken to' the Circuit Court of Appeals within the time prescribed in  25 sub. a we do not think it is the fair intendment of that section that they must also be 'allowed' within that time. Cf. In re Foster Const. Corp., 2 Cir., 49 F.2d 213; Price v. Spokane Silver & Lead Co., 8 Cir., 97 F.2d 237. If that were true, the existence of the right to appeal would be subject to contingencies which no degree of diligence by an appellant could control. Ambiguities in statutory language should not be resolved so as to imperil a substantial right which has been granted.\n The court below was in substantial agreement with the foregoing construction of  250. It went on to hold, however, that since petitioners did not seek an allowance of their appeals in that court within the time prescribed in  25, sub. a, it had no jurisdiction to allow them. We take a different view.\n The procedure followed by petitioners was irregular. Normally the Circuit Court of Appeals would be wholly justified in treating the mere filing of a notice of appeal in the District Court as insufficient. But the defect is not jurisdictional in the sense that it deprives the court of power to allow the appeal. The court has discretion, where the scope of review is not affected, to disregard such an irregularity in the interests of substantial justice. Cf. Taylor v. Voss, \n271 \nU.S. 176\n, 46 S.Ct. 461, dealing with appeals and petitions for revision under earlier provisions of the Act. In this case the effect of the procedural irregularity was not substantial. The scope of review was not altered. There was no question of the good faith of petitioners, of dilatory tactics, or of frivolous appeals. Hence it would be extremely harsh to hold that \n\n[311 \nU.S. 579, 583]\n\u00a0\n petitioners were deprived of their right to have the court exercise its discretion on the allowance of their appeals by reason of their erroneous reliance upon the permanency of London v. O'Dougherty, supra. This conclusion does not do violence to Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., \n301 \nU.S. 172\n, 57 S.Ct. 680. As we indicated in Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc., v. Cowan, supra, the Shulman case stated the rule of permissive appeals which was carried over into  250. The failure to comply with statutory requirements, however, is not necessarily a jurisdictional defect. Cf. Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Pillsbury, \n301 \nU.S. 174\n, 57 S.Ct. 682.\n For the reasons stated, we hold that the Circuit Court of Appeals had the power to allow the appeals.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED (concurring).\n I am of opinion that timely application to the circuit court of appeals for leave to appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and that the practice followed in this case cannot be reduced to a mere procedural irregularity. Farrar v. Churchill, \n135 \nU.S. 609, 612\n, 613 S., 10 S.Ct. 771, 772; Old Nick Williams Co. v. United States, \n215 \nU.S. 541\n, 30 S.Ct. 221; Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., \n301 \nU.S. 172\n, 57 S.Ct. 680. However, when petitioners filed their notices of appeal in the district court the proper procedure was not settled, and petitioners were misled by the decision of the court below in London v. O'Dougherty, 2 Cir., 102 F.2d 524. In these unique circumstances I think that reversal of the judgment is justified by our broad power to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S.Ct. 1, 2, 3 A.L.R. 323; Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan, \n311 \nU.S. 243\n, 61 S.Ct. 189, 196, decided December 9, 1940. In rare instances such as the case at bar this power is appropriate for curing even jurisdictional defects. Cf. Rorick v.

MEALEY(1941)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: November 10, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.\n Messrs. Harry A. Allan and Daniel H. Prior, both of Albany, N.Y., for appellant.\n Mr. Jack Goodman, of Albany, N.Y., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to restrain the appellee from enforcing a suspension of the appellant's driver's license. The complaint alleges that the order suspending the license was issued May 29, 1940, pursuant to  94-b of the Vehicle and Traffic Law of New York,1 upon receipt by the appellee from the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Albany County of a transcript of a judgment, accompanied by evidence of its finality and nonpayment, rendered against the appellant in the sum of $5,138.25, in an action to recover damages for personal injuries caused by appellant's operation of an automobile. It is alleged that on June 21, 1940, the appellant was adjudicated a bankrupt and his cause referred to a referee; that the judgment was scheduled as a debt; and although no discharge had been granted, the judgment is a dischargeable debt. The complaint charges that  94-b \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment and is rendered void by  17 of the bankruptcy act. \n2\n A temporary and a permanent injunction are prayed. A restraining order issued. The answer of the appellee admits all of the relevant allegations except that the judgment was dischargeable in bankruptcy. Upon the hearing of a motion for injunction based upon the bill and answer, a court of three judges denied the injunction and dismissed the bill. \n3\n At the argument before us it was admitted that a discharge has been granted and that the judgment debt is thereby discharged.\n Section 94-b provides for suspension of the operator's license and registration certificate of any person if a judgment against him for injury to person or property resulting from the operation of a motor car be not paid within fifteen days, upon certification of the judgment, its finality, and nonpayment, to the commissioner by the county clerk. It directs the commissioner to suspend the license for three years unless, in the meantime, the judgment is satisfied or discharged, except by a discharge in bankruptcy. The suspension persists after the expiration of the three years or satisfaction of the judgment, until the licensee gives proof of his ability to respond in damages by the procurement of insurance, the giving of a bond, or the posting of a deposit. \n4\n The county clerk is required to certify to the commissioner any such judgment unappealed and unsatisfied for fifteen days after entry.\n So the statute stood until May 4, 1936, when, by an amendatory act,5 a proviso was added that if the creditor consents in writing, the debtor may be allowed a license and registration for six months from the date of such consent and thereafter until the consent is revoked in \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n writing, if proof of ability to respond to damages is furnished. A further amendment of May 31, 1939,6 made it the duty of the county clerk to certify the judgment only upon written demand of the creditor or his attorney.\n The purpose of the statute is clear. It is not a condition of the grant of license that the applicant shall have insurance. Instead the policy of the State is that if a driver has an accident in respect of which a judgment convicts him of negligence his license will be suspended and so remain unless he furnishes proof of his ability to respond for damage thereafter caused; and that, in any event, it will be suspended for three years unless, in the meantime, the judgment is satisfied or the creditor consents that the license be reinstated and remain in force.\n First. The statute, leaving out of consideration the amendments, is not obnoxious to the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The use of the public highways by motor vehicles, with its consequent dangers, renders the reasonableness and necessity of regulation apparent. The universal practice is to register ownership of automobiles and to license their drivers. Any appropriate means adopted by the states to insure competence and care on the part of its licensees and to protect others using the highway is consonant with due process. Some states require insurance or its equivalent as a condition of the issue of a license. New York chose to obtain the same end by providing for the revocation or suspension of a license if the holder is adjudged guilty of negligent driving. Section 94-b permits the restoration of the license upon payment or satisfaction of the judgment. As the court below has held, the effect of the statute as it stood prior to the amendment of 1936 was to make the license privilege a form of protection against damage to the public inflicted through the licensee's carelessness. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n Second. Prior to the amendment of 1936, the license could not be restored until three years had expired from its suspension unless the judgment were paid or discharged, except by a discharge in bankruptcy, and unless, also, the licensee furnished proof of his ability to respond in damages for any future accident.\n If the statute went no further, we are clear that it would constitute a valid exercise of the state's police power not inconsistent with  17 of the bankruptcy act. The penalty which  94-b imposes for injury due to careless driving is not for the protection of the creditor merely but to enforce a public policy that irresponsible drivers shall not, with impunity, be allowed to injure their fellows. The scheme of the legislation would be frustrated if the reckless driver were permitted to escape its provisions by the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy, and, accordingly, the legislature declared that a discharge in bankruptcy should not interfere with the operation of the statute. Such legislation is not in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act. Rather it is an enforcement of permissible state policy touching highway safety.\n Third. The appellant insists that the section as amended, and as it was at the time the judgment was rendered against him, violates the due process clause and runs afoul of the bankruptcy act in virtue of the power given the creditor to have the judgment certified to the commissioner of motor vehicles, that is, the power to bring  94-b into operation, and the further power to suspend the operation of the section.\n The claim of deprivation of rights without due process of law is frivolous. The State has seen fit to give the plaintiff an additional means of enforcing the payment of a judgment for damages inflicted in the operation of a motor vehicle by dealing with the registration and license of the driver. The grant of this additional remedy is not inconsistent with the concept of due process. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n A more serious question arises in connection with  17 of the bankruptcy act. The discharge of the debtor is a defense available against a suit on the judgment and against execution process issued upon it. And there is force in the argument that  94-b, as amended, in truth deprives the debtor of the immunity afforded by his discharge, leaves out of view the public policy of the State or makes that public policy subservient to the private interest of the creditor by affording him the opportunity to initiate, remove and revive the suspension of the license upon terms as to payments on account of his claim.\n The District Court held that it need not consider the validity of the amendment of 1939 which requires the county clerk to certify the judgment only upon the request of the creditor. Under the old law it was the duty of the county clerk to certify every such judgment which had become final and remained unsatisfied for fifteen days. It is true that the bill alleges the judgment in this case was certified at the request of the plaintiff's attorney. But if the amendment is void because it confers a power on the creditor inconsistent with the effect of the debtor's discharge, and is eliminated from the statute for that reason, it still remains that under the old law the county clerk's duty to certify was mandatory, and this judgment would have been certified if he had performed his official duty.\n The court also found it unnecessary to pass upon the validity of the 1936 amendment. The power of the creditor to lift the suspension and restore it during the period of three years does not appear to have been invoked in the present case. If the creditor attempts to exercise that power the commissioner will have to determine whether the amendment giving the creditor such power is valid.\n The court was of the view that if the amendments are invalid as inconsistent with  17 of the bankruptcy act, they are severable, and that the statute may stand as a complete act without them, since, under the law of New \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n York, a statute in itself constitutional is not affected by an unconstitutional amendment;-the amendment dropping out and the original act remaining in force. Decisions of the highest court of the State are cited to this effect. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n These decisions hold that, where the original and amending acts were enacted by different legislatures, it cannot be thought that the original act would not have been retained except for the amendments, and this principle has been applied where the amending act declares, as it does in this instance, that the original act is 'amended to read as follows' and then contains a redraft of the entire act with the amendment inserted. Whether an amendment stands by itself as an independent enactment, or is incorporated in the setting of the act which it amends, by a provision that the act 'shall read as follows:' is a matter of draftsmanship or legislative mechanics. It does not touch the substance of constitutionality.\n There is no evidence of intent that if the amendments could not stand the legislation as a whole should fail. On the contrary, the legislative history discloses a persistent purpose that such a scheme for the control of motor drivers should remain. Successive and frequent amendments have dealt with details but have left intact the major features of the legislation. \n9\n In any case, we should accord great weight to the District Court's view of New York law. But an examination of the authorities convinces that in this case any contrary view is untenable. Since the judgment in this case would or should have been \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 40]\n\u00a0\n certified prior to the amendment of 1939 and since the creditor has not sought to invoke the amendment of 1936 which gives him a control over the restoration of appellant's license and its continued force during the three year suspension period, we think the court was right in abstaining from deciding whether the amendments are annulled by  17 of the bankruptcy act.\n The decree is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n Under the statute in question it becomes the duty of the commissioner of motor vehicles to suspend the operator's license of one against whom the unsatisfied judgment has been rendered (Matter of Jones v. Harnett, 247 App.Div. 7, 286 N.Y.S. 220, affirmed 271 N.Y. 626, 3 N.E.2d 455) 'upon receiving a certified copy' of such final judgment from the court. McKinney's Consol.Laws, Bk. 62-A,  94-b. The statute further provides that 'It shall be the duty of the clerk of the court, or of the court, where it has no clerk, in which any such judgment is rendered, to forward immediately, upon written demand of the judgment creditor or his attorney ... to such commissioner a certified copy of such judgment or a transcript thereof.' (Italics supplied.) Id.\n In this case the judgment creditor invoked the power which the New York legislature placed in his hands. At the request of his attorney the clerk of the court forwarded a transcript of the judgment to the commissioner who thereupon issued the order of suspension.\n The power thus granted the judgment creditor contravenes  17 of the Bankruptcy Act. Judgments on claims of the kind involved here1 are provable (Lewis v. Roberts, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 41]\n\u00a0\n \n267 \nU.S. 467\n, 45 S.Ct. 357, 37 A.L.R. 1440) and do not fall within any of the categories of debts excepted from discharge by  17. Since they are dischargeable, a state cannot supply a device for their collection which survives a discharge in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy power is 'unrestricted and paramount'; the states 'may not pass or enforce laws to interfere with or complement the Bankruptcy Act or to provide additional or auxiliary regulations.' International Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261, 265\n, 49 S.Ct. 108, 110. The power which New York has placed in the hands of this judgment creditor is such an interference, though the discharge in bankruptcy be deemed to destroy only the remedy (Zavelo v. Reeves, \n227 \nU.S. 625\n, 33 S.Ct. 365, Ann.Cas.1914D, 664) not the debt.\n Under the New York scheme a creditor whose claim has been discharged still holds a club over his debtor's head. The state has given him a remedy which survives bankruptcy. If the bankrupt refuses to pay his discharged debt, the creditor will see to it that his driver's license is suspended. If, however, the bankrupt will pay up, the creditor will refrain.\n The practical pressures of this collection device are apparent. Where retention of the operator's license is essential to livelihood, as here alleged, the bankrupt is at the creditor's mercy. Bankruptcy is not then the sanctuary for hapless debtors which Congress intended. The bankrupt instead of receiving by virtue of his discharge 'a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt' (Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 244\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 699, 93 A.L.R. 195) finds himself still entangied with a former creditor.\n In practical effect the bankrupt may be in as bad, or even worse, a position than if the state had made it possible for a creditor to attach his future wages. Such a device \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 42]\n\u00a0\n would clearly contravene the Bankruptcy Act. Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, supra. The present one likewise runs afoul of the Act.\n But it is said that if this provision of the statute falls out, the old one falls in; and under the old one it was the duty of the clerk to certify the unsatisfied judgment to the commissioner. The difficulty with that view is that this is not that case. This bankrupt's license was suspended as a result of legal compulsion by the creditor. Whether it would have been suspended had the commissioner been advised that the amendment giving the creditor that power contravened the Bankruptcy Act is wholly conjectural. The question of whether a provision of a state statute survives an invalid amendment is a question of state law. See Meyer v. Wells, Fargo & Co., \n223 \nU.S. 298\n, 32 S.Ct. 218. We do not know what the ruling of the New York courts would be under this statute. Nor do we know whether as a matter of administrative policy the clerk and the commissioner would have proceeded on the basis of the old statute or would have awaited legislative clarification. But since we do know that the bankrupt was deprived of his license by reason of a statute which conflicts with the Bankruptcy Act, we should strike down the statutory provision which in fact was invoked.\n The constitutional objection to this statute, however, persists even though we assume that the bankrupt's license would have been suspended without the creditor's initiative. The act also provides that 'if the judgment creditor consents in writing that the judgment debtor be allowed license and registration, the same may be allowed for six months from the date of such consent by the commissioner and thereafter. ...' (Italics supplied.) I do not think we can pass over that provision on the theory that the power of the creditor to lift the suspension does not appear to have been invoked in this case and that if the creditor \n\n[314 \nU.S. 33, 43]\n\u00a0\n attempts to exercise such power the commissioner will have to pass on the constitutional issue. Meanwhile the provision in question will give to the creditor enormous leverage. His bargaining position will be greatly fortified. The bankrupt is at his mercy where the means of livelihood are at stake. If the bankrupt agrees to a settlement, makes arrangements for instalment payments, or the like, the creditor will see to it that the license is restored. If the bankrupt rests on his rights, the creditor will show no mercy. In the interim there is no way by which the bankrupt can rid himself of that pressure, unless he makes peace with the creditor; he cannot force the constitutional issue in any way other than the present suit. If the creditor agrees to lift the suspension, the bankrupt would be the last to object. In any event, the provision by that time would have spent much of its force. In short, this power which New York has given the creditor is a powerful collection device which should not be allowed to survive bankruptcy.\n I agree that we should not meet a constitutional issue unless it is unavoidable. But that issue cannot be escaped here, unless we are to overlook the realities of collection methods.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice BYRNES, and Mr. Justice JACKSON join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Consolidated Laws ch. 71. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 11 U.S.C.  35, 11 U.S.C.A.  35. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] D.C., 34 F.Supp. 532. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See  94-c. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] New York Laws, 1936, ch. 448. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] New York Laws, 1939, ch. 618. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See also Munz v.

Hall, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 292]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward J. Ennis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A collector of internal revenue, who had accepted a surety bond filed with him by a taxpayer to accompany his claim for abatement of income tax, consented to termination of all liability upon the bond and surrendered it before its obligation was fully satisfied. The questions for decision are whether the collector had power to release the obligation of the bond and, if not, whether the United States is entitled to interest on the amount of its claim against the surety.\n Upon the Commissioner's assessment in 1920 of additional income taxes in the sum of $29,128, asserted to be due from the taxpayer for 1917, the taxpayer filed a claim for abatement of the assessment, and to secure suspension of collection of the tax, executed a bond to the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n collector in the sum of $38,000 with petitioner as surety, conditioned upon payment on May 2, 1923, of the tax with interest. The Commissioner allowed the claim in abatement in part but rejected it to the extent of $8, 223.38, on which interest had then accrued in the sum of $4,169.07. On demand of the Commissioner on August 5, 1926, for the principal amount of the tax with interest to the date of demand, petitioner paid only the principal amount of the tax to the collector by draft of December 17, 1926, bearing the notation on its face that it was in full payment of the tax and of all liability on the bond. The collector collected the draft and surrendered the bond to petitioner with the statement that all liability on it had terminated.\n In the present suit on the bond the District Court held that the collector was without authority to release the bond and gave judgment for the sum of $4,169.07 found by the Commissioner to be the interest on the unpaid tax to the date of the rejection of the claim for its abatement, but refused to allow interest accruing subsequent to that date. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that under  370 of the New York General Business Law, interest at six per cent. should be added to the unpaid balance found to be due on the bond and modified the judgment accordingly. 2 Cir., 116 F.2d 247. We granted certiorari April 7, 1941, \n313 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S.Ct. 838, 85 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the questions presented, and of a conflict of the decision below with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Heinemann Chemical Co. v. United States, 92 F.2d 302.\n It is not denied that the collector had authority to accept the bond, that it created a new cause of action distinct from that on the taxpayer's obligation, and that if it has not been released, the United States has authority to sue upon it, see United States v. John Barth Co., \n279 \nU.S. 370\n, 49 S.Ct. 366; Gulf States Steel Co. v. United States, 287 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 294]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 32, 53 S.Ct. 69; United States v. Wolper, 2 Cir., 86 F. 2d 715; United States v. Oswego Falls Corp., 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 322. And it is conceded that, as the bond was conditioned on the payment of the taxes with interest, petitioner is indebted to the Government upon it for the amount of the interest which had accrued at the time of the rejection of the claim in abatement. See Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 282\n, 49 S.Ct. 129; ughson v. United States, 9 Cir., 59 F.2d 17, 19; United States v. Steinberg, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 124, 126. Respondent's contentions are that the balance of interest then due was released by the collector and that in any case it was not bound to pay interest on that balance.\n Power to release or otherwise dispose of the rights and property of the United States is lodged in the Congress by the Constitution.

There is no statute in terms authorizing them to remit taxes, to pass upon the claims for abatement of taxes or to release any obligation for their payment. Only the Commissioner, with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to compromise a tax deficiency for a sum less than \n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 295]\n\u00a0\n the amount lawfully due. R.S.  3220, 3229, 26 U.S.C.  1661, (26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  3770, 3776, 3761); 45 T.R., Art. 1011 (1918 Act); Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, supra, 278 U.S. page 288, 49 S.Ct. page 131; Loewy & Son v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 31 F.2d 652, 654.\n There is thus no basis in the statutes of the United States for implying an authority in a collector to release a bond for the payment of the tax which the Commissioner alone is permitted to reduce by way of compromise when the Secretary of the Treasury consents. Heinemann Chemical Co. v. United States, supra, and Brewerton v. United States, Ct.Cl., 9 F. Supp. 503, to the contrary, plainly rest upon a misapplication of the ruling in United States v. Alexander, \n110 \nU.S. 325\n, 4 S.Ct. 99, which sustained the release of a bond for taxes by the Secretary of the Treasury which had been specifically authorized by an Act of Congress.\n The District Court rejected the Government's claim for interest upon the balance found due upon the bond as a demand for interest on interest which has generally been held not to be an appropriate measure of damages for the delayed payment of interest alone. See Cherokee Nation v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 476, 490\n, 46 S.Ct. 428, 433. In any case it thought that the allowance of interest would be inequitable because of the collector's return of the bond to petitioner and the Government's delay in bringing the suit. But, as the Court of Appeals held, the obligation of petitioner to pay the interest accrued on the principal amount of tax under the applicable provisions of the Revenue Act was not damage assessed against petitioner for its non-payment of interest. Petitioner's obligation was contractual to pay an amount found to be due from the taxpayer and the suit against it is for a debt ex contractu, due and owing in conformity to the terms of the bond. See United States v. John Barth Co ., supra; Gulf States Steel Co. v. United States, supra.\n A suit upon a contractual obligation to pay money at a fixed or ascertainable time is a suit to recover damage \n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 296]\n\u00a0\n for its breach, including both the principal amount a d interest by way of damage for delay in payment of the principal after the due date. And in the absence of any controlling statutory regulation the trial court is as competent to determine the amount of interest for delay as any other item of damage. United States v. United States Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 512, 528\n, 35 S.Ct. 298, 302; Young v. Godbe, 15 Wall. 562, 565; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 76 F.2d 626; United States v. Wagner, 9 Cir., 93 F.2d 77; United States v. Hamilton, 7 Cir., 96 F.2d 878, 117 A.L.R. 446; Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 97 F.2d 879, 881.\n But the rule governing the interest to be recovered as damages for delayed payment of a contractual obligation to the United States is not controlled by state statute or local common law. In the absence of an applicable federal statute it is for the federal courts to determine, according to their own criteria, the appropriate measure of damage, expressed in terms of interest, for non-payment of the amount found to be due. Board of Commissioners, Jackson County, v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 350\n, 352 S., 60 S.Ct. 285, 288, 289; Young v. Godbe, supra, 15 Wall. page 565; cf. Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 284, et seq., 34 S.Ct. 421, 425.\n The present suit is at law for the recovery of an amount due and owing which petitioner has contracted to pay. To such a case equitable rules relating to interest recoverable in suits for an accounting, or for recovery on quasi contractual obligations arising from payment of money by mistake, are inapplicable. United States v. United States Fidelity Co., supra, 236 U.S. page 528, 35 S.Ct. page 302; cf. Redfield v. Ystalyfera Iron Co., \n110 \nU.S. 174, 176\n, 3 S.Ct. 570, 571. Sanborn v. United States, \n135 \nU.S. 271, 281\n, 10 S.Ct. 812, 815; Redfield v. Bartels, \n139 \nU.S. 694, 702\n, 11 S.Ct. 683, 686.\n Here responsibility for delay in payment rests quite as much upon the debtor, who is chargeable with knowledge of its own obligation and the breach of it, as upon the creditor. And in the meantime the debtor has had the use of the money, of which its default has de- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 297]\n\u00a0\n prived the creditor. Interest upon the principal sum from the date of default, at a fair rate, is therefore an appropriate measure of damage for the delay in payment. United States v. United States Fidelity Co., supra, 236 U.S. page 528, 35 S.Ct. page 302; Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. Wagner, supra; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, supra. While the New York statute fixing the rate of interest is not controlling, the allowance of interest does not conflict with any state or federal policy and we think that in the circumstances of this case a suitable rate is that prevailing in the state where the obligation was given and to be performed. See Young v. Godbe, supra, 15 Wall. page 565; Board of Commissioners, Jackson County, v. United States, supra, 308 U.S. page 352, 60 S.Ct. page 289.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n I agree with the Court's judgment that the Collector of Internal Revenue did not have power to release a taxpayer from his obligation to pay, but I am unable to agree with the Court's conclusions on the question of interest. The contract on which the Government's suit rests contained no provision for interest. The state's interest law, according to the holding of the Court, is not controlling. Congress has enacted no law requiring payment of interest and fixing an interest rate on contracts guaranteeing tax payments. Nevertheless, this Court now requires that interest be paid-a judicial requirement which under similar circumstances has been frankly described as 'judicial law-making'. Board of County Commissioners v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 350\n, 60 S.Ct. 285, 288.\n Were the question an open one, I would be reluctant to acquiesce in holding that federal courts, in the absence of statutes, could or should assume the power to fix interest in such a case. But, granting that we have the power to take this step, the rate of interest to be charged \n\n[313 \nU.S. 289, 298]\n\u00a0\n is from necessity an element of the legislative and policy power thus exercised, and that rate must therefore be determined by the Court. The rate fixed in this case is 6%. Resolution as to the amount is rested in part at least on New York's legislative rate. The inference is that a different rate might apply to contracts guaranteeing tax payments made in other states. For it is well known that interest rates fixed by state legislatures are not uniform but vary in amount.\n Since in prescribing interest and fixing an interest rate we are passing upon questions of public policy, not marked at all by definite legislative boundaries, I find it difficult to agree to the result here for two reasons: (1) Unless the rate fixed is to be considered in the nature of a penalty, 6% seems very high. A smaller rate would appear to come nearer to harmonizing with fair and equitable interest exactions. (2) I am of opinion that since our 'judicial law-making' is and must be national in its scope, the law which we adopt fixing a rate of interest for transactions such as that here involved should operate with uniformity throughout the nation. Federal taxpayers or their sureties should not be required to pay 6% in one state, 4% in a second, and 10% in a third. Such varying rates are not subject to criticism by federal courts if they govern local intrastate trans-actions subject to state law. But it seems to me that federal taxpayers and their sureties should be subject to the same interest rate without regard to the state rates governing purely local transactions within a particular area in which federal taxpayers happen to reside. To the extent that the Court's opinion indicates the possibility of such a variance among the states, I am compelled to disagree.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRYERSON v. UNITED STATES(1941)\nNo. 495\nArgued: January 8, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. William M. Haddad and Walter T. Fisher, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. Francis Biddle, Sol. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 405, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a companion case to Helvering v. Hutchings, \n312 \nU.S. 393\n, 61 S.Ct. 653, 85 L.Ed. --, and United States v. Pelzer, \n312 \nU.S. 399\n, 61 S.Ct. 659, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day, and it presents the questions decided in those cases.\n The sole question raised by the petition for certiorari is whether, under  504(b) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 247, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 585, the donor of property in trust for numerous beneficiaries is entitled to a single gift tax exemption or exclusion to the extent of the first $5,000 of the gift or to separate exemptions of $5, 000 for each beneficiary. The Government insists that if that question be decided against it, it is nevertheless entitled to retain the judgment below in its favor because the gifts to the beneficiaries were of future interests which, by  504(b), are denied the benefit of the exclusion otherwise allowed by the section.\n In 1934 petitioners' testatrix transferred two single premium insurance policies on her own life maturing at a future date, as additions to two separate trusts, one created in 1933, the other established in 1934 but before the transfer. The instrument creating the first trust provided that the trustees should pay over one-fourth of the net income to Mary Ryerson Frost, one of the trustees, for life, with remainder over for life to her two dauthters if surviving at her death, with further remainders over to their issue per stirpes. The trust instrument directed that the remaining three-fourths of the income should be accumulated and added to the principal of the trust. It provided that the trust was to terminate upon the death of the last survivor of three persons, the first life tenant and her two daughters, and was then to be distributed, the particular distribution be- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 405, 407]\n\u00a0\n ing dependent upon contingencies which are not now material. The trust instrument also contained numerous provisions for the termination of the trust by joint action of the trustees, Donald McKay Frost and Mary Ryerson Frost, who was also life tenant, or by the survivor or other of them in the case of the death or mental incapacity of either. Other provisions were made for the termination of the trust and distribution of the trust property in the event of the death or mental incapacity of both, without having exercised their power of termination.\n The instrument creating the 1934 trust provided that upon the death of the grantor, who was the insured, who was living at the time of the transfer, the trustees should distribute the proceeds of the insurance as follows: If the widow of the grantor's son survived the grantor the income of one-third of the proceeds of the insurance policy was to be paid to the son's widow for life with remainders over to those persons who would be heirs at law of the son had he died at the same time as the life tenant. The remaining two-thirds of the proceeds or all if the son's widow did not survive the grantor, were to go to the descendants of the grantor's son then surviving, with gifts over in default of such descendants.\n In a suit brought by petitioner to recover overpaid gift taxes for the year 1934 the district court ruled that in the computation of the tax the taxpayer was entitled to two exclusions to the extent of $5,000 each for the gifts made to Mary Ryerson Frost and Donald McKay Frost under the 1933 trust and to three exclusions under the 1934 trust, one for the son's widow and two for his two living descendants. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, 114 F.2d 150, holding that the two trusts were the donees and that a single exclusion was allowable for each trust. We granted certiorari November 12, 1940, to resolve the conflict between the decision \n\n[312 \nU.S. 405, 408]\n\u00a0\n below and that of the Circuit Courts of Appeals in the Pelzer case and the Hutchings case.\n For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Hutchings case we hold that the beneficiaries of the two trusts were the persons to whom the gifts were made and that the gifts to them and not to the trusts, as the courts below held, were entitled to the benefit of the exclusion allowed by  504(b) provided the gifts were not of 'future interests' to which the section denies the benefit of the exclusion.\n As the Government has not sought certiorari it cannot attack the judgment below, but it is free to sustain it upon any legal ground which will support it. LeTulle v. Scofield, \n308 \nU.S. 415, 421\n, 422 S., 60 S.Ct. 313, 316. Even though the judgment below was rested upon the erroneous ground that the trusts were 'persons' to whom the gifts were made within the meaning of  504(b), the Government may justify the judgment here on the ground that petitioners are not entitled to the exclusions claimed so far as the gifts were of future interests.\n The gifts of a separate equal share of the corpus of the 1933 trust to each of the two trustees in the event of their joint request that the trust be terminated was a gift upon a contingency which might never happen. For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Pelzer case those gifts were of future interests within the meaning of  504(b) and consequently were not entitled to the benefit of the exclusion. While a present power of disposition for one's own benefit is the equivalent of ownership, see Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 370, et seq., 59 S.Ct. 900, 907, 123 A.L.R. 162 and cases cited, here the joint power was not for the joint benefit of the donees of the power. Its exercise could only operate for the benefit of each to the extent of one-half of the trust property and then only in the event that both agreed to unite in its exercise. In any case use and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 405, 409]\n\u00a0\n enjoyment of any part of the trust fund by either was postponed until such time as both joined in the exercise of the power. The interests granted to the trustees upon their termination of the trust should therefore have been included to their full extent in the computation of the gift tax because they were 'future interests' within the meaning of  504(b) and Art. XI, Treasury Regulations 79. As the petitioners have been allowed one exclusion by the judgment below which is not attacked here it is unnecessary to consider whether the life interest in the income given to Mary Ryerson Frost is a present or future interest within the meaning of  504(b).\n For like reasons we conclude that the gifts to the beneficiaries of the 1934 trust were of future interests and that the petitioners are entitled to no exclusion with respect to them. The gift of income to the life tenant was contingent upon her survivorship of the grantor at a future date. The gifts of the principal amount of the proceeds of the policy to descendants of the deceased son of the grantor were in part contingent upon their survivorship of the son's widow and her survivorship of the grantor or, if she did not survive him, then the gifts of the entire principal were contingent upon survivorship of the descendants at the grantor's death. Thus all those who might become entitled to the use and enjoyment of the trust, principal and income, were ascertainable only upon the happening of one or more uncertain future events, survivorship of one or more persons at the death of the donor, and so they were donees of gifts of 'future interests' within the meaning of  504(b) and the treasury regulations. Consequently petitioners are not entitled to the single exclusion which the court below allowed. But because the Government has sought no cross-petition attacking the judgment below, it must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAMPSELL v. IMPERIAL PAPER & COLOR CORPORATION(1941)\nNo. 601\nArgued: March 31, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied June 2, 1941\n\n\n See \n313 \nU.S. 600\n, 61 S.Ct. 1107, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Mr. Thomas S. Tobin, of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. iram E. Casey, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n One Downey was adjudged a voluntary bankrupt in November, 1938. Prior to June, 1936, Downey had been engaged in business, unincorporated, and had incurred a debt to the predecessor of Standard Coated Products Corporation of approximately $104,000. In that month he formed a corporation, Downey Wallpaper & Paint Co., under the laws of California. Downey, his wife and his son were the sole stockholders, directors and officers. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 215, 216]\n\u00a0\n Downey's stock of goods was transferred to the corporation1 on credit, which was extended from time to time. He leased space in the store building occupied by him to the corporation, which continued business at the old stand. Except for qualifying shares,2 neither he nor the other members of his family paid cash for the stock which was issued to them3 but received most of those shares a few months prior to bankruptcy in satisfaction of the balance of the obligation owed to him by the corporation. \n4\n Respondent extended credit to the corporation. At the time of Downey's bankruptcy respondent's claim amounted to about $5,400 and was unsecured.\n On petition of the trustee in bankruptcy, the referee issued an order to show cause directed to the corporation, Downey, his wife and son why the assets of the corporation should not be marshalled for the benefit of the creditors of the bankrupt estate and administered by the trustee. \n5\n Downey answered. There was a hearing. The referee found, inter alia, that the transfer of the property to the corporation was not in good faith but was made for the purpose of placing the property beyond the reach of Downey's creditors and of retaining for \n\n[313 \nU.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n Downey and his family all of the beneficial interest therein; that the stock was issued in satisfaction of Downey's claim against the corporation, when Downey was hopelessly insolvent, to prevent Downey's creditors from reaching the assets so transferred; that the corporation was 'nothing but a sham and a cloak' devised by Downey 'for the purpose of preserving and conserving his assets' for the benefit of himself and his family; and that the corporation was formed for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding his creditors. The referee accordingly ordered that the property of the corporation was property of the bankrupt estate and that it be administered for the benefit of the creditors of the estate. That order was entered on April 7, 1939. No appeal from that order was taken.\n Respondent, who was not a party to that proceeding, later filed its claim stating that as a creditor of the corporation it had a prior right to distribution of the funds in the hands of the trustee received from the liquidation of the assets of the corporation. It secured an order to show cause why the trustee should not so apply such funds. The trustee objected to the allowance of the claim as a prior claim and contended that it should be allowed only as a general unsecured claim. There was a hearing. The referee found that respondent w th knowledge of Downey's indebtedness was instrumental in getting him to form the corporation and had full knowledge of its fraudulent character. He disallowed respondent's claim as a prior claim but allowed it as a general unsecured claim. That order was confirmed. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's claim should be accorded priority against the funds realized from the liquidation of the corporation's property. 9 Cir., 114 F.2d 49. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n312 \nU.S. 669\n, 61 S.Ct. 449, 85 L. Ed. --, because of the importance in administration of the bankruptcy act of the questions raised. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n We think the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error.\n\n 1. \nThe order entered in the summary proceedings against Downey, his wife, his son and his family corporation was a final order binding as between the parties. There can be no question but that the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was properly exercised by summary proceedings. The circumstances are many and varied where an affiliated corporation does not have, as against the trustee of the dominant stockholder, the status of a substantial adverse claimant within the rule of Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co ., Inc., v. Fox, \n264 \nU.S. 426\n, 44 S.Ct. 396. The legal existence of the affiliated corporation does not per se give it standing to insist on a plenary suit. In re Muncie Pulp Co., 2 Cir., 139 F. 546; W. A. Liller Bldg. Co. v. Reynolds, 4 Cir., 247 F. 90; In re Rieger, Kapner & Altmark, D.C., 157 F. 609; In re Eilers Music House, 9 Cir., 270 F. 915; Central Republic Bank & Trust Co. v. Caldwell, 8 Cir., 58 F.2d 721; Commerce Trust Co. v. Woodbury, 8 Cir., 77 F.2d 478; Fish v. East, 10 Cir., 114 F.2d 177.\n Mere legal paraphernalia will not suffice to transform into a substantial adverse claimant a corporation whose affairs are so closely assimilated to the affairs of the dominant stockholder that in substance it is little more than his corporate pocket. Whatever the full reach of that rule may be, it is clear that a family corporation's adverse claim is merely colorable where, as in this case, the corporation is formed in order to continue the bankrupt's business, where the bankrupt remains in control, and where the effect of the transfer is to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors. In re Schoenberg, 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 321; In re Berkowitz, D.C., 173 F. 1013. And see Glenn, Liquidation,  30-32. Cf. Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348\n, 53 S.Ct. 142, 85 A.L.R. 128. Hence, Downey's corporation was in no position to assert against Downey's trustee that it was so separate and insulated from Downey's other business affairs as to stand in an independent and adverse position. Furthermore, there was no appeal \n\n[313 \nU.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n from the order entered in the summary proceedings. It therefore could not be collaterally attacked in the proceedings by which respondent sought priority for its claim.\n\n 2. \nThat conclusion, of course, does not mean that the order consolidating the estates did, or in the absence of the respondent as a party, could determine what priority, if any, it had to the corporate assets. In re Foley, 9 Cir., 4 F.2d 154. All questions of fraudulent conveyance aside, creditors of the corporation normally would be entitled to satisfy their claims out of corporate assets prior to any participation by the creditors of the stockholder. In re Smith, 2 Cir., 36 F.2d 697. Such priority, however, would be denied if the corporation's creditors were parties to a fraudulent transfer of the stockholder's assets to the corporation. Furthermore, where the transfer was fraudulent or where the relationship between the stockholder and the corporation was such as to justify the use of summary proceedings to absorb the corporate assets into the bankruptcy estate of the stockholder, the corporation's unsecured creditors would have the burden of showing that their equity was paramount in order to obtain priority as respects the corporate assets. Cf. New York Trust C . v. Island Oil & Transport Corp., 2 Cir., 56 F.2d 580. The power of the bankruptcy court to subordinate claims or to adjudicate equities arising out of the relationship between the several creditors is complete. Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., \n306 \nU.S. 307\n, 59 S.Ct. 543; Pepper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295\n, 60 S.Ct. 238; Bird & Sons Sales Corp. v. Tobin, 8 Cir., 78 F.2d 371, 100 A.L.R. 654. But the theme of the Bankruptcy Act is equality of distribution.  65, sub. a, 11 U.S.C.A.  105, sub. a; Moore v. Bay, \n284 \nU.S. 4\n, 52 S.Ct. 3, 76 A.L.R. 1198. To bring himself outside of that rule an unsecured creditor carries a burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that its application to his case so as to deny him priority would work an injustice. Such burden has been sustained by creditors of the affiliated corporation and their paramount equity \n\n[313 \nU.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n has been established where there was no fraud in the transfer, where the transferor remained solvent, and where the creditors had extended credit to the transferee. Commerce Trust Co. v. Woodbury, supra.\n But in this case there was a fraudulent transfer. The saving clause in 13 Eliz. which protected innocent purchasers for value6 was not broad enough to protect mere unsecured creditors of the fraudulent transferee. Clark's Adm'r v. Rucker, 7 B.Mon., Ky., 583; Mullanphy Savings Bk. v. Lyle, 7 Lea 431, 75 Tenn. 431; Powell v. Ivey, 88 N.C. 256; Lockren v. Rustan, 9 N.D. 43, 45, 81 N.W. 60. To be sure, creditors of a fraudulent transferee have at times been accorded priority over the creditors of the transferor where they have 'taken the property into their own custody'. 1 Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences, 1940,  238. Cf. O'Gasapian v. Danielson, 284 Mass. 27, 187 N.E. 107, 89 A.L.R. 1159. The same result obtains in case of bona fide lien creditors of the fraudulent transferee. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Groseclose, 174 Okl. 193, 49 P.2d 1085; Plauche v. Streater Investment Corp., 189 La. 785, 180 So. 637. Cf. Haskell v. Phelps, 191 Wash. 567, 71 P.2d 550, 114 A.L.R. 403. And estoppel or other equitable considerations might well result in the award of priority even to unsecured creditors of the transferee, the conveyance being good between the parties. \n7\n Cf. Kennedy v. Georgia State \n\n[313 \nU.S. 215, 221]\n\u00a0\n Bank, 8 How. 586, 613. Yet none of these considerations is applicable here.\n The facts do not justify the invocation of estoppel against Downey's individual creditors. Respondent is neither a lien creditor nor an innocent grantee for value. At best it is in no more favorable position than a judgment creditor was has not levied execution. Furthermore, respondent had at least some knowledge as to the fraudulent character of Downey's corporation. Cf. Goodwin v. Hammond, 13 Cal. 168, 73 Am.Dec. 574; Bull v. Ford, 66 Cal. 176, 4 P. 1175. And title to the property fraudulently conveyed has vested in the bankruptcy trustee of the grantor. We have not been referred to any state law or any equitable considerations which under these circumstances would accord respondent the priority which it seeks. It therefore is entitled only to pari passu participation with Downey's individual creditors. Buffum v. Barceloux Co., \n289 \nU.S. 227\n, 53 S. Ct. 539.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A notice of the intended sale was recorded under the California Bulk Sales Law. Civil Code,  3440. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The shares had a par value of $100. Downey apparently said $500 in cash for the qualifying shares. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] There were 99 shares issued. On July 1, 1938, Downey caused 49 shares to be transferred to his wife and 25 shares to his son. Those transfers, according to the referee, were 'entirely without consideration' to Downey. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] There is some dispute as to the amount of this obligation. Petitioner insists, and the findings of the referee lend some support to his view, that the stock of goods was transferred to the corporation at the inventory price-about $14,000. The court below said that it was transferred at $7,500. The corporation apparently had paid $5,000 on that obligation. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Shortly after the adjudication the receiver, pursuant to a stipulation, took possession of the property of the corporation. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Clements v. Moore, 6 Wall. 299; Harrell v. Beall, 17 Wall. 590. That the same result follows in absence of the saving clause see Astor v. Wells, 4 Wheat. 466, interpreting L.Ohio, 1809-10, ch. LVII,  2.

Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On July 29, 1936, petitioner filed its capital stock tax1 return for the period ended June 30, 1936. This return \n\n[314 \nU.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n was prepared by petitioner's treasurer and signed by petitioner's president. The treasurer had been instructed by petitioner's vice- president to place upon the capital stock a value of $1,000,000. By mistake the value was declared at $600,000. This error was not noted by petitioner's president when he signed the return. When the error was later discovered, a new return was prepared declaring the value of the stock to be $1,000,000. This return was lodged with the Collector on September 3, 1936, and a remittance of $400.00 to cover the additional capital stock tax computed on the higher valuation was tendered. The Collector refused to accept the amended return2 and the remittance of the additional $400.00. Petitioner then filed a petition with the Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination of its excess profits tax3 for 1936, claiming \n\n[314 \nU.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n that that tax should be computed on the basis of a declared value for its capital stock of $1,000,000. The Board sustained the action of the Commissioner. 41 B.T.A. 278. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 572. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 557\n, 61 S. Ct. 1111, because of a conflict between that holding and the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Lerner Stores Corp. (Maryland) v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 455.\n Sec. 105(f) of the Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 1018, provides that the adjusted declared value of the taxpayer's capital stock shall be the value as declared in the 'first return'. The value so declared 'cannot be amended'.  105(f). The return must be made within one month after the close of the year with respect to which the tax is imposed.  105(d). While the Commissioner by rules and regulations 'may extend the time for making' the return, no extension shall be for more than sixty days.  105( d). Under Art. 37(b) of Treasury Regulations 64 (1936 ed.) an extension of time for filing the return and paying the tax shall be granted only upon written application under oath filed on or before the statutory due date and on a showing of reasonable cause for an extension. Petitioner sought no such extension. It did, however, file the amended return within the sixty day period.\n We agree with the court below that the amended return was properly disallowed. A 'first return' means a return 'for the first year in which the taxpayer exercises the privilege of fixing its capital stock value for tax purposes, and includes a timely amended return for that year.' Haggar Co. v. Helvering, \n308 \nU.S. 389, 395\n, 60 S.Ct. 337, 340. The return filed on September 3, 1936 was not timely. The statute is not ambiguous. Once the period for filing the 'first return' has expired, the value declared 'cannot be amended'. Unless an extension had previously been obtained, the period for filing ended one month after the close of the taxable year which in this case was June 30, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n 1936. Unlike the situation in Haggar Co. v. Helvering, supra, the due date of the return had not been extended. Nor did the statute make mandatory or automatic an extension for sixty days. It merely gave the Commissioner the power to extend the due date under appropriate rules and regulations. And the latter made no provision for an extension after the expiration of the statutory period. It is immaterial that different rules and regulations might have been promulgated under which an extension might have been obtained in the circumstances of this case. The important consideration is that this amended return was filed after the unextended or statutory due date had expired. In absence of an extension a later due date would have no statutory sanction. See J. E. Riley Investment Co. v. Commissioner, \n311 \nU.S. 55\n, 61 S.Ct. 95. Furthermore, the mandate of the statute that the declaration of value contained in the first return cannot be amended must be taken to preclude an amendment after the due date if that prohibition is to have real vitality.\n But petitioner argues that a court of equity has power to relieve against such mistakes. Cf. Moffett, Hodgkins & Clarke Co. v. City of Rochester, \n178 \nU.S. 373\n, 20 S.Ct. 957. Its contention is that the amended return reflects its original intent rather than a shift in position. But we cannot treat this case like a case for reformation of a contract. We are dealing here with an Act of Congress which not only prescribes the formula for determining the time within which a return may be filed but which also explicitly states that a declaration of value contained in the original return may not be amended. Hence no extension of the due date may be had except pursuant to the procedure which has clear statutory sanction. If we were to grant petitioner the extension which it asks, we would be performing a legislative or administrative,4 not a judicial, function. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n The result in individual cases may be harsh. But that may be true in case of any statute of limitations. As we indicated in J. E. Riley Investment Co. v. Commissioner, supra, such considerations, though a basis for an appeal to Congress for relief in individual cases,5 are not appropriate grounds for relief by the courts from the strictness of the statutory demand.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 105(a) of the Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 1017, as amended by  401 of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1733, provides:\n'For each year ending June 30, beginning with the year ending June 30, 1936, there is hereby imposed upon every domestic corporation with respect to carrying on or doing business for any part of such year an excise tax of $1 for each $1,000 of the adjusted declared value of its capital stock.' 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 798. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner sought to enjoin the Collector from refusing to accept the amended return.

From the Committee Reports it appears that due to a mistake by Western Union Telegraph Co. in transmitting a message from the president of the company to its cashier, the latter filed a return in which the value of the capital stock was declared to be $175 per share rather than $125 per share as the president had directed.

SHEETS(1941)\nNo. 727\nArgued: April 8, 1941Decided: April 28, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. M. Sutton and R. C. Johnson, both of Amarillo, Tex., for petitioner.\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Byron Singleton, of Amarillo, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a citizen of Texas and defendant in a court of that state set up, by way of counterclaim or \n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n cross-action against petitioner, the non-citizen plaintiff in the suit, a cause of action for damages in excess of $3,000 for breach of a contract, which was separate and distinct from the alleged indebtedness sued upon by the petitioner. The question for decision is whether the suit in which the counterclaim is filed, is one removable by the plaintiff to the federal district court on grounds of diversity of citizenship under  28 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S.C.A.  71.\n The plaintiff in the state court removed the cause to the United States District Court for Northern Texas, which denied respondent's motion to remand. After a trial on the merits it gave judgment for petitioner, plaintiff below, both on the cause of action set up on its complaint in the suit and on the counterclaim. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, 115 F.2d 880, and ordered the cause remanded to the state court on the ground that the plaintiff in the state court was not a 'defendant' within the meaning of  28 of the Judicial Code, and so was not entitled to remove the cause under that section, which in terms authorizes the removal of a suit subject to its provisions only 'by the defendant or defendants therein'. We granted certiorari March 10, 1941, \n312 \nU.S. 675\n, 61 S.Ct. 739, 85 L.Ed. --, to resolve the conflict of the decision of the court below and that of Waco Hardware Co. v. Michig n Stove Co., 5 Cir., 91 F. 289; see West v. Aurora City, 6 Wall. 139, with numerous decisions of other circuit courts of appeals. Carson & Rand Lbr. Co. v. Holtzclaw, C.C., 39 F. 578; Bankers Securities Corp. v. Insurance Equities Corp., 3 Cir., 85 F.2d 856, 108 A.L.R. 960; Chambers v. Skelly Oil Co., 10 Cir., 87 F.2d 853, and cases cited in note 5 of the opinion below, 5 Cir., 115 F.2d 880, 882.\n We assume for purposes of decision, that if the cause was removable by petitioner, the removal proceedings were regular and timely; that respondent's counterclaim stated an independent cause of action and that the amount \n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 104]\n\u00a0\n in controversy in that action exceeded the jurisdictional amount, and we confine our decision to the question of statutory construction raised by the petition for certiorari.\n Petitioner argues that although nominally a plaintiff in the state court it was in point of substance a defendant to the cause of action asserted in the counterclaim upon which, under Texas procedure, judgment could go against the plaintiff in the full amount demanded. Peck v. McKellar, 33 Tex. 234; Gimbel & Son v. Gomprecht & Co., 89 Tex. 497, 35 S. W. 470; Harris v. Schlinke, 95 Tex. 88, 65 S.W. 172. But at the outset it is to be noted that decision turns on the meaning of the removal statute and not upon the characterization of the suit or the parties to it by state statutes or decisions. Mason City & Ft. Dodge Ry. Co. v. Boynton, \n204 \nU.S. 570\n, 27 S.Ct. 321. The removal statute which is nationwide in its operation, was intended to be uniform in its application, unaffected by local law definition or characterization of the subject matter to which it is to be applied. Hence the Act of Congress must be construed as setting up its own criteria, irrespective of local law, for determining in what instances suits are to be removed from the state to the federal courts. Cf. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77.\n Section 28 of the Judicial Code authorizes removal of the suits to which it applies 'by the defendant or defendants therein'.1 During the period from 1875 to 1887\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n the statute governing removals, 18 Stat. 470, 28 U.S.C.A.  71 note, specifically gave to 'either party' to the suit the privilege of removal. At all other periods since the adoption of the Judiciary Act of 1789 the statutes governing removals have in terms given the privilege of removal to 'defendants' alone, except the Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 558, 28 U.S.C.A.  71 note, continued as part of  28 of the Judicial Code, which permits either plaintiff or defendant to remove where there is the additional ground of prejudice and local influence.\n Section 12 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 79, 28 U.S.C.A.  71 note, declared that 'if a suit be commenced in any state court against an alien ... or ... against a citizen of another state, and the matter in dispute exceeds' the jurisdictional amount 'and the defendant shall, at the time of entering his appearance in such state court, file a petition for the removal of the cause,' it shall be removable to the circuit court. In West v. Aurora \n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n City, 6 Wall. 139, this Court held that removal of a cause from a state to a federal court could be effected under  12 only by a defendant against whom the suit is brought by process served upon him. Consequently a non-citizen plaintiff in the state court, against whom the citizen-defendant had asserted in the suit a claim by way of counterclaim which, under state law, had the character of an original suit, was not entitled to remove the cause. The Court ruled that the plaintiff, having submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the state court, was not entitled to avail himself of a right of removal conferred only on a defendant who has not submitted himself to the jurisdiction.\n By  3 of the Act of 1875, 28 U.S.C.A.  71 note, the practice on removal was greatly liberalized. It authorized 'either party, or any one or more of the plaintiffs or defendants entitled to remove any suit' from the state court to do so upon petition in such suit to the state court 'before or at the term at which said cause could be first tried and before the trial thereof'. These provisions were continued until the adoption of the provisions of the present statute so far as now material by the Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 552, 28 U.S.C.A.  71 note.\n We cannot assume that Congress, in thus revising the statute, was unaware of the history which we have just detailed,2 or certainly that it regarded as without signifi- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n cance the omission from the earlier act of the phrase 'either party', and the substitution for it of the phrase authorizing removal by the 'defendant or defendants' in the suit, or the like omission of the provision for removal at any time before the trial, and the substitution for it of the requirement that the removal petition be filed by the 'defendant' at or before the time he is required to plead in the state court.\n We think these alterations in the statute are of controlling significance as indicating the Congressional purpose to narrow the federal jurisdiction on removal by reviving in substance the provisions of  12 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as construed in West v. Aurora City, supra. See H. Rept. No. 1078, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. If, in reenacting in substance the pertinent provisions of  12 of the Judiciary Act, Congress intended to restrict the operation of those provisions or to reject the construction which this Court had placed upon them, by saving the right of a plaintiff, in any case or to any extent, to remove the cause upon the filing of a counterclaim praying an affirmative judgment against him, we can hardly suppose that it would have failed to use some appropriate language to express that intention. That its omission of the reference in the earlier statute to removal by 'either party' was deliberate is indicated by the committee reports which recommended the retention of the provisions of the Act of 1867 for removal by either plaintiff or defendant when an additional ground of removal \n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 108]\n\u00a0\n is prejudice and local influence. See H. Rept., op. cit., supra, p. 2.\n The cases in the federal courts on which petitioner relies have distinguished the decision in West v. Aurora City, supra, on the ground that it arose under an earlier statute. But we find no material difference upon the present issue between the two statutes, and the reasoning of the Court in support of its decision is as applicable to one as to the other. In some of those cases it is suggested also that a plaintiff who brings his suit in a state court for less than the jurisdictional amount does not waive his right to remove, upon the filing of a counterclaim against him. And petitioner argues that this is so even when, as in the present case the plaintiff's demand is in excess of the jurisdictional amount. But we think the amount of the plaintiff's demand in the state court is immaterial, for one does not acquire an asserted right by not waiving it and the question here is not of waiver but of the acquisition of a right which can only be conferred by Act of Congress. We can find no basis for saying that Congress, by omitting from the present statute all reference to 'plaintiffs,' intended to save a right of removal to some plaintiffs and not to others. The question of the right of removal, decided in Wichita Royalty Co. v. City National Bank of Wichita Falls, 5 Cir., 95 F. 2d 671, 674, on which petitioner also relies, was not presented to or passed upon by this Court. \n306 \nU.S. 103\n, 59 S.Ct. 420. It involved factors not here present which we find it unnecessary to consider.\n Not only does the language of the Act of 1887 evidence the Congressional purpose to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts on removal, but the policy of the successive acts of Congress regulating the jurisdiction of federal courts is one calling for the strict construction of such legislation. The power reserved to the states \n\n[313 \nU.S. 100, 109]\n\u00a0\n under the Constitution to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts, may be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the Judiciary Articles of the Constitution. 'Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined'.

Velde and Lambert Kaspers, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. F. Dammann, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case calls for decision as to the validity of Rules 35 and 37 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for District Courts of the United States. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In an action brought by the petitioner in the District Court for Northern Illinois to recover damages for bodily injuries, inflicted in Indiana, respondent answered denying the allegations of the complaint, and moved for an order requiring the petitioner to submit to a physical examination by one or more physicians appointed by the court to determine the nature and extent of her injuries. The court ordered that the petitioner submit to such an examination by a physician so appointed.\n Compliance having been refused, the respondent obtained an order to show cause why the petitioner should \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n not be punished for contempt. In response the petitioner challenged the authority of the court to order her to submit to the examination, asserting that the order was void. It appeared that the courts of Indiana, the state where the cause of action arose, hold such an order proper, 2 whereas the courts of Illinois, the state in which the trial court sat, hold that such an order cannot be made. \n3\n Neither state has any statute governing the matter.\n The court adjudged the petitioner guilty of contempt, and directed that she be committed until she should obey the order for examination or otherwise should be legally discharged from custody. The petitioner appealed.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that Rule 35, which authorizes an order for a physical examination in such a case, is valid, and affirmed the judgment. 4 The writ of certiorari ws granted because of the importance of the question involved.\n The Rules of Civil Procedure were promulgated under the authority of the Act of June 19, 1934,5 which is:\n'Be it enacted ... That the Supreme Court of the United States shall have the power to prescribe, by general rules, for the district courts of the United States and for the courts of the District of Columbia, the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and motions, and the practice and procedure in civil actions at law. Said rules shall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n rights of any litigant. They shall take effect six months after their promulgation, and thereafter all laws in conflict therewith shall be of no further force or effect.\n\n'Sec. 2. The court may at any time unite the general rules prescribed by it for cases in equity with those in actions at law so as to secure one form of civil action and procedure for both: Provided, however, That in such union of rules the right of trial by jury as at common law and declared by the seventh amendment to the Constitution shall be preserved to the parties inviolate. Such united rules shall not take effect until they shall have been reported to Congress by the Attorney General at the beginning of a regular session thereof and until after the close of such session.'\n\n The text of the relevant portions of Rules 35 and 37 is:\n'Rule 35. Physical And Mental Examination Of Persons\n\n'(a) Order for Examination. In an action in which the mental or physical condition of a party is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order him to submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the party to be examined and to all other parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.'\n\n'Rule 37. Refusal To Make Discovery: Consequences\n\n'(a) Refusal to Answer. ...\n\n'(b) Failure to Comply With Order.\n\n'(1) Contempt. If a party or other witness refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question after being directed to do so by the court in the district in which the deposition is being taken, the refusal may be considered a contempt of that court. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n '(2) Other Consequences. If any party ... refuses to obey ... an order made under Rule 35 requiring him to submit to a physical or mental examination, the court may make such orders in regard to the refusal as are just, and among others the following:\n\n'(i) An order that ... the physical or mental condition of the party ... shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;\n\n'(ii) An order ... prohibiting (the disobedient party) ... from introducing evidence of physical or mental condition;\n\n'(iii) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party;\n\n'(iii) An order striking out pleadings or orders or in addition thereto, an order directing the arrest of any party or agent of a party for disobeying any of such orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.'\n\n The contention of the petitioner, in final analysis, is that Rules 35 and 37 are not within the mandate of Congress to this court. This is the limit of permissible debate, since argument touching the broader questions of Congressional power and of the obligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state is foreclosed.\n Congress has undoubted power to regulate the practice and procedure of federal courts,6 and may exercise that power by delegating to this or other federal courts authority to make rules not inconsistent with the statutes \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n or Constitution of the United States;7 but it has never essayed to declare the substantive state law, or to abolish or nullify a right recognized by the substantive law of the state where the cause of action arose, save where a right or duty is imposed in a field committed to Congress by the Constitution. On the contrary it has enacted that the state law shall be the rule of decision in the federal courts. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Hence we conclude that the Act of June 19, 1934, was purposely restricted in its operation to matters of pleading and court practice and procedure. Its two provisos or caveats emphasize this restriction. The first is that the court shall not 'abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive rights', in the guise of regulating procedure. The second is that if the rules are to prescribe a single form of action for cases at law and suits in equity, the constitutional right to jury trial inherent in the former must be preserved. There are other limitations upon the authority to prescribe rules which might have been, but were not mentioned in the Act; for instance, the inability of a court, by rule, to extend or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by a statute. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Whatever may be said as to the effect of the Conformity Act10 while it remained in force, the rules, if they are within the authority granted by Congress, repeal that statute, and the District Court was not bound to follow the Illinois practice respecting an order for physical examination. On the other hand if the right to be exempt from such an order is one of substantive law, the Rules \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n of Decision Act11 required the District Court, though sitting in Illinois, to apply the law of Indiana, the state where the cause of action arose, and to order the examination. To avoid this dilemma the petitioner admits, and, we think, correctly, that Rules 35 and 37 are rules of procedure. She insists, nevertheless, that by the prohibition against abridging substantive rights, Congress has banned the rules here challenged. In order to reach this result she translates 'substantive' into 'important' or 'substantial' rights. And she urges that if a rule affects such a right, albeit the rule is one of procedure merely, its prescription is not within the statutory grant of power embodied in the Act of June 19, 1934. She contends that our decisions and recognized principles require us so to hold.\n The petitioner relies upon Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford, \n141 \nU.S. 250\n, 11 S.Ct. 1000, and Camden & Suburban R. Co. v. Stetson, \n177 \nU.S. 172\n, 20 S.Ct. 617. But these cases in reality sustain the validity of the rules. In the Botsford case an action to recover for a personal injury suffered in the territory of Utah12 was instituted in the United States Circuit Court for Indiana, which refused to order a physical examination. This court affirmed, on the ground that no authority for such an order was shown. There was no suggestion that the question was one of substantive law. The court first examines the practice at common law and finds that it never recognized such an order. Then, acknowledging that a statute of the United States authorizing an order of the sort would be valid, the opinion finds there is none. Thus the matter is treated as one of procedure, for Congress has not, if it could, declared by statute the substantive law of a state. After \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n stating that the decision law of Indiana on the subject appeared not to be settled, and that a cited statute of that State was not in point, the court added that the question was not one of the law of Indiana but of the law of the United States and that the federal statutes by their provisions as to proof in actions at law precluded the application of the Conformity Act. Again, therefore, the opinion recognized that the matter is one of procedure, for both the cited federal statutes, concerning the mode of proof in federal courts, and the Conformity Act, deal solely with procedure.\n In fine, the decision was only that the making of such an order is regulable by statute, that the federal statutes forbade it, and hence the Conformity Act could not be thought to authorize the practice by reference to and incorporation of state law.\n In the Stetson case the action was brought in the District Court for New Jersey by a citizen of Pennsylvania, who, while a citizen of New Jersey, had been injured in the latter state. A statute of New Jersey authorized the state courts to order a physical examination of a plaintiff in an action for damages pending therein. The District Court refused to order such an examination on the ground that it lacked power so to do. After a verdict and judgment for plaintiff the defendant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, assigning the refusal as error. That court certified the question, 3 Cir., 104 F. 1004, and this court answered that the District Court had power to order the examination.\n The court stated that in the Botsford case there was no statute authorizing such an order, but said that here there was a state statute which by the Rules of Decision Act was made a law of the United States and must be given effect in a trial in a federal court. While it is true the court referred to the Rules of Decision Act, R.S.  721, 28 U.S.C.A.  725, and not to the Conformity Act, R.S.  914, 28 U.S.C.A.  724, the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n entire discussion goes upon the assumption that the matter is procedural. In any event, the distinction between substantive and procedural law was immaterial, for the cause of action arose and the trial was had in New Jersey. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n In the instant case we have a rule which, if within the power delegated to this court, has the force of a federal statute, and neither the Botsford nor the Stetson case is authority for ignoring it.\n The remaining case on which petitioner leans is Stack v. New York, etc., R. Co., 177 Mass. 155, 58 N.E. 686, 52 L.R.A. 328, 83 Am.St.Rep. 269, where the court agreed with the view expressed in the Botsford case that common-law practice did not warrant the entry of such an order and said it was for the legislature rather than the courts to alter the practice. But if Rule 35 is within the authority granted, the federal legislature sanctioned it as controlling all district courts.\n We are thrown back, then, to the arguments drawn from the language of the Act of June 19, 1934. Is the phrase 'substantive rights' confined to rights conferred by law to be protected and enforced in accordance with the adjective law of judicial procedure? It certainly embraces such rights. One of them is the right not to be injured in one's person by another's negligence, to redress infraction of which the present action was brought. The petitioner says the phrase connotes more; that by its use Congress intended that in regulating procedure this court should not deal with important and substantial rights theretofore recognized. Recognized where and by whom? The state courts are divided as to the power in the absence of statute to order a physical examination. \n14\n In a number such an order is author- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n ized by statute or rule. 15 The rules in question accord with the procedure now in force in Canada and England. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The asserted right, moreover, is no more important than many others enjoyed by litigants in District Courts sitting in the several states, before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure altered and abolished old rights or privileges and created new ones in connection with the conduct of litigation. The suggestion that the rule offends the important right to freedom from invasion of the person ignores the fact that as we hold, no invasion of freedom from personal restraint attaches to refusal so to comply with its provisions. If we were to adopt the suggested criterion of the importance of the alleged right we should invite endless litigation and confusion worse confounded. The test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure,-the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them. That the rules in question are such is admitted.\n Finally, it is urged that Rules 35 and 37 work a major change of policy and that this was not intended by Congress. Apart from the fact already stated, that the policy of the states in this respect has not been uniform, it is to be noted that the authorization of a comprehensive system of court rules was a departure in policy, and that the new policy envisaged in the enabling act of 1934 was that the whole field of court procedure be regulated in the interest of speedy, fair and exact determination of the truth. The challenged rules comport with this policy. Moreover, in accordance with the Act, the rules were sub- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n mitted to the Congress so that that body might examine them and veto their going into effect if contrary to the policy of the legislature.\n The value of the reservation of the power to examine proposed rules, laws and regulations before they become effective is well understood by Congress. It is frequently, as here, employed to make sure that the action under the delegation squares with the Congressional purpose. \n17\n Evidently the Congress felt the rule was within the ambit of the statute as no effort was made to eliminate it from the proposed body of rules, although this specific rule was attacked and defended before the committees of the two Houses. \n18\n The Preliminary Draft of the rules called attention to the contrary practice indicated by the Botsford case, as did the Report of the Advisory Committee and the Notes prepared by the Com- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n mittee to accompany the final version of the rules. \n19\n That no adverse action was taken by Congress indicates, at least, that no transgression of legislative policy was found. We conclude that the rules under attack are within the authority granted.\n The District Court treated the refusal to comply with its order as a contempt and committed the petitioner therefor. Neither in the Circuit Court of Appeals nor here was this action assigned as error. We think, however, that in the light of the provisions of Rule 37 it was plain error of such a fundamental nature that we should notice it. \n20\n Section (b)(2)(iv) of Rule 37 exempts from punishment as for contempt the refusal to obey an order that a party submit to a physical or mental examination. The District Court was in error in going counter to this express exemption. The remedies available under the rule in such a case are those enumerated in Section (b)(2)(i)(ii) and (iii). For this error we reverse the judgment and remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER (dissenting).\n Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford, \n141 \nU.S. 250\n, 11 S.Ct. 1000, denied the power of the federal courts in a civil action to compel a plaintiff suing for injury to the person to submit to a physical examination. Nine years later, in Camden & Suburban Railway Co. v. Stetson, \n177 \nU.S. 172\n, 20 S.Ct. 617, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n the Botsford decision was treated as settled doctrine. The present issue is whether the authority which Congress gave to this Court to formulate rules of civil procedure for the district courts allows displacement of the law of the Botsford case. Stated more particularly, is Rule 35, authorizing such physical examination, valid under the Rules Enabling Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 28 U.S.C.  723b, 723c, 28 U.S.C.A.  723b, 723c. It is urged that since this Rule pertains to procedure, it is valid because outside the limitations of that Act, whereby 'said rules shall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant'.\n Speaking with diffidence in support of a view which has not commended itself to the Court, it does not seem to me that the answer to our question is to be found by an analytic determination whether the power of examination here claimed is a matter of procedure or a matter of substance, even assuming that the two are mutually exclusive categories with easily ascertainable contents. The problem seems to me to be controlled by the policy underlying the Botsford decision. Its doctrine was not a survival of an outworn technicality. It rested on considerations akin to what is familiarly known in the English law as the liberties of the subject. To be sure, the immunity that was recognized in the Botsford case has no constitutional sanction. It is amenable to statutory change. But the 'inviolability of a person' was deemed to have such historic roots in Anglo-American law that it was not to be curtailed 'unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law'. In this connection it is significant that a judge as responsive to procedural needs as was Mr. Justice Holmes, should, on behalf of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, have supported the Botsford doctrine on the ground that 'the common law was very slow to sanction any viola- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n tion of or interference with the person of a free citizen'. Stack v. New York, etc., R. Co., 177 Mass. 155, 157, 58 N.E. 686, 52 L.R.A. 328, 83 Am. St.Rep. 269.\n So far as national law is concerned, a drastic change in public policy in a matter deeply touching the sensibilities of people or even thier prejudices as to privacy, ought not to be inferred from a general authorization to formulate rules for the more uniform and effective dispatch of business on the civil side of the federal courts. I deem a requirement as to the invasion of the person to stand on a very different footing from questions pertaining to the discovery of documents, pre-trial procedure and other devices for the expeditious, economic and fair conduct of litigation. That disobedience of an order under Rule 35 cannot be visited with punishment as for contempt does not mitigate its intrusion into an historic immunity of the privacy of the person. Of course the Rule is compulsive in that the doors of the federal courts otherwise open may be shut to litigants who do not submit to such a physical examination.\n In this view little significance attaches to the fact that the Rules, in accordance with the statute, remained on the table of two Houses of Congress without evoking any objection to Rule 35 and thereby automatically came into force. Plainly the Rules are not acts of Congress and can not be treated as such. Having due regard to the mechanics of legislation and the practical conditions surrounding the business of Congress when the Rules were submitted, to draw any inference of tacit approval from non-action by Congress is to appeal to unreality. And so I conclude that to make the drastic change that Rule 35 sought to introduce would require explicit legislation.\n Ordinarily, disagreement with the majority on so-called procedural matters is best held in silence. Even in the present situation I should be loath to register dissent did \n\n[312 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n the issue pertain merely to diversity litigation. But Rule 35 applies to all civil litigation in the federal courts, and thus concerns the enforcement of federal rights and not merely of state law in the federal courts.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice MURPHY agree with these views. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 U.S.C.A. following  723c. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] South Bend v.

Dickenson, Jr., of Tampa, Fla., for appellant.\n Mr. Nathan Cockrell, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, Lambiris Skiriotes, was convicted in the county court of Pinellas County, Florida, of the use on March 8, 1938, of diving equipment in the taking of sponges from the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 70]\n\u00a0\n in violation of a state statute. Compiled General Laws of Florida (1927), Section 8087. The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida ( 197 So. 736) and the case comes here on appeal.\n The case was tried without a jury and the facts were stipulated. The statute, the text of which is set forth in the margin,1 forbids the use of diving suits, helmets or other apparatus used by deep sea divers, for the purpose of taking commercial sponges from the Gulf of Mexico, or the Straits of Florida or other waters within the territorial limits of that State.\n The charge was that appellant was using the forbidden apparatus 'at a point approximately two marine leagues from mean low tide on the West shore line of the State of Florida and within the territorial limits of the County of Pinellas'. The state court held that the western boundary of Florida was fixed by the state constitution of 1885 at three marine leagues (nine nautical miles) from the shore; that this was the same boundary which had been defined by the state constitution of 1868 to which the Act of Congress had referred in admitting the State of Florida to representation in Congress. Act of June 25, 1868, 15 Stat. 73. The state court sustained the right of the State to fix its marine boundary with \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 71]\n\u00a0\n the approval of Congress, and concluded that the statute was valid in its application to appellant's conduct.\n By motions to quash the information and in arrest of judgment, appellant contended that the constitution of Florida fixing the boundary of the State and the statute under which he was prosecuted violated the Constitution and treaties of the United States; that the criminal jurisdiction of the courts of Florida could not extend beyond the international boundaries of the United States and hence could not extend 'to a greater distance than one marine league from mean low tide' on the mainland of the State and adjacent islands included within its territory.\n In support of this contention appellant invoked several provisions of the Constitution of the United States, to wit, Article I, Section 10, Clauses 1 and 3, Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, Article VI, and the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellant also relied upon numerous treaties of the United States, including the Treaty with Spain of February 22, 1919, and the treaties with several countries, signed between 1924 and 1930, inclusive, for the prevention of smuggling of intoxicating liquors. There were also introduced in evidence diplomatic correspondence and extracts from statements of our Secretaries of State with respect to the limits of the territorial waters of the United States. These contentions were presented to the highest court of the State and were overruled.\n The first point of inquiry is with respect to the status of appellant. The stipulation of acts states that appellant 'is by trade and occupation a deep-sea diver engaged in sponge fishery, his resident address being at Tarpon Springs, Pinellas County, Florida', and that he 'has been engaged in this business for the past several years'. Appellant has not asserted or attempted to show that he is not a citizen of the United States, or that he is a citizen of any State other than Florida, or \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 72]\n\u00a0\n that he is a national of any foreign country. It is also significant that in his brief in this Court, replying to the State's argument that as a citizen of Florida he is not in a position to question the boundaries of the State as defined by its constitution, appellant has not challenged the statement as to his citizenship, while he does contest the legal consequences which the State insists flow from that fact.\n It further appears that upon appellant's arrest for violation of the statute, he sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court of the United States and was released, but this decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Cunningham, Sheriff, v. Skiriotes, 5 Cir., 101 F. 2d 635. That court thought that the question of the statute's validity should be determined in orderly procedure by the state court subject to appropriate review by this Court, but the court expressed doubt as to the right of the appellant to raise the question, saying: 'Skiriotes states he is a citizen of the United States resident in Florida, and therefore is a citizen of Florida. His boat, from which his diving operations were conducted, we may assume was a Florida vessel, carrying Florida law with her, but of course as modified by superior federal law'. Id., 101 F.2d pages 636, 637.\n In the light of appellant's statements to the federal court, judicially recited, and upon the present record showing his long residence in Florida and the absence of a claim of any other domicile or of any foreign allegiance, we are justified in assuming that he is a citizen of the United States and of Florida. Certainly appellant has not shown himself entitled to any greater rights than those which a citizen of Florida possesses.\n In these circumstances, no question of international law, or of the extent of the authority of the United States in its international relations, is presented. International law is a part of our law and as such is the law \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 73]\n\u00a0\n of all States of the Union (The Paquete Habana, \n175 \nU.S. 677, 700\n, 20 S.Ct. 290), but it is a part of our law for the application of its own principles, and these are concerned with international rights and duties and not with domestic rights and duties. The argument based on the limits of the territorial waters of the United States, as these are described by this Court in Cunard Steamship Company v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100, 122\n, 43 S.Ct. 504, 506, 27 A.L.R. 1306, and in diplomatic correspondence and statements of the political department of our Government, is thus beside the point. For, aside from the question of the extent of control which the United States may exert in the interest of self-protection over waters near its borders, although beyond its territorial limits,2 the United States is not debarred by any rule of international law from governing the conduct of its own citizens upon the high seas or even in foreign countries when the rights of other nations or their nationals are not infringed. With respect to such an exercise of authority there is no question of international law,3 but solely of the purport of the municipal law which establishes the duty of the citizen in relation to his own government. American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 355\n, 356 S., 29 S.Ct. 511, 512, 16 Ann.Cas.1047; United States v. Bowman, \n260 \nU.S. 94\n, 43 S.Ct. 39; Cook v. Tait, \n265 \nU.S. 47\n, 44 S.Ct. 444; Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421, 437\n, 52 S.Ct. 252, 254. Thus, a criminal statute dealing with acts that are directly injurious \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 74]\n\u00a0\n to the government, and are capable of perpetration without regard to particular locality is to be construed as applicable to citizens of the United States upon the high seas or in a foreign country, though there be no express declaration to that effect. United States v. Bowman, supra. \n4\n The Bowman case arose under Section 35 of the Criminal Code. 18 U.S.C., Sec. 80, 18 U.S.C.A.  80. Another illustration is found in the statute relating to criminal correspondence with foreign governments. 18 U.S.C., Sec. 5, 18 U.S.C.A.  5. In Cook v. Tait, supra, we held that Congress could impose a tax upon income received by a citizen of the United States who was domiciled in a foreign country although the income was derived from property there located. In Blackmer v. United States, supra, the validity of an Act of Congress requiring a citizen of the United States residing in France to return to this country for the purpose of giving testimony and the servide of a subpoena upon him personally by an American consul were sustained.\n For the same reason, none of the treaties which appellant cites are applicable to his case. He is not in a position to invoke the rights of other governments or of the nationals of other countries. If a statute similar to the one in question had been enacted by the Congress for the protection of the sponge fishery off the coasts of the United States there would appear to be no ground upon which appellant could challenge its validity.\n The question then is whether such an enactment, as applied to those who are subject to the jurisdiction of Florida, is beyond the competency of that State. We have not been referred to any legislation of Congress with which the state statute conflicts. By the Act of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 75]\n\u00a0\n August 15, 1914,5, 38 Stat. 692, 16 U.S.C., Sec. 781, 16 U.S.C.A.  781, Congress has prohibited 'any citizen of the United States, or person owing duty of obedience to the laws of the United States' from taking 'in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico or the Straits of Florida outside of state territorial limits' any commercial sponges which are less than a given size, or to possess such sponges or offer them for sale. But that Act is limited to the particular matter of size and does not deal with the divers' apparatus which is the particular subject of the Florida statute. According to familiar principles, Congress having occupied but a limited field, the authority of the State to protect its interests by additional or supplementary legislation otherwise valid is not impaired.

Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109\n, 61 S.Ct. 930, 85 L.Ed . --, decided April 28, 1941. Nor is there any repugnance in the provisions of the statute to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute applies equally to all persons within the jurisdiction of the State.\n Appellant's attack thus centers in the contention that the State has transcended its power simply because the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 76]\n\u00a0\n statute has been applied to his operations inimical to its interests outside the territorial waters of Florida. The State denies this, pointing to its boundaries as defined by the state constitution of 1868, which the State insists had the approval of Congress and in which there has been acquiescence over a long period. See Lipscomb v. Gialourakis, 101 Fla. 1130, 1134, 1135, 133 So. 104; Pope v. Blanton, D.C., 10 F.Supp. 18, 22.6 Appellant argues that Congress by the Act of June 25, 1868,7 to which the state court refers, did not specifically accept or approve any boundaries as set up in the state constitution but merely admitted Florida and the other States mentioned to representation in Congress. And, further, that if Congress can be regarded as having approved the boundaries defined by the state constitution, these have been changed by the treaties with foreign countries relating to the smuggling of intoxicating liquors, in which the principle of the three-mile limit was declared.\n But putting aside the treaties, which appellant has no standing to invoke, we do not find it necessary to resolve the contentions as to the interpretation and effect of the Act of Congress of 1868. Even if it were assumed that the locus of the offense was outside the territorial waters of Florida, it would not follow that the State could not prohibit its own citizens from the use of the described divers' equipment at that place. No question as to the authority of the United States over these waters, or over the sponge fishery, is here involved. No right of a citizen of any other State is here asserted. The question is solely between appellant and his own State. The present case thus differs from that of Manchester v. Massachusetts, supra, for there the regulation by Massa- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 77]\n\u00a0\n chusetts of the menhaden fisheries in Buzzards Bay was sought to be enforced as against citizens of Rhode Island (Id., page 242 of 139 U.S., page 559 of 11 S.Ct.) and it was in that relation that the question whether Buzzards Bay could be included within the territorial limits of Massachusetts was presented and was decided in favor of that Commonwealth. The question as to the extent of the authority of a State over its own citizens on the high seas was not involved.\n If the United States may control the conduct of its citizens upon the high seas, we see no reason why the State of Florida may not likewise govern the conduct of its citizens upon the high seas with respect to matters in which the State has a legitimate interest and where there is no conflict with acts of Congress. Save for the powers committed by the Constitution to the Union, the State of Florida has retained the status of a sovereign. Florida was admitted to the Union 'on equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatsoever'.8 And the power given to Congress by Section 3 of Article IV of the Constitution to admit new States relate only to such States as are equal to each other 'in power, dignity, and authority, each competent to exert that residuum of sovereignty not delegated to the United States by the Constitution itself'. Coyle v. Smith, \n221 \nU.S. 559, 567\n, 31 S.Ct. 688, 690.\n There is nothing novel in the doctrine that a State may exercise its authority over its citizens on the high seas. That doctrine was expounded in the case of The Hamilton (Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Gilmore), \n207 \nU.S. 398\n, 28 S.Ct. 133. There, a statute of Delaware giving damages for death was held to be a valid exercise of the power of the State, extending to the case of a citizen of that State wrongfully killed on the high seas in a vessel belonging to a Delaware corporation by the negligence of another vessel also belonging to a Delaware corporation. If it be said that the case was one of vessels and for the recognition of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 78]\n\u00a0\n the formula that a vessel at sea is regarded as part of the territory of the State, that principle would also be applicable here. There is no suggestion that appellant did not conduct his operations by means of Florida boats. That he did so conduct them was assumed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in dealing with appellant's arrest in Cunningham, Sheriff, v. Skiriotes, supra, and that reasonable inference has not in any way been rebutted here.\n But the principle recognized in The Hamilton, supra, was not limited by the conception of vessels as floating territory. There was recognition of the broader principle of the power of a sovereign State to govern the conduct of its citizens on the high seas. The court observed that 'apart from the subordination of the State of Delaware to the Constitution of the United States' there was no doubt of its power to make its statute applicable to the case at bar. And the basic reason was, as the court put it, that when so applied 'the statute governs the reciprocal liabilities of two corporations, existing only by virtue of the laws of Delaware, and permanently within its jurisdiction, for the consequences of conduct set in motion by them there, operating outside the territory of the state, it is true, but within no other territorial jurisdiction'. If confined to corporations, 'the state would have power to enforce its law to the extent of their property in every case'. But the court went on to say that 'the same authority would exist as to citizens domiciled within the state, even when personally on the high seas, and not only could be enforced by the state in case of their return, which their domicil by its very meaning promised, but, in proper cases, would be recognized in other jurisdictions by the courts of other states'. That is, 'the bare fact of the parties being outside the territory, in a place belonging to no other sovereign, would not limit the authority of the state, as accepted by civilized theory'. The Hamilton, supra, 207 U.S. page 403, 28 S.Ct. page 134. When its action does not conflict with \n\n[313 \nU.S. 69, 79]\n\u00a0\n federal legislation, the sovereign authority of the State over the conduct of its citizens upon the high seas is analogous to the sovereign authority of the United States over its citizens in like circumstances.\n We are not unmindful of the fact that the statutory prohibition refers to the 'Gulf of Mexico, or the Straits of Florida or other waters within the territorial limits of the State of Florida'. But we are dealing with the question of the validity of the statute as applied to appellant from the standpoint of state power. The State has applied it to appellant at the place of his operations and if the State had power to prohibit the described conduct of its citizen at that place we are not concerned from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution with the ruling of the state court as to the extent of territorial waters. The question before us must be considered in the light of the total power the State possesses (Del Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 684\n, 18 S.Ct. 229, 233; Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102; United Gas Co. v. Texas, \n303 \nU.S. 123, 142\n, 58 S.Ct. 483, 492), and so considered we find no ground for holding that the action of the State with respect to appellant transcended the limits of that power.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statute, originally Section 4 of Chapter 7389 of the Laws of Florida of 1917, carried forward as Section 5846 of the Revised General Statutes of Florida and as Section 8087 of the Compiled General Laws of 1927, is as follows:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, firm or corporation to maintain and use for the purpose of catching or taking commercial sponges from the Gulf of Mexico, or the Straits of Florida or other waters within the territorial limits of the State of Florida, diving suits, helmets or other apparatus used by deep sea divers.\n\n'Anyone violating any of the provisions of this section shall be fined in the sum not exceeding five hundred dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.'

O'GRADY(1941)\nNo. 364\nArgued: January 17, 1941Decided: February 17, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 329, 330]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William L. Marbury, Jr., of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. S. Beck, of Lincoln, Neb., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether petitioner's application for writ of habeas corpus filed in a Nebraska state court alleged facts which if proven entitled him to release from prison because he was held pursuant to a court judgment rendered in violation of rights guaranteed him by the federal Constitution. The trial court declined to issue the writ, holding that the petition failed to state a cause of action justifying the relief prayed. Without requiring the state to answer and without giving petitioner an opportunity to prove his allegations, the application was dismissed. A motion for reconsideration, setting out additional facts, was similarly dismissed. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed, without opinion.\n The judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court is a final and authoritative answer to petitioner's contention that his imprisonment was illegal under the state's constitution or laws. But petitioner also contended that \n\n[312 \nU.S. 329, 331]\n\u00a0\n his imprisonment was illegal under the federal Constitution. And in denying the writ the Nebraska court necessarily held that petitioner's allegations-even if proven in their entirety-would not entitle him to habeas corpus, even if the petition showed a deprivation of federally protected rights. \n1\n It was to review this question that we granted certiorari. \n311 \nU.S. 633\n, 61 S.Ct. 62, 85 L.Ed. --.\n But before examining the pleadings in order to determine whether the allegations showed a deprivation of federally protected rights, it is necessary to consider a preliminary contention urged by the state. The tenor of this contention is that under Nebraska law petitioner could not have his asserted federal rights determined in habeas corpus proceedings. And, supporting this contention, there is in the record a letter to petitioner from the trial judge who originally denied the writ-a letter indicating that petitioner's only relief from illegal imprisonment was by application to the Nebraska Parole and Pardon Board. This letter is not, however, a judicial determination, and apparently no state statutes or court decisions compel the result it indicates. Nor can we lightly assume that Nebraska affords no corrective process for one who is imprisoned under a judgment rendered in violation of rights protected by the federal Constitution. That Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and 'Upon the state courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard and enforce every right secured by that Constitution.' 2 Moreover, while \n\n[312 \nU.S. 329, 332]\n\u00a0\n the opinions of the Nebraska courts do not mark clearly the exact boundaries within which Nebraska confines the historic remedy of habeas corpus, the Nebraska Supreme Court has held that the writ was properly invoked to obtain release from imprisonment resulting from deprivation of constitutional rights. \n3\n Because of this, and because a contrary conclusion would apparently mean that Nebraska provides no judicial remedy whatsoever for petitioner even though he can show he is imprisoned in violation of procedural safeguards commanded by the federal Constitution,4 we are unable to reach the conclusion that habeas corpus is unavailable to him under Nebraska law.\n It is therefore our duty to examine petitioner's allegations in order to determine whether they show that his imprisonment is the result of a deprivation of rights guaranteed him by the federal Constitution. The heart of his charge is that he, an ignorant layman not represented by counsel, was tricked into pleading guilty to a serious offense. Among the specific allegations are:\n Petitioner, without being informed of the charges against him, was arrested in one county, and then removed to another county for two days. There he was told he was wanted for burglary in a third county (Valley County), but would be dealt with leniently if he would plead guilty. After a long distance telephone conversation between petitioner and a man identified as the prosecuting attorney of Valley County, a conversation arranged and listened to by the Valley County sheriff, a sentence of not over three years was agreed upon. Petitioner was soon thereafter transferred to the Valley \n\n[312 \nU.S. 329, 333]\n\u00a0\n County jail. His efforts to get copies of the charges filed against him were unsuccessful, the sheriff telling him that this was 'not necessary' since 'everything had been 'fixed.\" After three days in the Valley County jail, and 'without ever having had a copy of the charge', petitioner was taken before a trial judge, 'summarily arraigned, and, upon his prearranged plea of guilty, sentenced, to his surprise and consternation, to a term of twenty years imprisonment in the Nebraska State Penitentiary.' Petitioner, an uneducated layman, had no knowledge of law or legal procedure, and had never before been arrested or been in a court room for any purpose whatsoever. Upon imposition of the twenty year sentence, however, he vigorously protested, asked the court and the prosecuting attorney for a copy of the charge to which he had pleaded guilty, and, this request being refused, asked permission to withdraw his plea of guilty, requested appointment of an attorney to advice and assist him, and asked that he be given a proper opportunity to defend himself. All of these requests were refused by the court, and 'within the hour' he was on his way to the penitentiary, accompanied by the sheriff. After arriving at the penitentiary he discovered 'that he had been duped and inveigled into entering a plea of guilty to a charge of burglary with explosives ...,' punishable in Nebraska by twenty years to life imprisonment. Simple burglary, to which petitioner agreed to plead guilty, upon condition that he be sentenced to three years, carries a penalty of one to ten years. During the eight years petitioner has been in the penitentiary, he has done everything an uneducated person could do to bring his illegal imprisonment to the attention of the Nebraska authorities, but has not been able to get counsel because of lack of funds. His appeals to the Board of Pardons have been futile. Because of his ignorance of his rights, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 329, 334]\n\u00a0\n and because of the trial court's failure to appoint, and his inability to obtain, counsel, the original sentence was not appealed.\n These allegations, if true, undermine and invalidate the judgment upon which petitioner's imprisonment rests. The circumstances under which petitioner asserts he was entrapped and imprisoned in the penitentiary are wholly irreconcilable with the constitutional safeguards of due process. For his petition presents a picture of a defendant, without counsel, bewildered by court processes strange and unfamiliar to him, and inveigled by false statements of state law enforcement officers into entering a plea of guilty. The petitioner charged that he had been denied any real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process; that because of deception by the state's representatives he had pleaded guilty to a charge punishable by twenty years to life imprisonment; that his request for the benefit and advice of counsel had been denied by the court; and that he had been rushed to the penitentiary where his ignorance, confinement and poverty had precluded the possibility of his securing counsel in order to challenge the procedure by regular processes of appeal. If these things happened, petitioner is imprisoned under a judgment invalid because obtained in violation of procedural guaranties protected against state invasion through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n5\n The state court erroneously decided that the petition stated no cause of action. If petitioner can prove his allegations the judgment upon which his imprisonment rests was rendered in violation of due process and cannot stand.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is suggested that the Nebraska Supreme Court's final judgment of affirmance rested on petitioner's failure to file a printed brief in that court, and that this was an adequate non-federal ground, precluding our review of the federal question raised. But this contention is obviously not sound, because the Supreme Court denied petitioner's motion for relief from the rule requiring printed briefs solely in the ground that upon examination of the whole record the court had found the appeal to be without merit. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Mooney v.

While this action was pending, petitioner filed a bill in the Chancery Court of Knox County, Tennessee, alleging that respondent and the deceased were citizens of Tennessee; that petitioner, a Virginia corporation having its principal office in Richmond, Virginia, does no business in Missouri other than of an interstate character; that the accident occurred in Madison County, North Carolina, 'just beyond the North Carolina-Tennessee line'; that the Missouri federal court is more than 500 miles distant from respondent's residence, the residence of petitioner's witnesses, and the place where the accident occurred; that petitioner could not transport its witnesses to Missouri except at 'enormous expense'; that respondent's purpose in bringing suit in Missouri was to evade the law of Tennessee and North Carolina; and that petitioner maintains agents in Tennessee and North Carolina upon whom process can be served. The chancellor thereupon enjoined respondent from further prosecuting her action in the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n Missouri federal court and from instituting any similar suits against petitioner except in the state and federal courts in Tennessee and North Carolina. Respondent did not appeal from this decree. Instead, she filed a 'supplemental bill' in the Missouri federal court to enjoin the proceedings in the Tennessee state court. Holding that the commencement of respondent's action for damages gave the federal court 'specific, complete, sole and exclusive jurisdiction' which could not be 'intrenched upon' by proceedings in another court, the District Court, by an appropriate interlocutory decree, forbade petitioner from further prosecuting its suit in the Tennessee state court and ordered it to dismiss the state suit. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 117 F.2d 100. We brought the case here, \n313 \nU.S. 556\n, 61 S.Ct. 1093, in view of the relation of its jurisdictional problems to those in Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Company (Phoenix Finance Corporation v. Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Company), \n314 \nU.S. 118\n, 62 S. Ct. 139, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The limitations imposed on the power of the federal courts by  265 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  379, as we have applied them this day in the Toucey and Phoenix cases, supra, govern the disposition of this case. The restrictions of  265 upon the use of the injunction to stay a litigation in a state court confine the district courts even though such an injunction is sought in support of an earlier suit in the federal courts. Congress has endowed the federal courts with such protective jurisdiction neither generally, nor in the specific instance of claims arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Ever since the Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 334,  5, 28 U.S.C.A.  376-379, Congress has done precisely the opposite. Because of its views of appropriate policy in the interplay of state and federal judiciaries, Congress has forbidden the exclusive absorption of such litigation by the federal courts. If a state court proceeds as the Chancery \n\n[314 \nU.S. 155, 160]\n\u00a0\n Court of Tennessee acted, the ultimate vindication of any federal right lies with this Court.\n The District Court was here without power to enjoin petitioner from further prosecuting its suit in the Tennessee state court.\nREVERSED.\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice REED, concurring.\n The reasons which led to dissent in Toucey v.

The question for decision is whether the Alabama sales tax, with which the seller is chargeable, but which he is required \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n to collect from the buyer, infringes any constitutional immunity of the United States from state taxation.\n The Alabama statute, Act No. 18, General Acts of Alabama, 1939, p. 16, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  752 et seq., expressly made applicable to sales of building materials to contractors,  I(j), lays a tax of 2 per cent on the gross retail sales price of tangible personal property. While in terms,  II, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  753, the tax is laid on the seller, who is denominated the 'taxpayer', by  XXVI, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  776, it is made the duty of the seller 'to add to the sales price and collect from the purchaser the amount due by the taxpayer on account of said tax.'\n Section VII, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  757, provides that when sales are made on credit the tax is payable as and when the collection of the purchase price is made. The Supreme Court of Alabama has construed these provisions as imposing a legal obligation on the purchaser to pay the tax which the seller is required to add to his sales price and to collect from the purchaser upon collection of the price, whether the sale is for cash or on credit. See Lone Star Cement Corp. v. State Tax Commission, 234 Ala. 465, 175 So. 399; Long v. Roberts, 234 Ala. 570, 176 So. 213; National Linen Service Corp. v. State Tax Commission, 237 Ala. 360, 186 So. 478; Wood Preserving Corp. v. State Tax Commission, 235 Ala. 438, 179 So. 254. Section V, Code 1940, Tit. 51,  755, excludes from the tax the proceeds of sales which the state is prohibited from taxing by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n Respondents, King and Boozer, who furnished the lumber in question on the order of the contractors, appealed to the state circuit court from an assessment of the tax by the state department of revenue, on the ground that the tax is prohibited by the Constitution because laid upon the United States, and is excluded from the operation of the taxing statute by its terms. The United States was permitted to intervene and joined in these contentions.\n The trial upon a stipulation of facts, embodying the relevant documents, resulted in a decree sustaining the tax \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n which the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed, 3 So.2d 572, 579. Apart from the constitutional restriction, it found no want of authority in the taxing statute for the collection of the tax from the contractors. But it concluded that although the contractors were indebted to the seller for the purchase price of the lumber, they were so related by their contract to the Government's undertaking to build a camp, and were so far acting for the Government in the accomplishment of the governmental purpose, that the tax was in effect 'laid on a transaction by which the United States secures the things desired for governmental purposes', so as to infringe the constitutional immunity, citing Panhandle Oil Co. v. State ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 56 A.L.R. 583; Graves v. Texas Co., \n298 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S.Ct. 818. We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 599\n, 62 S.Ct. 118, 86 L.Ed. --, the question being one of public importance.\n Congress has declined to pass legislation immunizing from state taxation contractors under 'cost-plus' contracts for the construction of governmental projects. \n1\n Consequently the participants in the present transaction enjoy only such tax immunity as is afforded by the Constitution itself, and we are not now concerned with the extent and the appropriate exercise of the power of Congress to free such transactions from state taxation of individuals in such circumstances that the economic burden of the tax is passed on to the national government. The Government, rightly we think, disclaims any contention that the Constitution, unaided by Congressional legislation, prohibits a tax exacted from the contractors merely because it is passed on economically, by the terms of the contract or otherwise, as a part of the construction cost to the Government. So far as such a nondiscriminatory state tax upon the contractor enters into the cost of the materials \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n to the Government, that is but a normal incident of the organization within the same territory of two independent taxing sovereignties. The asserted right of the one to be free of taxation by the other does not spell immunity from paying the added costs, attributable to the taxation of those who furnish supplies to the Government and who have been granted no tax immunity. So far as a different view has prevailed, see Panhandle Oil Co. v. State ex rel. Knox, supra; Graves v. Texas Co., supra, we think it no longer tenable. See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S. Ct. 172; Trinityfarm Co. v. Grosjean, \n291 \nU.S. 466\n, 54 S.Ct. 469; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., \n302 \nU.S. 134, 160\n, 58 S. Ct. 208, 221, 114 A.L.R. 318; Helvering v. Gerhardt, \n304 \nU.S. 405, 416\n, 58 S.Ct. 969, 973; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n, 59 S.Ct. 595, 120 A.L.R. 1466\n\n\n The contention of the Government is that the tax is invalid because it is laid in such manner that, in the circumstances of this case, its legal incidence is on the Government rather than on the contractors who ordered the lumber and paid for it, but who, as the Government insists, have so acted for the Government as to place it in the role of a purchaser of the lumber. The argument runs: the Government was a purchaser of the lumber, and but for its immunity from suit and from taxation, the state applying its taxing statute could demand the tax from the Government just as from a private individual who had employed a contractor to do construction work upon a like cost-plus contract.\n The soundness of this conclusion turns on the terms of the contract and the rights and obligations of the parties under it. The taxing statute, as the Alabama courts have held, makes the 'purchaser' liable for the tax to the seller who is required 'to add to the sales price' the amount of the tax and collect it when the sales price is collected, whether the sale is for cash or on credit. Who, in any particular transaction like the present, is a 'purchaser' within the meaning of the statute, is a question of state \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n law on which only the Supreme Court of Alabama can speak with final authority. But it seems plain, as the Government concedes and as we assume for present purposes, that under the provisions of the statute the purchaser of tangible goods who is subjected to the tax measured by the sales price is the person who orders and pays for them when the sale is for cash or who is legally obligated to pay for them if the sale is on credit. The Government's contention is that it has a constitutional immunity from state taxation on its purchases and that this was sufficiently a Government purchase to come within the asserted immunity.\n As the sale of the lumber by King and Boozer was not for cash the precise question is whether the Government became obligated to pay for the lumber and so was the purchaser whom the statute taxes, but for the claimed immunity. By the cost-plus contract the contractors undertook to 'furnish the labor, materials, tools, machinery, equipment, facilities, supplies not furnished by the Government, and services, and to do all things necessary for the completion of' the specified work. In consideration of this the Government undertook to pay a fixed fee to the contractors and to reimburse them for specified expenses including their expenditures for all supplies and materials and 'state or local taxes ... which the contractor may be required on account of his contract to pay'. The contract provided that the title to all materials and supplies for which the contractors were 'entitled to be reimbursed' should vest in the Government 'upon delivery at the site of the work or at an approved storage site and upon inspection and acceptance in writing by the Contracting Officer'. The Government reserved the right to furnish any and all materials necessary for completion of the work, to pay freight charges directly to common carriers and 'to pay directly to the persons concerned all sums due from the Contractor for labor, materials or other charges.' Upon \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n termination of the contract by the Government it undertook to 'assume and become liable for all obligations ... that the Contractor may have theretofore in good faith undertaken or incurred in connection with said work and in accordance with the provisions of this contract'.\n A section of the contract, designated as one of several 'special requirements', stipulated that contractors should 'reduce to writing every contract in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000) made by him for the purpose of the work hereunder for services, materials, supplies ...; insert therein a provision that such contract is assignable to the Government; make all such contracts in his own name, and not bind or purport to bind the Government or the Contracting Officer thereunder'. While this section refers to contracts in excess of $2,000, we think all the provisions which we have mentioned, read together, plainly contemplate that the contractors were to purchase in their own names and on their own credit all the materials required, unless the Government should elect to furnish them; that the Government was not to be bound by their purchase contracts, but was obligated only to reimburse the contractors when the materials purchased should be delivered, inspected and accepted at the site.\n The course of business followed in the purchase of the lumber conformed in every material respect to the contract. King and Boozer submitted to the contractors in advance a proposal in writing to supply as ordered, at specified prices, all the lumber of certain description required for use in performing their contract with the Government. The contractors, after procuring approval by the contracting officer of the particular written order for lumber with which we are presently concerned, placed it with King and Boozer on January 17, 1941. It directed shipment to the Construction Quartermaster at the site 'for account of' the contractors and stated this purchase order does not bind, nor purport to bind, the United States \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Government or Government officers'. King and Boozer thereupon shipped the lumber ordered by the contractors by contract trucks to the site as directed, where it was used in performance of the contract. The sellers delivered to the contractors the invoice of the lumber, stating that it was 'sold to the United States Construction Quartermaster %' (for account of) the contractors. \n2\n The invoice was then approved by the Construction Quartermaster for payment; the contractors paid King and Boozer by their check the amount of the invoice and were later reimbursed by the Government for the cost of the lumber.\n We think, as the Supreme Court of Alabama held, that the legal effect of the transaction which we have detailed was to obligate the contractors to pay for the lumber. The lumber was sold and delivered on the order of the contractors which stipulated that the Government should not be bound to pay for it. It was in fact paid for by the contractors who were reimbursed by the Government pursuant to their contract with it. The contractors were thus purchasers of the lumber within the meaning of the taxing statute, and as such were subject to the tax. They were not relieved of the liability to pay the tax either because the contractors in a loose and general sense were acting for the Government in purchasing the lumber or, as the Alabama Supreme Court seems to have thought, because the economic burden of the tax imposed upon the purchaser would be shifted to the Government by reason of its contract to reimburse the contractors. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n The Government, to support its thesis that it was the purchaser, insists that title to the lumber passed to the Government on shipment by the seller, and points to the very extensive control by the Government over all purchases made by the contractors. It emphasizes the fact that the contract reserves to Government officers the decision of whether to buy and what to buy; that purchases of materials of $500 or over could be made by the contractors only when approved in advance by the contracting officer; that the Government reserved the right to approve the price, to furnish the materials itself, if it so elected; and that in the case of the lumber presently involved, the Government inspected and approved the lumber before shipment. From these circumstances it concludes that the Government was the purchaser. The necessary corollary of its position is that the Government, if a purchaser within the taxing statute, became obligated to pay the purchase price.\n But however extensively the Government may have reserved the right to restrict or control the action of the contractors in other respects, neither the reservation nor the exercise of that power gave to the contractors the status of agents of the Government to enter into contracts or to pledge its credit. See United States v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n305 \nU.S. 415, 421\n, 59 S.Ct. 267, 270; United States v. Driscoll, \n96 \nU.S. 421\n. It can hardly be said that the contractors were not free to obligate themselves for the purchase of material ordered. The contract contemplated that they should do so and that the Government should reimburse them for their expenditures. It is equally plain that they did not assume to bind the Government to pay for the lumber by their order, approved by the Contracting Officer, which stipulated that it did not bind or purport to bind the Government. The circumstance that the title to the lumber passed to the Government on delivery \n\n[314 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n does not obligate it to the contractor's vendor under a cost-plus contract more than under a lump sum contract. Cf. James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra; United States v. Driscoll, supra.\n We cannot say that the contractors were not, or that the Government was, bound to pay the purchase price, or that the contractors were not the purchasers on whom the statute lays the tax. The added circumstance that they were bound by their contract to furnish the purchased material to the Government and entitled to be reimbursed by it for the cost, including the tax, no more results in an infringement of the Government immunity than did the tax laid upon the contractor's gross receipts from the Government in James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra. See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, \n269 \nU.S. 523, 524\n, 46 S.Ct. 174; Trinityfarm Co. v. Grosjean, supra, \n291 \nU.S. 472\n, 54 S.Ct. 470; Helvering v.

PHILLIPS v. GUY F. ATKINSON CO.(1941)\nNo. 832\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 509]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claude C. Hatchett, of Durant, Okl., Randell S. Cobb, Mac Q. Williamson, and William O. Coe, all of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellant.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Asst. Sol. Gen., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 510]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves primarily the constitutionality of the Act of June 28, 1938, 52 Stat. 1215, insofar as it authorizes the construction of the Denison Reservoir on Red River in Texas and Oklahoma. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 511]\n\u00a0\n The bill in equity was filed by the State of Oklahoma seeking to enjoin the construction of any dam across Red River within the domain of Oklahoma which would impound the waters of the Red River (or its tributary, Washita River) so as to inundate and destroy any of the lands, highways or bridges belonging to or under the jurisdiction and control of the state or which would obliterate or interfere with its boundaries. The bill also seeks to restrain the institution or conduct in any court in Oklahoma of proceedings to condemn lands for the purpose of the dam or reservoir. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The bill alleges that Oklahoma will be injured in the following manner by construction of the project: The greater part of the dam will rest on Oklahoma soil and will form a reservoir inundating about 150,000 acres of land, of which 100,000 acres are located in Oklahoma. Of those acres about 3,800 are owned by the state. The United States will acquire title to the inundated land. The land owned by the state is used for school purposes, for a prison farm, for highways, rights of way, and bridges. The basin to be inundated is inhabited by about 8,000 Oklahoma citizens. Much of the land is rich soil in a high state of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 512]\n\u00a0\n cultivation. Much of it has large potential oil reserves. On some of it there are large producing oil wells and on other parts there are drilling operations and exploration for oil and gas. At least 15,000 acres will be highly productive oil lands and at least 50,000 acres are underlaid with oil and gas. There are thirty-nine school districts and townships in the four counties in which the affected area is located. Those governmental units are largely supported by ad valorem taxes. The taking of the 100,000 acres wil decrease the taxable property in each of the counties and take virtually all of the taxable property in many of the t wnships and school districts. Each of these governmental units has a large bonded indebtedness payable from an annual levy of taxes. Inundation of the land will deprive those units of much of the tax revenue, so that many will be practically destroyed and the remainder seriously hampered. Since the state derives much of its revenue from a gross production tax on oil and gas, it will suffer great losses in tax revenues from the inundation of the oil and gas lands. The 'annual wealth production' to the citizens of Oklahoma from the lands in the reservoir basin is about $1,500,000. Aside from such losses and losses from oil revenues and personal property taxation, the net taxable loss to the counties, townships and school districts will be about $40,000 annually.\n It is also alleged that the construction of the dam will be a 'direct invasion and destruction' of the sovereign and proprietary rights of Oklahoma in that: the boundary of Oklahoma will be obliterated for approximately 40 miles (see Oklahoma v. Texas, \n260 \nU.S. 606\n, 43 S.Ct. 221); there will be a 'forcible reduction of the area of plaintiff as one of the United States'; lands owned by it will be taken; its highways and bridges will be destroyed causing an interruption in communication between various parts of the state; the waters to be impounded belong to Oklahoma but will be taken from it without payment of just compensation; \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 513]\n\u00a0\n those waters will be diverted from Oklahoma and will be run through turbines located in Texas for the generation of power for sale principally in Texas; the removal of citizens from the 100,000 acres of land will create a 'serious social and economic problem', the burden of which will fall on Oklahoma for which no compensation is afforded.\n The bill incorporates H.Doc.No.541, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. (hereinafter called the Report) which contains the War Department's survey and recommendations on the Denison Reservoir and which served as the broad definition of the project which was authorized by the Act of June 28, 1938. The bill alleges that under the statutory scheme flood control and power purposes are 'inextricably and inserverably involved'. It alleges that, as described in the Report, the first 110 feet of the dam are to be used 'solely and exclusively for the development of waterpower', while 40 feet 'superimposed' on the power reservoir are to be used 'solely and exclusively' for flood control. That is to say, from elevation 510 feet ( sea level) to 590 feet there is to be a dead storage pool for waterpower head, from 595 feet to 620 feet there is to be a water power reservoir, and from 620 feet to 660 feet there is to be a flood control reservoir. It is alleged that those purposes are 'functionally separate and neither is the incidental or necessary result of the other'; that the same part of the reservoir will not and cannot be used for both flood control and waterpower purposes; and that the power portion of the dam is created at the expense of its utilization for flood control. The bill further alleges that as a result of the modification of the statutory plan set forth in the Report the dam is being constructed so as to provide dead storage for water head from 510 feet to 567 feet, a power pool reservoir from 587 feet to 617 feet and a flood control reservoir from 617 feet to 640 feet. It is alleged that by reason of that modification the reservoir \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 514]\n\u00a0\n will inundate 3,080,000 acre feet for power and 2,745,000 acre feet for flood control as contrasted to 3,400,000 acre feet for power and 5,900,000 acre feet for flood control under the original plan;3 and that, as a result, the statutory \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 515]\n\u00a0\n scheme has been charged from one preponderantly for flood control to one preponderantly for water power. It is also alleged that no part of the Red River in Oklahoma is navigable.\n The bill alleges that the Act under which appellees are proceeding is unconstitutional in that it violates the Tenth Amendment, that it is not within the powers of Congress conferred by Art. I, Sec. 8 of the Federal Constitution, and that since appellees are acting under a void and unconstitutional statute they should be enjoined. By an amendment to its bill, the state of Oklahoma also challenges the constitutionality of  4 of the Act of October 17, 1940, 54 Stat. 1200,4 Pub. No. 868, c. 895, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. The amended bill alleges that the project 'does not in any way protect or improve the navigable portions of the lower reaches of Red river or of the Mississippi river either by enriching the low water flow ... as the incidental result of the operation of said flood control and hydroelectric power project, except in the intangible, indirect, inconsequential and unsubstantial way' set forth in the Report; and that such inconsequential and intangible benefits to navigation as may result will flow from the flood control, not the power feature, of the project. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 516]\n\u00a0\n By motions to dismiss the appellees asserted, inter alia, that the Acts of Congress so challenged were constitutional and valid. The case was heard by a three judge court (Act of August 24, 1937, c. 754,  3, 50 Stat. 751, 28 U.S.C.  380a, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a) which sustained the Act authorizing the project. D.C., 37 F.Supp. 93. From a judgme t dismissing the complaint and denying the injunction, a direct appeal was taken to this Court.\n We are of the view that the Denison Dam and Reservoir project is a valid exercise of the commerce power by Congress.\n This project is a part of a rather recent chapter in the long history of flood control on the Mississippi River. \n5\n The federal government had concerned itself with the problems of navigation and flood control on that river long before6 the establishment of the Mississippi River Commission, 21 Stat. 37, 33 U.S.C.A.  641 et seq., in 1879. Earlier efforts towards a more comprehensive flood control program on a national scale7 were accelerated by the disastrous Mis- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 517]\n\u00a0\n sissippi flood in 1927. The agitation and concern over that disaster8 led to the enactment of the Flood Control Act of May 15, 1928, 45 Stat. 534,  10 of which provided that the Secretary of War should submit to Congress 'at the earliest practicable date projects for flood control on all tributary streams of the Mississippi River system subject to destructive floods which projects shall include: The Red River and tributaries ....' 33 U.S.C.A.  702j. That section of the Act also required a report on the effect on flood control of the lower Mississippi to be attained through the use of a reservoir system, the 'benefits that will accrue to navigation and agriculture' from the prevention of siltage and erosion, the 'prospective income from the disposal of reservoired waters', and 'inquiry as to the return flow of waters placed in the soils from reservoirs, and as to their stabilizing effect on stream flow as a means of preventing erosion, siltage, and improving navigation.' Pursuant to that authorization and direction a report (H.Doc.No.378, 74th Cong., 2d Sess.) was submitted on December 2, 1935, dealing at great length with the problems of the Red River and its tributaries and their relationship with the Mississippi.\n On June 22, 1936, there was enacted9 the Flood Control Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1570, 33 U.S.C.A.  701a et seq. Section 1 of the Act set \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 518]\n\u00a0\n forth a broad Congressional policy, stating, inter alia, that 'the Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries, including watersheds thereof, for flood- control purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected' and that 'destructive floods upon the rivers of the United Sta es, upsetting orderly processes and causing loss of life and property, including the erosion of lands, and impairing and obstructing navigation, highways, railroads, and other channels of commerce between the States, constitute a menace to national welfare.' That Act authorized the construction of various flood control projects. By  7 of that Act the Secretary of War was authorized and directed to continue the investigation of other projects, including the Denison Reservoir, where 'opportunities appear to exist for useful flood-control operations with economical development of hydroelectric power whenever sufficient markets to absorb such power become available.'\n Following the disastrous Ohio River flood in January, 1937, the House Committee on Flood Control requested10 the Chief of Engineers to submit 'comprehensive plans for protective works against floods in the Ohio Valley' and plans 'to further insure protection in the Mississippi Valley'. He submitted a report pursuant to that direction and recommended the construction of 45 flood-control reservoirs on the tributaries of the Ohio and 24 on other tributaries of the Mississippi, including the Red River. \n11\n As to the proposed Denison Reservoir he stated that it 'would remove the threat of the coincidence of a \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 519]\n\u00a0\n large flood from the Red with a flood in the Mississippi, and would also afford highly desirable protection to the fertile bottom lands in the lower Red River Valley. Besides its flood-control benefits, it has valuable potentiality for power purposes.' \n12\n And he added: 'On the Red River ... investigations indicate that a flood far exceeding any of record is distinctly possible. The Denison Reservoir would prevent such a flood from reaching disastrous proportions in the valley below it.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n On March 12, 1938, the Acting Secretary of War transmitted to Congress a report from the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, pursuant to the direction contained in  7 of the Flood Control Act of 1936. That Report, being the one here involved, (H.Doc.No.541, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.) recommended the construction of a dam near Denison, Texas, for the combined purpose of flood control and development of hydroelectric power. After hearings14 Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1938, here challenged, which authorized,15 inter alia, the Denison project on the basis of the Report and at an estimated cost of $54,000,000. This was followed by appropriations for the construction work16 and by the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 520]\n\u00a0\n Act of October 17, 1940, also challenged by appellant, declaring the Denison Reservoir to be 'for the purpose of improving navigation, regulating the flow of the Red River, controlling floods, and for other beneficial uses.' \n17\n Thus, while the Report spoke of the dam as a 'dual purpose' project, Congress did not so limit it but authorized it for multiple purposes.\n From this history it is plain that this project, which is part of a comprehensive flood control plan, is designed to control the watershed of one of the principal tributaries of the Mississippi in alleviation of floods in the lower Red River and Mississippi valleys. The Red River, sixth in length among rivers in the United States, has one of the largest watersheds in the country, draining an area about 50 per cent larger than New England-an area of 91,430 square miles, of which 38,291 square miles are above the dam site. \n18\n It rises near the east edge of New Mexico, flows easterly about 850 miles across the Texas Panhandle and between the states of Oklahoma and Texas to Fulton, Arkansas. From there it flows south and southeast some 460 miles and enters the Mississippi at Red River Landing. The site of the Denison dam is 228 miles up the river from Fulton. The contribution which the Red River makes to disastrous floods in its basin and in the lower Mississippi has long been recognized. Huge crop damage, the loss of buildings, bridges and livestock, pollution of fertile fields, the erosion of rich farm lands, bank cavings, interruption of navigation, injury of port facilities, the creation of sand bars in the channels, interruption or stoppage of interstate transportation by rail, truck and motorcar, disease, pestilence and death, relief of the homeless and destitute-all these are now familiar costs of the floods on the Missis- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 521]\n\u00a0\n sippi. \n19\n And the history of the Red River valley shows that it has long been plagued by such disasters and burdened by their costs. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n Floods pay no respect to state lines. \n21\n Their effective control in the Mississippi valley has become increasingly a subject of national concern22 in recognition of the fact \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 522]\n\u00a0\n that single states are impotent to cope with them effectively. The methods of dealing with them have elicited a contrariety of views. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n The idea of reservoir control on the tributaries of the Mississippi is not new. The Ellet report24 to the War Department in 1852 urged the making of surveys for the installation of reservoirs on the Red River and other tributaries which would serve the 'double purpose' of 'keeping back the floods' and relieving 'summer navigation from obstruction, by allowing the surplus so retained, to pass down in the season of low water.' \n25\n The emergence in recent years of comprehensive plans for reservoirs in the Mississippi river basin26 marks the development of an integrated system designed not only to alleviate ultimately flood conditions on the Mississippi itself but also to avoid or reduce local flood disasters. A part of the local benefits of flood control is frequently \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 523]\n\u00a0\n protection of navigation in the tributary itself. That is present here to a degree. It is true that 'no part of the (Red) river within Oklahoma is navigable.' Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 591\n, 42 S.Ct. 406, 413. Though appellant alleged that the stream is not now a navigable river of the United States, it has heretofore been authoritatively determined that in years past 'the usual head of navigation' was Lanesport, Arkansas, near the Oklahoma boundary. Id., 258 U.S. page 589, 42 S.Ct. page 412. At the present time commerce on the Red River is limited to the section below Alexandria, Louisiana, 122 miles above its mouth. \n27\n The fact that portions of a river are no longer used for commerce does not dilute the power of Congress over them. Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 123\n, 41 S.Ct. 409, 412; United States v. Appalachian Power Co., \n311 \nU.S. 377, 409\n, 410 S., 61 S.Ct. 291, 300. And it is clear that Congress may exercise its control over the non-navigable stretches of a river in order to preserve or promote commerce on the navigable portions. United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 703\n, 706 S., 708, 19 S.Ct. 770, 775-777; United States v. Utah, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 90\n, 51 S.Ct. 438, 446. It is obvious that at least incidentally Congress has done precisely that in this case. Congress was not unmindful of the effect of this project on the navigable capacity of the river. In authorizing it, Congress exercised all the power it possessed to control navigable waters. The Acts in question contain a declaration that one of their purposes is to improve navigation. And the Report clearly shows that the Denison Reservoir will have at least an incidental effect in protecting or improving the navigability of portions of the Red River. The District Engineer reported that 'Inasmuch as any new navigation system for the Red River would require flow regulation to furnish a dependable navigable improvement, the Denison \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 524]\n\u00a0\n Reservoir would be of considerable benefit.' \n28\n In his view it would decrease bank caving and silt carriage, substitute 'moderately high stages of long durations for high-flood stages of short duration', 'furnish more dependable naviga le stages especially in the upper portions of the navigation pools',29 and have a 'favorable effect on open-channel navigation by reducing flood stages and increasing low-water flows.' \n30\n The Division Engineer expressed the view that a 'dependable low-water flow of 2,200 to 3,000 cubic feet per second which would result from construction and operation of the power project at Denison would be of distinct benefit to the small commerce now developed upon those reaches of the lower Red River which are included in approved navigation projects, and might have a material bearing upon future studies of the Red River with a view to its further improvement. In the present state of knowledge upon this point, it is necessary to classify these benefits among the intangibles. But there is no doubt that a dependable low water supply would simplify, perhaps materially, such future development of the river as may be undertaken.' \n31\n Thus the effect on the river is tangible, though the value may be uncertain32 since it de- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 525]\n\u00a0\n pends in part on future action of Congress. But that is not our concern.\n We would, however, be less than frank if we failed to recognize this project as part of a comprehensive flood control program for the Mississippi itself. But there is no constitutional reason why Congress or the courts should be blind to the engineering prospects of protecting the nation's arteries of commerce through control of the watersheds. There is no constitutional reason why Congress cannot under the commerce power treat the watersheds as a key to flood control on navigable streams and their tributaries. Nor is there a constitutional necessity for viewing each reservoir project in isolation from a comprehensive plan covering the entire basin of a particular river. We need no survey to know that the Mississippi is a navigable river. We need no survey to know that the tributaries are generous contributors to the floods of the Mississippi. And it is common knowledge that Mississippi floods have paralyzed commerce 33 in the affected areas and have impaired navigation itself. We have recently recognized that 'Flood protection, watershed development, recovery of the cost of improvements through utilization of power are ... parts of commerce control.' United States v. Appalachian Power Co., supra, 311 U.S. page 426, 61 S.Ct. page 308. And we now add that the power of flood control extends to the tributaries of navigable streams. For just as control over the non-navigable parts of a river may be essential or desirable in the interests of the navigable portions, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 526]\n\u00a0\n so may the key to flood control on a navigable stream be found in whole or in part in flood control on its tributaries. As repeatedly recognized by this Court from McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, to United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. --, 132 A.L.R. 1430, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce may be aided by appropriate and needful control of activities and agencies which, though intrastate, affect that commerce.\n It is, of course, true that the extent to which this project will alleviate flood conditions in the lower Mississippi is somewhat conjectural. The District Engineer estimated that the Denison project would cause a reduction of 35,000 cubic feet per second in the lower Mississippi in case the May, 1908 flood were repeated; 8,000 cubic feet per second, in case of the May, 1935 flood; and 100,000 cubic feet per second, in case of the estimated maximum probable flood. \n34\n But the Division Engineer pointed out that 'the magnitude of the effect would depend upon the size and origin of the concurrent flood in Red River, and upon the basis of reservoir operation.' \n35\n In his view, a reduction in flow of 35,000 cubic feet per second in case of such a flood as 1908 'if long enough sustained, would imply a reduction in stage averaging 1.3 feet between Alexandria and Moncla, and a reduction of 0.15 foot in the flow lines of the Atchafalaya Basin and the main river below Old River, provided they were at peak stage. At lower stages the effect would be greater, but less necessary.' \n36\n This matter was again reviewed in the Definite Project and the following observations were made:37 'Floods in the Missis- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 527]\n\u00a0\n sippi River usually occur in the spring as a result of flood flows out of the Ohio River. The coincidence of flood flows out of the Red River with the Mississippi River spring floods is rare. However, the early summer floods out of the Missouri River occasionally coincide in the Mississippi River with the summer floods out of the Red River. The control provided by the proposed Denison Dam and Reservoir on the Red River summer floods has been estimated to produce a reduction of approximately 0.6 foot at the mouth of Old River on the Mississippi. This reduction, while not substantial with respect to Mississippi flood stages is important when flood crests seriously tax the Mississippi levee system.'\n Such matters raise not constitutional issues but questions of policy. They relate to the wisdom, need, and effectiveness of a particular project. They are therefore questions for the Congress not the courts. For us to inquire whether this reservoir will effect a substantial reduction in the lower Mississippi floods would be to exercise a legislative judgment based on a complexity of engineering data. It is for Congress alone to decide whether a particular project, by itself or as part of a more comprehensive scheme, will have such a beneficial effect on the arteries of interstate commerce as to warrant it. That determination is legislative in character. Cf. United States v. Appalachian Power Co., supra, 311 U.S. page 424, 61 S. Ct. page 307. The nature of the judgment involved is reemphasized if this project is viewed not in isolation but as part of a comprehensive, integrated reservoir system in the Mississippi River basin. A War Department survey in 1935 reveals promising engineering prospects in a system of 157 reservoirs38 throughout the tributaries of the Mississippi. To say that no one of those projects could be constitutionally authorized because its separate effect on floods in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 528]\n\u00a0\n the Mississippi would be too conjectural would be to deny the actual or potential aggregate benefits of the integrated system as a whole. That reveals the necessity from the constitutional viewpoint of leaving to Congress the decision as to what watersheds should be controlled (and what methods should be employed) in order to protect the various arteries of interstate commerce from the disasters of floods.\n Nor is it for us to determine whether the resulting benefits to commerce as a result of this particular exercise by Congress of the commerce power outweigh the costs of the undertaking. Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 456\n, 457 S., 51 S.Ct. 522, 526, 527; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 329\n, 330 S., 56 S.Ct. 466, 474, 475. Nor may we inquire into the motives of members of Congress who voted for this project in an endeavor to ascertain whether their concern over the great national loss from soil erosion, the enormous crop damages, the destruction of homes, the loss of life and other like ravages of floods overshadowed in their minds the desirability of protecting the Mississippi and other arteries of commerce. Arizona v. California, supra, 283 U.S. page 455, 51 S.Ct. page 526, and cases cited. It is sufficient for us that Congress has exercised its commerce power, though other purposes will also be served. Id., 283 U.S. page 456, 51 S.Ct. page 526\n\n\n But Oklahoma points out that the Denison Reservoir is a multiple purpose project,39 combining functionally and physically separate and unrelated purposes. It says that only the top 40 feet of the dam is set apart for flood control and that the lower portions of the dam are designed for the power project and are neither useful or necessary for flood control. It points out from the Report40 that a reservoir for flood control only would have \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 529]\n\u00a0\n a maximum height of 165 feet while a reservoir for flood control and power development would require a maximum height of 185 feet. It therefore earnestly contends that the additional 20 feet in height of the dam requires a very much greater acreage of appellant's domain than would a project for flood control only. And it insists that Congress is without authority to authorize a taking of Oklahoma's domain for the construction of the water power feature of the project.\n There are several answers to these contentions. We are not concerned here with the question as to the authority of the federal government to establish on a non-navigable stream a power project which has no relation to, or is not a part of, a flood control project. While this reservoir is a multiple purpose project, it is basically one for flood control. There is no indication that but for flood control it would have been projected. It originated as part of a comprehensive program for flood control. And the recommendation in the Report that a dual purpose dam be constructed was based 'on the assumption that the f ood-control project is to be built in any event.' \n41\n See United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 73\n, 33 S.Ct. 667, 676. Furthermore, it is plain from the Report that the construction of the project so as to accommodate power will increase or augment some of the flood control benefits, including river flow, which would accrue were the dam to be erected for flood control only. Thus, the District Engineer stated: 'If it were con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 530]\n\u00a0\n structed solely for flood control it would have beneficial effects in reducing floods, decreasing bank caving and silt carriage, and in substituting moderately high stages of long durations for high-flood stages of short duration. If the Denison Reservoir were constructed for the dual purposes of flood control and power development, these beneficent effects would be augmented by those resulting from the regulated power discharge which would increase low-water flows and furnish more dependable navigable stages especially in the upper portions of the navigation pools.' \n 42\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the power phase of this project in purpose and effect will carry some of the costs of flood control. The Division Engineer estimated that the annual deficit of $287,000 from flood control would be offset by an annual profit of $404,310 from power, leaving an annual net profit of $117,000.43 But the fact that Congress has introduced power development into this project as a paying partner44 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 531]\n\u00a0\n does not derogate from the authority of Congress to construct the dam for flood control, including river flow. The power project is not unrelated to those purposes. \n45\n The allocations of cost46 and storage between power and flood control, however significant for some purposes, cannot conceal the flood control realities of this total project. Cost of the power project, roughly speaking, was determined by the cost of the multiple purpose dam less the cost of a dam for flood control only. \n47\n On that basis the Report points out that the cost of storage for flood control only (5,800,000 acre- feet) is about $6.60 per acre-foot, while the cost of the 3,500,000 acre- feet in the so-called power pool is around $2 per acre-foot, exclusive of the cost of the powerhouse and appurtenant construction. \n48\n In this connection, the Definite Project states that the 'amount of storage which can be economically allocated to the production of power depends on the ability of the power market to absorb the power during the useful life of the project.' 49 But the Division Engineer observed that \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 532]\n\u00a0\n 'In actual operation of the dual-purpose project this cheap storage would be dedicated to flood control, whereas in the financial set-up it is credited to power.' \n50\n It is clear from the Report51 and the Definite Project that the bottom pool of dead storage is designed to take care of the deposit of silt 'which would otherwise reduce the efficiency and economic worth of the flood control storage.' \n52\n At the same time it will effectively provide waterpower head. And so far as the power storage is concerned, the Definite Project makes plain that it is functionally related to the broad objectives of flood control. The operation of the reservoir will involve a consideration of its multiple purposes. \n53\n Its operation in periods of drought so as to regularize the flow below the dam; 54 the reduction in reservoir outflow in case of floods down the valley; the increase of the outflow, in case of impending floods from above the dam, to the maximum 'bank full capacity downstream of the dam, so that the maximum amount of flood control storage will be available when the peak of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 533]\n\u00a0\n flood reaches the reservoir, thereby reducing the peak outflow of the reservoir to a minimum' 55-these are ample evidence that the power features and the flood control features of the dam, including river flow, are not unrelated. They demonstrate tha in operation of the dam the several functions will be interdependent and that the conflicts between the respective requirements of flood control and power development are here more apparent than real. \n56\n They show that this is nonetheless a flood control project which will 'fully control the maximum flood of record',57 though power, it is hoped, will pay the way. Whether the work of flood- control, including river flow, would be better done by a dam of one design or another is for Congress to determine. And, as we have said, the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 534]\n\u00a0\n fact that ends other than flood control will also be served, or that flood control may be relatively of lesser importance does not invalidate the exercise of the authority conferred on Congress.

United States v. Darby, supra, 312 U.S. page 124, 61 S.Ct. page 462, 85 L.Ed. --, 132 A.L.R. 1430, and cases cited. Since the construction of this dam and reservoir is a valid exercise by Congress of its commerce power, there is no interference with the sovereignty of the state. \n58\n United States v. Appalachian Power Co., supra, 311 U.S. page 428, 61 S.Ct. page 309. The fact that land is owned by a state is no barrier to its condemnation by the United States. Wayne County v. United States, 53 Ct.Cl. 417, affirmed \n252 \nU.S. 574\n, 40 S.Ct. 394. There is no complaint that any property owner will not receive just compensation for the land taken. The possible adverse effect on the tax revenues of Oklahoma as a result of the exercise by the federal government of its power of eminent domain is no barrier to the exercise of that power. 'Whenever the constitutional powers of the federal government and those of the state come into conflict, the latter must yield.' Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 47 S.Ct. 265, 266. Nor can a state call a halt to the exercise of the eminent domain power of the federal government because the subsequent flooding of the land taken will obliterate its boundary. And the suggestion that this project interferes with the state's own program for water development and conserva- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 508, 535]\n\u00a0\n tion is likewise of no avail. That program must bow before the 'superior power' of Congress. United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., supra, 174 U.S. page 703, 19 S.Ct. page 775; New Jersey v.

However, the combination of flood control and power development in the Denison Reservoir presents certain promise of favorable economic feasibility. Although this reservoir would approach economic justification if constructed exclusively for flood control, the income from power developed in conjunction with flood control would in part absorb this deficiency since the value of the available power would be somewhat in excess of its cost. It is apparent that the relative amounts of annual return, flood benefits, or power revenues, from each of the two functions of a dual-purpose development are quantitively dependent upon the manner in which storage potentialities of the site are apportioned between these two functions. It is believed, however, that an increased allocation of such storage to flood control at the expense of power would not materially alter the above conclusion exce t perhaps to show economic deficiencies for both phases of the development.' \n\n[\nFootnote 50\n] Report, p. 82. \n[\nFootnote 51\n] Id., pp. 45, 46. \n[\nFootnote 52\n] Definite Project, pp. 10-11, App.F., p. 5.

Since flood control is of great urgency in so many basins, one may appear to demolish all concept of wisdom in production of water power by the pat observation that an empty reservoir will not run turbines and a full reservoir will not catch floods. With respect to a particular reservoir, the observation is in point, but it is not thereby conclusive. That one reservoir might be reserved for flood control and another on the same stream used for power probably stumps no one. Neither should it stump anyone that part of a single reservoir be reserved for flood and part be used for power. Indeed, it would often cost less to provide flood-control space in the same reservoir with power space than to build a separate reservoir. And it should not be forgotten that storage to prevent the ordinarily low flow of dry seasons is itself flood prevention in that better sustained ordinary flow tends to maintain clear channels. If the conflict really were irreconcilable, we should be forced to abolish private water-power plants on every stream system requiring flood control. If private power and public flood control may harmonize, one may believe the same of public power and public flood control.'\n\n And see The Norris Project (1940), ch. 8. \n[\nFootnote 57\n] Report, p. 88. \n\n[\nFootnote 58\n] The government concedes that there will be no loss of political jurisdiction over the lands taken except with the consent of the state. Art. 1,  8, clause 17 of the Constitution. \n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUPERIOR BATH HOUSE CO. v. MCCARROLL(1941)\nNo. 180\nArgued: Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Mr. Terrell Marshall, of Little Rock, Ark., for appellant.\n Messrs. Frank Pace, Jr., and Lester M. Ponder, both of Little Rock, Ark., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a 1929 Act, Arkansas imposed a tax of 2% on the net income of domestic corporations 'with respect to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 176, 177]\n\u00a0\n carrying on or doing business' in the state. \n1\n Appellant, a corporation organized under Arkansas law, leases from the United States and operates for profit a bath house on the federal reservation at Hot Springs. Whether appellant is subject to the state tax depends on the interpretation of the language of a provision of a Congressional Act of 1891 and the corresponding provision of an Arkansas Act of 1903. The Congressional Act reads: 'The consent of the United States is hereby given for the taxation, under the authority of the laws of the State of Arkansas applicable to the equal taxation of personal property in that State, as personal property of all structures and other property in private ownership on the Hot Springs ( National Park) Reservation.' \n2\n The 1903 Arkansas act ceded to the United States exclusive jurisdiction over the business area of the reservation, reserving only the right to tax accorded by the 1891 Act and the right to serve criminal and civil process. \n3\n The Supreme Court of Arkansas held appellant liable for the tax,4 and the case is here on appeal, as authorized by 28 U.S.C.  344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 176, 178]\n\u00a0\n Arkansas does not contend, nor did the Supreme Court of that state hold, that appellant was liable for the state income tax under the general power of the state to tax corporations created pursuant to Arkansas law. On the contrary Arkansas admits that under the reciprocal state and federal acts the United States possesses complete sovereign power over the Hot Springs Reservation, subject to the right of the State of Arkansas to tax in accordance with the 1891 Act and subject to its right to execute within the reservation its civil and criminal process. The state does not claim a right of any kind to tax any corporation or individual doing business on the reservation unless the tax comes within the scope of its agreement with the government, effectuated by the 1891 and 1903 federal and state legislation. Since the state has taken this view, and since it is our opinion that the tax can be sustained on this basis, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether any other basis might conceivably exist.\n While not controlling here, it has been the consistent conviction of the Arkansas court that the federal legislation conferred broad powers of taxation upon the state. In Ex parte Gaines, 56 Ark. 227, 19 S.W. 602, decided one year after the original 1891 Act, the court held that a leasehold interest on the reservation was subject to state taxation. In Buckstaff Bath House Co. v. McKinley, 198 Ark. 91, 127 S.W.2d 802, 805,5 the court upheld the state unemployment compensation tax, saying of the 1891 Act: 'The Congress seemingly intended (and this construction is strengthened by the Gaines case) to permit \n\n[312 \nU.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n the State to exercise its sovereignty within the Reservation with respect to the conduct of business, commerce, and the professions, subject only to the interest retained by the Government and the right to enforce restrictions under the Federal laws ....'\n Appellant, however, reads the Act more narrowly than does the Arkansas court, and contends that the only taxes Arkansas can levy are ad valorem taxes imposed directly on tangible property. But the words tangible and ad valorem appear nowhere in the Act, nor do any synonymous words there appear. And in our opinion to construe the Act as though such words had been used would do violence to the intent of Congress. The language of Congress was peculiarly adapted to the broadening of the state's taxing power-not to its restriction. Thus, though under Arkansas law structures attached to land were considered a part of the realty, taxable or non-taxable with the land,6 Congress provided that privately owned structures on the tax exempt land of the reservation should be taxed 'as personal property.' Not only was this done, but also all 'other property in private ownership' was expressly made subject to state taxation. By these provisions Congress manifested its purpose that no type of privately owned property should escape the state's taxing power merely because it was owned or used on the reservation.\n And appellant's insistence that these provisions permit only ad valorem taxation loses sight of the fact that the word property is by no means limited, in all its variations, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n to actual tangible physical things. \n7\n Its meaning must be determined from its context as illumined by the subject treated and the objectives sought. It is true that Arkansas had no corporate income tax in 1891, when the original permission to tax was granted. But taxation policies and systems change with necessities and experience, and no support can be found in the Act for a belief that Congress consented to state taxation only if Arkansas would make its 1891 tax system static. If we accept appellant's premise that what Congress consented to was ad valorem taxation only, we must conclude that Congress consented to a tax under which Arkansas was collecting virtually all of its revenues in 1891. Since 1900, state governments-Arkansas included-have tended to secure less and less of their revenue from ad valorem taxation, and more and more from taxes of other types. \n8\n The Arkansas legislature, in fact, in the preamble to the 1929 income tax act, gave as a reason for its adoption that 'Agricultural and Industrial development is now being retarded because of a policy to secure practically all of the Revenue from an Ad valorem Tax, thus penalizing and discouraging ownership of property ....'9 The narrow construction of the Act urged by appellant-a corporation created under the laws of Arkansas- would thus relieve it from an Arkansas tax on corporate income enacted, at least in part, as a substitute for those state ad valorem taxes to which appellant admits it is subject. And 'The privilege of use is only one attribute, among many, of the bundle of privi- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n leges that make up property or ownership.' \n10\n It is our opinion that the decision below must be affirmed. \n11\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, concurring.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and I concur in the judgment of the Court but upon different grounds from those stated in its opinion.\n The state court has held that so far as the state constitution and laws are involved it has power to lay the present tax. It is no concern of ours what reasons are assigned for that conclusion. The only question for decision here is whether there is anything in the acts of Congress establishing the reservation or in the relationship of the two sovereignties, state and national, to prevent the state from laying a tax on the net income of its own corporation.\n If the consent of the national government were needful in order to sustain the present tax we should have difficulty in finding that consent in the words of the Act of Congress authorizing the state to tax 'all structures and other property in private ownership on the ... (National Park) Reservation'. But we think that such consent is unnecessary to enable a state to tax the income of its own corporations, derived from property located on the reservation. It is enough that no Act of Congress and no agreement by the state with the Federal Government prohibits the tax.\n The fact that income-producing property is physically located on the territory of another sovereignty does not foreclose the state from taxing its own residents and corporations on the income derived from the property. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 108 A.L.R. 721; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374; see Newark Fire Insurance Co. v. State Board, \n307 \nU.S. 313\n, 59 S.Ct. 918. We have recently held that such a tax is not a tax on the income-producing property in any such sense as to preclude the tax for want of 'jurisdiction' of the state to lay it. Cohn v. Graves, supra, 300 U.S. at pages 313, 314, 57 S.Ct. at pages 467, 468, 108 A.L.R. 721; Graves v. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466, 480\n, 59 S.Ct. 595, 598, 120 A.L.R. 1466. There is no occasion now to give renewed currency to the notion erroneously attributed to Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S.Ct. 673; cf. Cohn v. Graves, supra, 300 U.S. at pages 314, 315, 57 S.Ct. at pages 468, 108 A.L.R. 721, that a tax on income is subject to the limitations of a tax on the property which produces it.\n For that reason if Arkansas had made an unrestricted grant of the reservation it could not be said to have renounced its authority to tax income of its corporations or citizens derived from property on the reservation, more than if it were located in the District of Columbia or in another state. It clearly has not done so by reserving the right to lay a property tax within the reservation or by agreeing that the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over it for any or for every purpose. The state's power to lay the tax, being independent of its jurisdiction over the ceded territory, subsists unless waived or prohibited by competent authority.\n Whatever constitutional power the federal government may have to prohibit the state taxation of income derived from property located on the reservation, regarded as a federal instrumentality, it is plain that it has not assumed to exercise the power. Graves v. O'Keefe, supra, 306 U.S. at page 480, 59 S.Ct. at page 598, 120 A.L.R. 1466. Since the state has not surrendered its constitutional power to tax the income and since Congress has not assumed in the act establishing the reservation, or otherwise, to prohibit the tax, the power of the state is unimpaired, unless restricted by its own constitution and laws.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER while agreeing with the Court's opinion also agrees with the view expressed in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ark.Acts (1929) No. 118. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 26 Stat. 844, 16 U.S.C.A.  365.

Kochersperger, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents two problems: (1) whether a Circuit Court of Appeals may be composed of all the circuit judges of the circuit in active service, more than three in number, sitting en banc; (2) whether petitioner may deduct under the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 345 et seq., certain expenses incurred by it under contracts in connection with the presentation of claims to Congress on behalf of former enemy aliens for the procurement and enactment of amendatory legislation authorizing the payment of the claims. We granted the petition for certiorari because of the public importance of the first problem and the contrariety of the views of the court below (3 Cir., 117 F. 2d 62) and judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ( Lang's Estate v. Commissioner, 97 F.2d 867) as respects its solution.\n First: There are five circuit judges,1 in active service,2 of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. All five heard and decided this case. Though they divided three to two on the deductibility of the expenses in question, they were unanimous in the conclusion that five were authorized to hear and decide the case. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 328]\n\u00a0\n The problem arises because  117 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  212, 28 U.S.C.A.  212, 36 Stat. 1131, provides that 'There shall be in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which shall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum, which shall be a court of record, with appellate jurisdiction, as hereinafter limited and established.' That provision derives from  2 of the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, which established the circuit court of appeals. \n4\n Though Congress by that Act created these new courts, it did not make provision for the appointment to them of a new group of judges. It provided, however, by  3 of that Act that the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court assigned to each circuit and the circuit judges and district judges within each circuit 'shall be competent to sit as judges of the circuit court of appeals within their respective circuits.' Thus it is apparent that the newly created circuit court of appeals was to be composed of only three judges5 who were to be \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n drawn from the three existing groups of judges-the circuit justice, the circuit judges, and the district judges.\n That arrangement continued until enactment of the Judicial Code. Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087. The Judicial Code abolished the existing circuit courts.  289, 297. It carried over into  117 without substantial change the provision of  2 of the Act of March 3, 1891 that there should be a circuit court of appeals in each circuit 'which shall consist of three judges'. Though this section was said merely to represent existing law,6  118 of the Judicial Code provided for four circuit judges in the Second, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits, two in the Fourth Circuit, and three in each of the others. An anomalous situation was presented if  117 were to be taken at that juncture as meaning that the circuit court of appeals would continue to be composed of only three, in face of the fact there were more than three circuit judges in some circuits. Though  3 of the Act of March 3, 1891, made the circuit judges 'competent to sit as judges of the circuit court of appeals within their respective circuits',  120 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  216, into which the provisions of  3 were carried eliminated the circuit judges from the groups of judges 'competent to sit'. Yet it retained the provision that the circuit justices and the district judges were so qualified. We agree, however, with the view of the court below that the circuit judges became ex officio judges of the respective circuit courts of appeal when the circuit courts were abolished. Though  120 did not designate them as 'competent to sit', its other provisions made clear that they were intended to sit. Thus, it was provided that the district judges should be drawn upon only in case the court could not be made up by the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n circuit justices and the circuit judges. \n7\n Yet if  117 were to be read literally, the circuit court of appeals was to 'consist' of only three judges in spite of the fact that Congress had already provided in some circuits for more than three circuit judges. Clearly where there were four, all could not be members of a court of three. Yet there was plainly inferable a Congressional purpose to constitute in some circuits a circuit court of appeals of four judges. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Any doubts on that score9 were resolved by the Act of January 13, 1912, c. 9, 37 Stat. 52, 28 U.S.C.A.  213, which amended  118 of the Judicial Code by the addition of the provision that 'The circuit judges in each circuit shall be judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit, and it shall be the duty of each circuit judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law.' Senator Sutherland who had charge of the bill in the Senate stated on the floor: 'It makes no change whatever in the existing law except to make it clear that the circuit judges in the various circuits of the United States shall constitute the circuit \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 331]\n\u00a0\n court of appeals.' \n10\n The purpose seems plain: the size of each circuit court of appeals was not to be less than the number of circuit judges authorized by law. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n And so we reach the question as to whether the avowed purpose of  118 was defeated by  117. We do not think it was.\n That purpose was not thwarted by the provision in the 1912 amendment to  118 that 'it shall be the duty of each circuit judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law.' It has been suggested that 'ac- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 332]\n\u00a0\n cording to law' refers to  117. In our view, however, it is the time of the sitting which is to be 'according to law'. Hence the reference must be to  126 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  223, 28 U.S.C.A.  223, which regulates the times when the circuit courts of appeal shall sit.\n If  117 could reasonably be construed to provide that the court, when sitting, should consist of three judges drawn from a panel of such larger number as might from time to time be authorized, reconciliation with  118 would be obvious. Sec. 117, however, contains no such qualification. And since it establishes the court as a 'court of record, with appellate jurisdiction', it cannot readily be inferred that the provision for three judges is a limitation only on the number who may hear and decide a case. There are numerous functions of the court, as a 'court of record, with appellate jurisdiction', other than hearing and deciding appeals. Under the Judicial Code these embrace prescribing the form of writs and other process and the form and style of its seal ( 122, 28 U.S. C.A.  219); the making of rules and regulations ( 122); the appointment of a clerk ( 124, 28 U.S.C.A.  221) and the approval of the appointment and removal of deputy clerks ( 125, 28 U.S.C.A.  222); and the fixing of the 'times' when court shall be held.  126. Furthermore, those various sections of the Judicial Code provide that each of these functions shall be performed by the 'court'. In that connection it should be noted that most of them derive, as does  117, from  2 of the Act of March 3, 1891. The first sentence of  2 provided that the court 'shall consist of three judges'. The next sentence stated that 'Such court shall prescribe the form and style of its seal and the form of writs and other process and procedure', etc. In that setting it is difficult to perceive how the word 'court' in the second sentence was used in a different sense than in the preceding sentence. And we look in vain for any indication12 that when those separate sentences were \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n sectionalized in the Code, they acquired a meaning which they did not have in  2 of the Act of March 3, 1891\n\n\n We cannot conclude, however, that the word 'court' as used in those other provisions of the Judicial Code means only three judges. That would not only produce a most awkward situation; it would on all matters disenfranchise some circuit judges against the clear intendment of  118. Nor can we conclude that the word 'court' means only three judges when the court is sitting, but all the judges when other functions are performed. Certainly there is no specific authority for that construction. And it is difficult to reach that conclusion by inference. For to do so would be to imply that Congress prohibited some circuit judges from participation in the most important function of the 'court' (the hearing and the decision of appeals), though allowing all of them to perform the other functions. Such a prohibition as respects the ordinary responsibilities of a judicial office should be inferred only under compelling necessity, since a court usually will consist of all the judges appointed to it. That necessity is not present here. The ambiguity in the statute is doubtless the product of inadvertence. Though the problem of construction is beset with difficulties, the conclusion that  117 provides merely the permissible complement of judges for a circuit court of appeals results in greater harmony in the statutory scheme13 than if the language of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 334]\n\u00a0\n s 117 is taken too literally. And any sacrifice of literalness for common sense does no violence to the history of  117. That history is largely negative in the sense that there is no clear statement by sponsors of this legislation that  118 read in light of  117 prevents the conclusion which we have reached. \n14\n Certainly the result reached makes for \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 335]\n\u00a0\n more effective judicial administration. 15 Conflicts within a circuit will be avoided. Finality of decision in the circuit courts of appeal will be promoted. Those considerations are especially important in view of the fact that in our federal judicial system these courts are the courts of last resort in the run of ordinary cases. Such considerations are, of course, not for us to weigh in case Congress has devised a system where the judges of a court are prohibited from sitting en banc. But where, as here, the case on the statute is not foreclosed, they aid in tipping the scales in favor of the more practicable interpretation.\n Second: The expenses in question are sought to be deducted as 'ordinary and necessary expenses' within the meaning of  23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 356. Petitioner, a Delaware corporation, was employed to represent certain German textile interests, whose properties in this \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 336]\n\u00a0\n country had been seized during the World War under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 40 Stat. 411, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  1 et seq. Petitioner's employment was made with a view towards procuring legislation which would permit ultimate recovery of the properties. The estimated aggregate value of the properties was $60,000,000. Petitioner was to be compensated on a percentage basis in case it was successful. It, however, was to bear all the costs and expenses. Petitioner launched its campaign. A publicist was retained to arrange for speeches, news items, and editorial comment. Two legal experts were retained to prepare propaganda concerning international relations, treaty rights and the policy of this nation as respects alien property in time of war. The objective of the campaign was accomplished by the passage of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 254, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  9 et seq. Deductions for the amount paid to the publicist and the two lawyers were taken in 1929 and 1930, thereby producing a net loss in each of those years. Pursuant to  117 of the 1928 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 388, the net loss was carried forward two years and applied against income for 1931. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions and determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals disagreed, holding that there was no deficiency. 38 B. T.A. 623. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board. were not deductible. Art. 262 of wee not deductible. Art. 262 of Treasury Regulations 74, promulgated under the 1928 Act was entitled 'Donations by corporations' and provided:\n'Corporations are not entitled to deduct from gross income contributions or gifts which individuals may deduct under section 23(n). Donations made by a corporation for purposes connected with the operation of its business, however, when limited to charitable institutions, hospitals, or educational institutions conducted for the benefit of its employees or their dependents are a proper \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 337]\n\u00a0\n deduction as ordinary and necessary expenses. Donations which legitimately represent a consideration for a benefit flowing directly to the corporation as an incident of its business are allowable deductions from gross income. For example, a street railway corporation may donate a sum of money to an organization intending to hold a convention in the city in which it operates, with the reasonable expectation that the holding of such convention will augment its income through a greater number of people using the cars. Sums of money expended for lobbying purposes, the promotion or defeat of legislation, the exploitation of propaganda, including advertising other than trade advertising, and contributions for campaign expenses, are not deductible from gross income.'\n\n If this is a valid and applicable regulation, the sums in question were not deductible as 'ordinary and necessary expenses' under  23(a), since they clearly run afoul of the prohibition in the last sentence of the regulation.\n Plainly, the regulation was applicable. The ban against deductions of amounts spent for 'lobbying' as 'ordinary and necessary' expenses of a corporation derived from a Treasury Decision in 1915. T.D. 2137, 17 Treas. Dec., Int.Rev., pp. 48, 57, 58. That prohibition was carried into Art. 143 of Treasury Regulations 33 (Revised, 1918) under the heading of 'Expenses' in the section on 'Deductions'.16 Beginning in 1921 the regulation was entitled 'Donations.' (Art. 562, Treasury Regulations 45.) And in the regulations here in question Art. 262 appeared under  23(n) which covered 'Charitable and other contribu- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 338]\n\u00a0\n tions' by individuals. It assumed that form and content in 1921 and appeared since then without change in all successive regulations. \n17\n Sec. 23(n) and  23(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 356, 358, both deal with deductions; and a 'donation' by a corporation though not deductible under the former might be under the latter. Art. 262 purports to specify when a certain type of expenditure or donation by a corporation may or may not be deducted as an 'ordinary and necessary' expense. The argument that it was not applicable because it was not specifically incorporated under  23(a) is frivolous.\n Petitioner's argument that the regulation is invalid likewise lacks substance. The words 'ordinary and necessary' are not so clear and unambiguous in their meaning and application as to leave no room for an interpretative regulation. The numerous cases which have come to this Court on that issue bear witness to that. Welch v. Helvering, \n290 \nU.S. 111\n, 54 S.Ct. 8; Deputy v. Du Pont, \n308 \nU.S. 488\n, 60 S.Ct. 363, and cases cited. Nor has the administrative agency usurped the legislative function by carving out this special group of expenses and making them non-deductible. We fail to find any indication that such a course contravened any Congressional policy. \n18\n Contracts to spread such insidious influences through legislative halls have long been condemned. Trist v. Child, 21 Wall. 441; Hazelton v. Sheckells, \n202 \nU.S. 71\n, 26 S.Ct. 567, 6 Ann.Cas. 217. Whether the precise arrangement here in question would violate the rule of those cases is not \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 339]\n\u00a0\n material. The point is that the general policy indicated by those cases need not be disregarded by the rule-making authority in its segregation of non-deductible expenses. There is no reason why, in absence of clear Congressional action to the contrary, the rule-making authority cannot employ that general policy in drawing a line between legitimate business expenses and those arising from that family of contracts to which the law has given no sanction. The exclusion of the latter from 'ordinary and necessary' expenses certainly does no violence to the statutory language. The general policy being clear it is not for us to say that the line was too strictly drawn.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judicial Code  118, 28 U.S.C.  213, 28 U.S.C.A.  213; Act of June 10, 1930, c. 438, 46 Stat. 538, 28 U.S.C.  213d, 28 U.S.C.A.  213d; Act of June 24, 1936, c. 753, 49 Stat. 1903, 28 U.S.C.  213d-1, 28 U.S.C.

Rule 4(1) provides: 'The court consists of the circuit justice, when in attendance, and of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in active service. District judges and retired circuit judges of the circuit sit in the court when specially designated or assigned as provided by law. Three judges shall sit in the court to hear all matters, except those which the court by special order directs to be heard by the court en banc.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sec. 2 provided in part: 'That there is hereby created in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which shall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum, and which shall be a court of record with appellate jurisdiction, as is hereafter limited and established.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Sec. 3 of that Act provided: 'In case the full court at any time shall not be made up by the attendance of the Chief-Justice or an associate justice of the Supreme Court and circuit judges, one or more district judges within the circuit shall be competent to sit in the court according to such order or provision among the district judges as either by general or particular assignment shall be designated by the court ....' And it should be noted that after the passage of the Act of March 3, 1891, there were three circuit judges in the Second Circuit and two in each of the others. Act of April 10, 1869, c. 22,  2, 16 Stat. 44; Act of March 3, 1887, c. 347, 24 Stat. 492; Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,  1, 26 Stat. 826. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] S.Rep.No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 1, p. 49, Pt. 2, p. 310. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 'In case the Chief Justice or an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall attend at any session of the circuit court of appeals, he shall preside.

In case the full court at any time shall not be made up by the attendance of the Chief Justice or the associate justice, and the circuit judges, one or more district judges within the circuit shall sit in the court according to such order or provision among the district judges as either by general or particular assignment shall be designated by the court. ...' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Thus the Senate Report, supra note 6, in speaking of  118 ( 116 in the bill) stated, p. 50: '... the section states in concise language the number of judges now provided by law for the several judicial circuits.' \n[\nFootnote 9\n] See the letter by Albert H. Walker in 74 Central L.J. 12. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 47 Cong.Rec., Pt. 3, p. 2736. Senator Sutherland also said: 'It has been thought, as I said, that the existing law did not make it quite clear that the circuit judges shall be the constituent members of the circuit court of appeals, and it is to remove that doubt, and that only, that this bill has been reported from the Judiciary Committee.' Id., p. 2736. H.Rep.No. 199, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., stated, 'This bill deals with a defect in existing law. It makes it clear that the circuit judges shall constitute the circuit court of appeals.' And see the statements on the floor of the House by Representative Clayton, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (48 Cong.Rec., Pt. 1, p. 667) and Representative Moon, chairman of the House Committee on the Revisions of the Laws, who had been in charge of the House bill providing for the Judicial Code. Id., p. 668.\n Possible inferences looking the other way are such statements by Representative Mann that 'in those circuits where there were four circuit judges, one of them might be put at work in the district court.' 48 Cong. Rec., Pt. 1, p. 667. And see 48 Cong.Rec., Pt. 2, p. 1272. Yet such statements are not inconsistent with the conclusion that while the ordinary complement of circuit judges would be three, all might sit. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] In this connection it should be noted that  120 of the Judicial Code makes the 'Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court assigned to each circuit ... competent to sit as judges of the circuit court of appeals within their respective circuits.' Thus while the circuit court of appeals is composed primarily of circuit judges, the circuit justice is made a 'component part' of that court. See statement by Representative Moon, op. cit., supra, note 10, p. 668. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Sec. 122 of the Judicial Code ( 120 in the bill) giving the court power to prescribe the form of writs and other process and the form and style of its seal, and the power to make rules and regulations was stated in S. Rep. No. 388, supra, note 6, p. 51, to represent 'existing law'. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] \n\n[314 \nU.S. 326, 7]\n\u00a0\n It is suggested by respondent that if the Circuit Court of Appeals may sit en banc, difficulties arise in connection with that provision of  120 of the Judicial Code which reads: 'In case the full court at any time shall not be made up by the attendance of the Chief Justice or the associate justice, and the circuit judges, one or more district judges within the circuit shall sit in the court according to such order or provision among the district judges as either by general or particular assignment shall be designated by the court. ...' The difficulty suggested is that  120 would imply that, if all the circuit judges compose the 'court', then district judges should be called in whenever the court was composed of less than that number. And the argument goes further and suggests that since the circuit Justice is 'competent to sit' (see note 11, supra) then a district court judge could be brought in, when the circuit justice is absent, to make up the 'full court' even though all circuit judges sat. The answer, however, is that 'full court' as used in  120 refers to the court which contains the permissible complement of judges as distinguished from a quorum of two. Under our interpretation a bench of three judges is the permissible complement under  117. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Beginning in 1938 the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges recommended an amendment to the Code which would enable a majority of the circuit judges in circuits where there were more than three to provide for a court of more than three judges. Report of the Attorney General (1938) p. 23; id. (1939) pp. 15-16; Report of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges (1940) p. 7. A bill was introduced during the present session of Congress in both the House (H.R. 3390) and the Senate (S. 1053) to amend  117 of the Judicial Code by adding thereto the following: 'Provided, That, in a circuit where there are more than three circuit judges, the majority of the circuit judges may provide for a court of all the active and available circuit judges of the circuit to sit in banc for the hearing of particular cases, when in their opinion such action is advisable.'\n This bill has passed the House. 87 Cong.Rec. 8328. In the House, the Committee on the Judiciary reported the bill favorably (H.Rep.No. 1246, 77th Cong., 1st Sess.) stating:\n'Under existing law provision is made that there shall be in each circuit a circuit court of appeals which shall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum. The bill adds a provision that in a circuit where there are more than three circuit judges, the majority of the circuit judges may provide for a court of all the active and available circuit judges of the circuit to sit in banc for the hearing of particular cases, when in their opinion such action is advisable.\n\n'If the court can sit in banc the situation where two three-judge courts may reach conflicting conclusions is obviated. It also will obviate the situation where there are seven members of the court and as sometimes happens a decision of two judges (there having been a dissent) sets the precedent for the remaining judges. A similar result would be avoided with a court of five judges.\n\n'It seems desirable that where the judges feel it advisable they might sit in banc for hearing particular cases. Legislation to this effect has been recommended by the judicial conference of senior circuit judges since 1938, and at its January 1941 session the conference approved the form of the present bill.'\n\n But we do not deduce that this effort at clarification was or purported to be any definitive interpretation that  117 as it stands prohibits a circuit court of appeals of more than three judges from sitting en banc. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See H.Rep.No. 1246, supra, note 14; 69 Central L.J. 217.

He alleged that in 1924 the company issued him a life insurance policy providing for monthly disability benefits and for the waiver of premiums during disability; that he became disabled in April, 1933, and that the defendant fraudulently concealed the disability provisions from him; that the defendant unlawfully cancelled the policy for nonpayment of premiums; that in September, 1935, he discovered the existence of the disability provisions; that he then applied to the company for reinstatement of the policy and for the payment of disability benefits, and that the company refused. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 127]\n\u00a0\n The suit was removed to the federal District Court for the Western District of Missouri, the plaintiff being a citizen of Missouri, the defendant a New York corporation, and the amount in controversy exceeding $ 3,000. All of the material allegations of the bill were denied. The district court dismissed the bill, finding that there was no fraud on the defendant's part and that the plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the policy. No appeal was taken.\n In 1937, an action at law was brought against the insurance company in the Missouri state court by one Shay, a resident of the District of Columbia. He alleged that he was Toucey's assignee and that Toucey's disability entitled him to judgment. It does not appear that the insurance company filed an answer or any other pleading. Instead, a 'supplemental bill' was filed in the Western District of Missouri, setting forth the history of the litigation between the parties, alleging that the assignment to Shay was made in order to avoid federal jurisdiction, and praying that Toucey be enjoined from bringing any suit for the purpose of readjudicating the issues settled by the federal decree and from further prosecuting the Shay suit.\n A preliminary injunction was granted and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 102 F.2d 16, 122 A.L.R. 1415. The court held that Toucey's claim in the prior suit rested upon proof of his disability, and that this issue, necessarily involved in the Shay proceeding, had been conclusively determined in the insurance company's favor. Section 265 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1162, 28 U.S.C.  379, 28 U.S.C.A.  379, was construed not to deprive a federal court of the power to enjoin state court proceedings where an injunction is 'necessary to preserve to litigants the fruits of, or to effectuate the lawful decrees of the federal courts'. Certiorari was denied, \n307 \nU.S. 638\n, 59 S. Ct. 1037, and the injunction was made permanent. Toucey \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 128]\n\u00a0\n appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals again affirmed, 112 F.2d 927. In view of the importance of the questions presented, we granted certiorari. \n311 \nU.S. 643\n, 61 S.Ct. 440. The decision below was affirmed by an equally divided Court, \n313 \nU.S. 538\n, 61 S.Ct. 833, and the case is now before us on rehearing, \n313 \nU.S. 596\n, 61 S.Ct. 938.\n No. 19. The Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Company, a Delaware corporation, in 1932 executed a deed of trust conveying all of its property, principally a bridge across the Mississippi River between Iowa and Wisconsin, to secure a $200,000 bond issue. In 1933, the trustees, an Iowa corporation and a Wisconsin citizen, filed a bill of foreclosure in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. One of the Bridge Company's stockholders intervened as a party defendant, alleging that the bonds and mortgage were fraudulent and without consideration. Upon his motion, the Phoenix Finance Corporation, a Delaware corporation which held almost 90% of the bonds, was joined as a plaintiff. The Bridge Company's answer challenged the validity of the indenture and alleged that the bonds were issued without consideration. Phoenix denied all allegations of fraud.\n The case was tried before a master, whose modified conclusions were adopted by the court. Finding that the mortgage and bonds were fraudulently issued and that almost all the bonds were without consideration, the court denied foreclosure. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, First Trust & Savings Bank v. Iowa- Wisconsin Bridge Co., 98 F.2d 416, and certiorari was denied Phoenix Finance Corp. v. Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Co., \n305 \nU.S. 650\n, 59 S.Ct. 243.\n Phoenix thereafter instituted five separate suits against the Bridge Company in the Delaware state courts, seeking recovery on various notes and contracts claimed to have constituted the consideration for the bonds. The Bridge Company thereupon filed a 'supplemental bill' in the Northern District of Iowa, asserting that the issues involved in the state court suits had been made res \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 129]\n\u00a0\n judicata by the federal decree, and praying, inter alia, that Phoenix be enjoined from further prosecuting the state suits. (In one of the suits, the state court rejected the res judicata plea, Phoenix Finance Corp. v. Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Co., 1 Terry, Del., 500, 14 A.2d 386, and an appeal is now pending in the Supreme Court of Delaware.) The district court found that Phoenix was bound by the former decree, and that the prohibition of  265 was no bar to an injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 8 Cir., 115 F.2d 1, and because of the relation of the questions presented to those in No. 16, we brought the case here. \n312 \nU.S. 670\n, 61 S.Ct. 550.\n The courts below have thus decided that the previous federal judgments are res judicata in the state proceedings, and that therefore, notwithstanding the prohibitory provisions of  265, the federal courts may use their injunctive powers to save the defendants in the state proceedings the inconvenience of pleading and proving res judicata. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n First. Section 265-'a limitation of the power of the federal courts dating almost from the beginning of our history and expressing an important Congressional policy-to prevent needless friction between state and federal courts', Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., \n309 \nU.S. 4, 8\n, 9 S., 60 S.Ct. 215, 217, 218-is derived from  5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 335: '... nor shall a writ of injunction be granted (by any court of the United States) to stay proceedings in any court of a state ....' In its present form, 36 Stat. 1162, 28 U.S.C.  379, 28 U.S.C.A.  379, the provision reads as follows: 'The writ of injunction shall not be \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 130]\n\u00a0\n granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy'.2\n The history of this provision in the Judiciary Act of 1793 is not fully known. We know that on December 31, 1790, Attorney General Edmund Randolph reported to the House of Representatives on desirable changes in the Judiciary Act of 1789. Am.State Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 17, pp. 21- 36. The most serious question raised by Randolph concerned the arduousness of the circuit duties imposed on the Supreme Court justices. But the Report also suggested a number of amendments dealing with procedural matters. A section of the proposed bill submitted by him provided that 'no injunction in equity shall be granted by a district court to a judgment at law of a State court.' Id., p. 26. Randolph explained that this clause 'will debar the district court from interfering with the judgments at law in the State courts; for if the plaintiff and defendant rely upon the State courts, as far as the judgment, they ought to continue there as they have begun. It is enough to split the same suit into one at law, and another in equity, without adding a further separation, by throwing the common law side of the question into the State courts, and the equity side into the federal courts'. Id., p. 34. The Report was considered by the House sitting as a Committee of the Whole, and then was referred to successive special committees for further consideration. No action was taken until after Chief Justice Jay and his associates wrote the President that their cir- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 131]\n\u00a0\n cuit-riding duties were too burdensome. American State Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 32, p. 51. In response to this complaint, which was transmitted to Congress, the Act of March 2, 1793, was passed, containing in  5, inter alia, the prohibition against staying state court proceedings.\n Charles Warren in his article Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345, 347, suggests that this provision was the direct consequence of Randolph's report. This seems doubtful, in view of the very narrow purpose of Randolph's proposal, namely, that federal courts of equity should not interfere with the enforcement of judgments at law rendered in the state courts. See Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L.J. 1169, 1171, n. 14.\n There is no record of any debates over the statute. See 3 Annals of Congress (1791-93). It has been suggested that the provision reflected the then strong feeling against the unwarranted intrusion of federal courts upon state sovereignty. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, was decided on February 18, 1793, less than two weeks before the provision was enacted into law. The significance of this proximity is doubtful. Compare Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345, 347-48 with Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 273, 291\n, 292 S., 26 S.Ct. 252, 259. Much more probable is the suggestion that the provision reflected the prevailing prejudices against equity jurisdiction. The Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.), chronicling the proceedings of the Senate while he was one of its members (1789-1791), contains abundant evidence of a widespread hostility to chancery practice. See especially, pp. 92-94, 101-06 (debate on the bill that became Judiciary Act of 1789). Moreover, Senator Ellsworth (soon to become Chief Justice of the United States), the principal draftsman of both the 1789 and 1793 Judiciary Acts, often indicated a dislike for equity jurisdiction. See Brown, Life of Oliver Ellsworth (1905 ed.) 194; Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.) 103- 04; Warren, New \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 132]\n\u00a0\n Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv.L.Rev. 49, 96-100.3\n Regardless of the various influences which shaped the enactment of  5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, the purpose and direction underlying the provision is manifest from its terms: proceedings in the state courts should be free from interference by federal injunction. The provision expresses on its face the duty of 'hands off' by the federal courts in the use of the injunction to stay litigation in a state court. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The language of the Act of 1793 was unqualified: '... nor shall a writ of injunction be granted to stay proceedings in any court of a state ....' 1 Stat. 335. In the course of one hundred and fifty years, Congress has made few withdrawals from this sweeping prohibition:\n\n\n (1)\n Bankruptcy proceedings. This is the only legislative exception which has been incorporated directly into Section 265: '... except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy'. 36 Stat. 1162. This provision, based upon  21 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 526, was inserted in the Act of 1793 by the Revisors. R.S.  720; \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 133]\n\u00a0\n see Proposed Draft of Revision of U.S. Statutes (1872), vol. 1, p. 418.\n\n\n (2)\n Removal of actions. The Removal Acts, ever since the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 79, have provided that whenever any party entitled to remove a suit shall file with the state court a proper petition for removal and a bond with good and sufficient surety, it shall then be the duty of the state court to accept such petition and bond 'and proceed no further in the cause'. Section 265 has always been deemed inapplicable to removal proceedings. Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, \n103 \nU.S. 494\n; Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co., \n196 \nU.S. 239\n, 25 S.Ct. 251. The true rationale of these decisions is that the Removal Acts qualify pro tanto the Act of 1793. Subsequent decisions have clarified the loose ground advanced in French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 253, note. See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077; Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L.J. 1169, 1174-75; compare Bryant v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 2 Cir., 92 F.2d 569, 571.\n\n\n (3)\n Limitation of shipowners' liability. The Act of 1851 limiting the liability of shipowners provides that after a shipowner transfers his interest in the vessel to a trustee for the benefit of the claimants, 'all claims and proceedings against the owner or owners shall cease.' 9 Stat. 635, 636. Being a 'subsequent statute' to the Act of 1793, this provision operates as an implied legislative amendment to it. Providence & N.Y.S.S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 578, 599\n, 3 S.Ct. 379, 392, 617; see Admiralty Rule 51, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, 254 U.S., appendix, p. 26.\n\n\n (4)\n Interpleader. The Interpleader Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 416, amended the 1917 Interpleader Act, 39 Stat. 929, to provide as follows: 'Notwithstanding any provision of the Judicial Code to the contrary, said ( district) court shall have power to issue its process for all such claimants and to issue an order of injunction against each of them, enjoining them from instituting or prose- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 134]\n\u00a0\n cuting any suit or proceeding in any State court or in any other Federal court ....' See Dugas v. American Surety Co., \n300 \nU.S. 414, 428\n, 57 S.Ct. 515, 521; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., \n308 \nU.S. 66, 74\n, 60 S.Ct. 44, 48.\n\n\n (5)\n Frazier-Lemke Act. The filing of a petition for relief under this Act subjects the farmer and his property, wherever located, to the 'exclusive jurisdiction' of the federal court. And except with the consent of the court, specified proceedings against the farmer or his property 'shall not be instituted, or if instituted at any time prior to the filing of a petition under this section, shall not be maintained, in any court ....' 47 Stat. 1473. See Kalb v. Feuerstein, \n308 \nU.S. 433\n, 60 S.Ct. 343.\n Third. This brings us to applications of  265 apart from these statutory qualifications. The early decisions of this Court applied the Act of 1793 as a matter of course. \n5\n However, a line of cases beginning with Hagan \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 135]\n\u00a0\n v. Lucas, 10 Pet. 400, holds that the court, whether federal or state, which first takes possession of a res withdraws the property from the reach of the other. Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 597; Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450. See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 235\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 83, 24 A.L. R. 1077: 'The rank and authority of the (federal and state) courts are equal, but both courts cannot possess or control the same thing at the same time, and any attempt to do so would result in unseemly conflict. The rule, therefore, that the court first acquiring jurisdiction shall proceed without interference from a court of the other jurisdiction is a rule of right and of law based upon necessity, and where the necessity, actual or potential, does not exist the rule does not apply. Since that necessity does exist in actions in rem and does not exist in actions in personam, involving a question of personal liability only, the rule applies in the former but does not apply in the latter.'\n The Act of 1793 expresses the desire of Congress to avoid friction between the federal government and the states resulting from the intrusion of federal authority into the orderly functioning of a state's judicial process. The reciprocal doctrine of the res cases is but an application of the reason underlying the Act. Contest between the representatives of two distinct judicial systems over the same physical property would give rise to actual physical friction. The rule has become well settled, therefore, that Section 265 does not preclude the use of the injunction by a federal court to restrain state proceedings seeking to interfere with property in the custody of the court. \n6\n Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R. Co., 177 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 136]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 51, 61, 20 S.Ct. 564, 568; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 229\n, 235 S., 43 S.Ct. 79, 81, 83, 24 A.L.R. 1077; Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 88\n, 89 S., 43 S.Ct. 480, 484; see Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345, 359-66. And where a state court first acquires control of the res, the federal courts are disabled from exercising any power over it, by injunction or otherwise. Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118\n, 29 S.Ct. 230.\n Another group of cases is said to constitute an exception to  265, namely, where federal courts have enjoined litigants from enforcing judgments fraudulently obtained in the state courts. Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 \nU.S. 589\n, 12 S.Ct. 62; Simon v. Southern Railway Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115\n, 35 S.Ct. 255; Essanay Film Co. v. Kane, \n258 \nU.S. 358\n, 42 S.Ct. 318; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S.Ct. 469; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175\n, 41 S.Ct. 93. In the Simon case, Mr. Justice Lamar undertook to rationalize this class of cases by regarding a state court 'proceeding' as completed once judgment is secured, with the result that an injunction against levying execution does not stay a judicial 'proceeding'. 236 U.S. at page 124, 35 S.Ct. at page 258. But this construction of  265 was rejected in Hill v. Martin, \n296 \nU.S. 393, 403\n, 56 S.Ct. 278, 282: 'That term (proceedings) is comprehensive. It includes all steps taken or which may be taken in the state court or by its officers from the institution to the close of the final process. It applies to appellate as well as to original proceedings; and is independent of the doctrine of res judicata. It applies alike to action by the court and by its ministerial officers; applies not only to an execution issued on a judgment, but to any proceeding supplemental or ancillary taken with a view to making the suit or judgment effective.' However, the opinion cites the Wells Fargo and Essanay Film cases in a footnote dealing with 'the recognized exceptions to section 265.' \n296 \nU.S. 403\n, 56 S.Ct. 283, note 19. The foundation of these cases is thus very doubtful. However, we need not under- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 137]\n\u00a0\n take to re-examine them here since, in any event, they do not govern the cases at bar. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. We come, then, to the so-called 'relitigation' cases, the first of which is Dial v. Reynolds, \n96 \nU.S. 340\n. The facts of the case are simple: Cooper was indebted to Staatsman. To secure these debts he executed a mortgage deed of trust under which Dial was trustee. Asserting title in himself to the property covered by the mortgage, Reynolds brought ejectment against Cooper in the federal court. On writ of error this Court set aside a judgment in Reynolds' favor and held title to be in Cooper. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 321. Reynolds thereafter dismissed his ejectment action in the federal court and brought a new action against Cooper in a Tennessee state court based upon the claim thus previously litigated. Dial and Staatsman, joining Cooper as a party defendant, filed suit in the federal court to foreclose the mortgage and to enjoin Reynolds from further prosecuting his action in the state court. The lower court sustained Reynolds' demurrer, and this Court affirmed. It held that the 'gravamen' of the bills was an injunction to prevent Reynolds from proceeding in the state court. 'Such an injunction, except under the Bankrupt Act, no court of the United States can grant. With this exception, it is expressly forbidden by law.' 96 U.S. at page 341.8 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 138]\n\u00a0\n Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 214\n, 38 S.Ct. 460, was not a 'relitigation' case. The Texas federal district court, in a suit brought by various carriers, granted a preliminary injunction restraining the state Attorney General from proceeding to assess fines and penalties upon them for complying with an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Attorney General nevertheless instituted proceedings in a state court to enjoin the carriers from complying with the Commission's order, and a supplemental bill was filed in the federal court to stay the proceedings. The district court issued the injunction, and this Court dismissed an appeal under  266, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, holding that the injunction below was not based upon the unconstitutionality of the Texas state statutes, but was granted merely to protect its jurisdiction until the suit brought by the carriers was finally settled. The case obviously does not rule ours. Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, \n255 \nU.S. 356\n, 41 S. Ct. 338, held that a federal district court, having rendered a decree in a class suit brought in behalf of all the members of a certain class of beneficiaries in a fraternal association, may enjoin members of the class, found to be bound by the decree, from prosecuting suits in the state courts which would relitigate questions settled by such decree. The opinion of Mr. Justice Day contains no reference to either the Act of March 2, 1793, or to Dial v. Reynolds. The opinion is devoted almost entirely to a discussion of whether the former decree is res judicata in the state suits. Having determined this question in the affirmative, the Court disposed of the remaining-s 265-question in one sentence, citing only one case in support of its conclusion, Looney v. Eastern \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 139]\n\u00a0\n Texas R. Co., supra, which, as we have seen, was not a relitigation case. \n9\n 255 U.S. at page 367, 41 S.Ct. at page 342.\n Fifth. We find, therefore, that apart from Congressional authorization, only one 'exception' has been imbedded in  265 by judicial construction, to wit, the res cases. The fact that one exception has found its way into  265 is no justification for making another. Furthermore, the res exception, having its roots in the same policy from which sprang  265, has had an uninterrupted and firmly established acceptance in the decisions. The rule of the res cases was unequivocally on the books when Congress reenacted the original  5 of the Act of 1793, first by the Revised Statutes of 1874 and later by the Judicial Code in 1911.\n In striking contrast are the 'relitigation cases.' Loose language and a sporadic, ill-considered decision cannot be held to have imbedded in our law a doctrine which so patently violates the expressed prohibition of Congress. 10 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 140]\n\u00a0\n We are not dealing here with a settled course of decisions, erroneous in origin but around which substantial interests have clustered. Only a few recent and episodic utterances furnish a tenuous basis for the exception which we are now asked explicitly to sanction. Whatever justification there may be for turning past error into law when reasonable expectations would thereby be defeated, no such justification can be urged on behalf of a procedural doctrine in the distribution of judicial power between federal and state courts. It denies reality to suggest that litigants have shaped their conduct in reliance upon some loose talk in past decisions in the application of  265 or, more concretely, upon erroneous implications drawn from Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., supra, and Supreme Tribe of BenHur v. Cauble, supra. Compare Helvering v. Hallock, \n309 \nU.S. 106, 119\n, 120 S., 60 S.Ct. 444, 451, 125 A.L.R. 1368.\n It is indulging in the merest fiction to suggest that the doctrine which for the first time we are asked to pronounce with our eyes open and in the light of full consideration, was so obviously and firmly part of the texture of our law that Congress in effect enacted it through its silence. There is no occasion here to regard the silence of Congress as more commanding than its own plainly \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 141]\n\u00a0\n and unmistakably spoken words. This is not a situation where Congress has failed to act after having been requested to act or where the circumstances are such that Congress would ordinarily be expected to act. The provisions of  265 have never been the subject of comprehensive legislative reexamination. Even the exceptions referable to legislation have been incidental features of other statutory schemes, such as the Removal and Interpleader Acts. The explicit and comprehensive policy of the Act of 1793 has been left intact. To find significance in Congressional nonaction under these circumstances is to find significance where there is none.\n Section 265 is not an isolated instance of withholding from the federal courts equity powers possessed by Anglo-American courts. As part of the delicate adjustments required by our federalism, Congress has rigorously controlled the 'inferior courts' in their relation to the courts of the states. The unitary system of the courts of England is saved these problems.\n The guiding consideration in the enforcement of the Congressional policy was expressed by Mr. Justice Campbell, for the Court, in Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 597:\n'The legislation of Congress, in organizing the judicial powers of the United States, exhibits much circumspection in avoiding occasions for placing the tribunals of the States and of the Union in any collision.'\n\n We must be scrupulous in our regard for the limits within which Congress has confined the authority of the courts of its own creation.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of No. 19.\n\n Mr. Justice, REED, dissenting.\n The controlling issue in both the Toucey and the Phoenix Finance cases is the power of a federal court to pro- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 142]\n\u00a0\n tect those who have obtained its decrees against an effort to force relitigation of the same causes of action in the state courts. Questions of res judicata seem inapposite for the conclusion. We are not concerned in either case with the effect of the decrees if and when they might be pleaded in the state actions. Since federal jurisdiction in each case depended upon diversity, their effect as a pleaded bar to recovery in the state suits would depend upon the faith and credit by law or usage given like judgments of courts of the state containing the federal district. \n1\n But when the preliminary question is the meaning and application of the federal decree as a basis for a conclusion as to whether or not the decree shall be enforced by further steps, it is entirely a federal question. It is immaterial from that point of view whether the federal jurisdiction was bottomed originally on diversity, or the Constitution or laws of the United States. The power to give effect to the judgments of federal courts rests with Congress. \n2\n It has exercised that power for general purposes by Judicial Code  262, 28 U.S.C.A.  377.3\n As originally enacted  265 was a single line in a two page act concerning practice in the federal courts, Act of March 2, 1793, c. 22,  5, 1 Stat. 334. The act's disconnected provisions were amendments to the statute establishing Judicial Courts of the United States. The short section in which  265 appeared on the one hand enlarged \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 143]\n\u00a0\n equity powers of judges of this Court by authorizing them to issue writs of ne exeat and injunction, and on the other restricted the use of restraining orders without notice. Left to the four corners of the act, for lack of legislative materials, for deductions as to the purpose and intention of the enacting Congress, and faced with the absolute prohibition of its words, it might well be concluded that the intention was to bar an injunction running against the court itself as distinguished from the parties. \n4\n The fact that courts of equity had long exercised the power to entertain bills to carry their decrees into execution by injunction against the parties adds strength to such a supposition. \n5\n Such needed powers would not be lightly withdrawn.\n We are not relegated to such speculations, however. This provision in one form or another has been embodied in our statute law since 1793. It was continued by the adoption of the Revised Statutes of 1878 and the Judicial Code of 1911. It and the cases interpreting it have been woven into the fabric of our law through the decades. What changes would have been made in its form to meet the needs of our expanding jurisprudence, were it not for the flexibility supplied by judicial interpretation, we can only conjecture. Certainly when the code of 1911 restated its terms, the Congress took into consideration what had by that time come to be its accepted interpretation. Granted that  265 is not a sentence or section of a legislative scheme whose meaning is to be sought in the purpose of the entire enactment or series of enactments,6 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 144]\n\u00a0\n we are nevertheless led by the judicial history intervening since its passage to look beyond the literal language and give weight to those decisions which had added to its content before the reenactment in the Judicial Code. In the Senate Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification no change in language was suggested. Yet the Committee as indicative of the then state of the law cited numerous cases which are relitigation cases and are analyzed or referred to later in this opinion. \n7\n We are all the more persuaded to believe that the Code of 1911 intended to accept this early legislation with its judicial gloss because of the alternative offered. This alternative is that a federal judgment entered perhaps after years of expense in money and energy and after the production of thousands of pages of evidence comes to nothing that is final. It is to be only the basis for a plea of res judicata which is to be examined by another court, unfamiliar with the record already made, to determine whether the issues were or were not settled by the former adjudication. \n8\n We, too, desire that the difficulties innate in the federal system of government may be smoothed away without a clash of sovereignties but we find no cause for alarm in affirming a court which forbids parties bound by its decree to fight the battle over on another day and field. \n9\n We should not in reaching for theoretical symmetry hamper the efficiency and needlessly break the continuity of our judicial methodology. A decree forbidding a defeated party from setting up any right, anywhere, based upon \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 145]\n\u00a0\n claims adjudged is the usual form where injunctions are appropriate for determining controversies. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The courts properly are hesitant to depart from literalism in interpreting a statute. \n11\n Strong equities do induce departure from the ordinary course where the purpose of the Congress appears plain. \n12\n It is hard to conceive of a statute, new or old, which has a meaning totally disassociated from supporting legislation or the body of adjudications within its ambit. This statute is in a posture much more favorable for the interpretation that it authorizes injunctions against relitigation in state courts than were the statutes construed in any of the cases cited in the preceding note for the interpretation given them. In fact we conclude that its restatement in the Code of 1911 with the decisions now to be examined in existence necessitates the interpretation here advocated. Additional decisions since 1911 and the failure of Congress to repudiate this interpretation add something of substance to this argument.\n There exists no divergence of view in regard to the power of federal courts to enjoin proceedings in state courts where the state action may embarrass or interfere with the federal court's prior control over a res which is in its possession. \n13\n That is an exception to  265. Equally firmly embedded is the power long exercised as compatible with  265, of carrying into execution by injunction against state actions the equitable decrees which have settled rights or claims between the parties to the federal litigation. This might be said to be auxiliary to the protective jurisdiction over property in the possession \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 146]\n\u00a0\n of a court. Inasmuch, however, as the cases hereafter cited concern rights arising from claims already adjudicated, and since, in the cases where a res was at one time involved, the property was no longer in the possession of the court issuing the injunction, the theory of preventing an unseemly clash over physical possession has no basis. The principle for which the following authorities stand is that a court has the right to execute its decrees to avoid relitigation and forced reliance on res judicata. The proceedings, as will be made to appear later, which were supplemented by the orders prohibiting state suits here under review, fall well within the limits of this hitherto well recognized conception.\n As early as 1893 this Court declared in Root v. Woolworth, \n150 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 14 S.Ct. 136, 139, that the 'jurisdiction of courts of equity to interfere and effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance, in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties, is well settled.' Root, the party enjoined by the original decree, asserted rights which would require relitigation of settled issues. Accordingly he was enjoined on supplemental bill, inter alia, 'from bringing any action or actions touching the title to or possession of the said premises ....' Until dissolved, that injunction forbade proceedings in state and federal courts alike. Although  265 was not discussed, the case is cited as a convenient summary of the then law, and because it promptly became a precedent for enforcement of decrees even when the problem of  265 was raised. The authority of this case has not been doubted until now.\n Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537, 544\n, 23 S.Ct. 398, 401, forbade a state suit in violation of a federal court stipulation for a decree, treated the stipulation as a decree, and enjoined an action in personam in the state court for the collection of penalties under an unconstitutional statute. The state action was in violation of the original federal decree. This Court said: 'The jurisdiction of the circuit court could not be \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 147]\n\u00a0\n defeated or impaired by the institution, by one of the parties, of subsequent proceedings, whether civil or criminal, involving the same legal questions, in the state court.'\n In \n193 \nU.S. 93\n, 24 S.Ct. 399, appeared the case of Julian v. Central Trust Company. A railroad property in North Carolina had been sold under foreclosure proceedings in the federal circuit court. The decree was that the property be sold free of all claims of parties and the judicial sale was confirmed to the Southern Railway Company. Some years later a cause of action arose which was prosecuted to judgment in a state court against the original mortgagor without notice to or claim against the purchaser, the Southern. In the face of a threat to sell the property formerly conveyed by the federal decree, the circuit court enjoined the state proceedings. This Court said, 193 U.S. at pages 112, 114, 24 S.Ct. at pages 407, 408: 'In such case we are of opinion that a supplemental bill may be filed in the original suit with a view to protecting the prior jurisdiction of the Federal court and to render effectual its decree. ... In such cases, where the Federal court acts in aid of its own jurisdiction and to render its decree effectual, it may, notwithstanding  720, Rev.Stat. ( 265, J.C.), restrain all proceedings in a state court which would have the effect of defeating or impairing its jurisdiction. ... It is conceded that the Federal right could be set up in the state court from which the execution issued, and, if denied, the ultimate rights of the parties can be determined upon writ of error to this court. In the view we have taken of this case the Federal court had not lost its jurisdiction to protect the purchaser at its sale upon direct proceedings such as are now before us.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 148]\n\u00a0\n Riverdale Cotton Mills v. Alabama & G. Manufacturing Co., \n198 \nU.S. 189\n, 25 S.Ct. 629, followed the established doctrine. The Riverdale Mills acquired property by judicial sale in the federal court. A state proceeding later was begun by parties to the federal foreclosure alleging the invalidity of the sale and seeking possession of the property. Riverdale then filed an ancillary bill in the original foreclosure suit for an injunction against prosecution of the state suit. Against the claimed protection of R.S.  720 ( 265, J.C.), p. 193, it was held here that a federal court may 'protect the title which it has decreed as against every one a party to the original suit, and prevent that party from relitigating the questions of right which have already been determined.' 198 U.S. at page 195, 25 S.Ct. at page 632.\n It is quite clear that the Court in both the Julian and the Riverdale cases was intent not on protecting a res, since that had long passed from its hands, but on avoiding relitigation by executing its decrees. This appears particularly from their reliance upon French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 note, Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, \n103 \nU.S. 494\n, and Sharon v. Terry, C.C., 36 F. 337, 1 L.R.A. 572. In the French case no res was involved. It was a federal injunction against the enforcement of a judgment of a state court obtained in a state action after removal of a related but separate state suit. The reasoning proceeded upon the protection of federal judgments, not on the language of the removal statute. The same is true of Dietzsch. There a state suit on a replevin bond was enjoined by the federal court because it grew out of a failure to return property awarded in replevin in a state court after the removal of the original replevin suit to the federal court which issued the injunction. It was there said, 103 U.S. at page 497: 'A court of the United States is not prevented from enforcing its own judgments by the statute which forbids it to grant a writ of injunction to stay proceedings in a State court.' \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 149]\n\u00a0\n The Court today lays aside Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 1906, \n200 \nU.S. 273\n, 26 S.Ct. 252, as inapplicable. The case in our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision. It forcefully declares, albeit by alternative ruling, for the position here taken. A federal court had enjoined a state tax on the ground of unconstitutionality. The state was a party. Years later the state brought an action in the state court for the tax which the decree prohibited. An ancillary bill sought and obtained an injunction from the federal court. This Court said, 200 U.S. at page 292, 26 S.Ct. at page 259: 'Indeed, the proposition that the 11th Amendment, or  720 of the Revised Statutes, control a court of the United States in administering relief, although the court was acting in a matter ancillary to a decree rendered in a cause over which it had jurisdiction, is not open for discussion. Dietzsch v. Huidekoper (Kern v. Huidekoper) \n103 \nU.S. 494\n; Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537\n, 23 S.Ct. 398; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 24 S.Ct. 399 (407), 639.' It cannot fairly be said, we think, that this was not a holding that a federal court has the duty to protect its parties against relitigation. This seems quite certain when we examine the cases cited which are discussed heretofore in this opinion.\n The Terry case cited under the Riverdale Mills case, supra, is a good illustration of the permeation of our law by the principle of protection of federal decrees by injunctions against prosecuting state suits which relitigate settled issues. In Sharon v. Terry, a former decree had determined the fraudulent character of a marriage contract, and had enjoined all efforts to establish rights under any of its provisions. Notwithstanding this decree a party thereafter sought and obtained a judgment of the highest court of the state determining the marriage contract valid. There was no plea of res judicata in the state proceedings. After the entry of the state judgment, the personal representative of the winning party in the federal suit revived that proceeding and obtained a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 150]\n\u00a0\n renewal of the injunction over the specific objection that R.S.  720 ( 265, J.C.) barred the order. C.C., 36 F. 337, 365, 1 L.R.A. 572.\n The opinion was by Justice Field of this Court on circuit and stated: 'The decree of the federal court, when revived, may be used to stay any attempted enforcement of the judgment of the state court.' 36 F. at p. 364. It is true that the opinion shows that the circuit court was of the view that prior jurisdiction of an in personam cause gave the federal court authority to issue an injunction against state proceedings. 36 F. at p. 366. But the decision was directly on the point of enforcement of a decree. When the case came to this Court it was affirmed without consideration of  265 on the ground that the propriety of the revivor was the only matter for decision, \n131 \nU.S. 40\n, 9 S.Ct. 705.\n In the later case of Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Jones, C.C. 1909, 170 F. 124, a federal court had decided that a state statute fixing railroad rates was unconstitutional and had entered decrees for the railroads accordingly. Thereafter a county attorney commenced a suit in the state court against the companies to restrain collection of any but the statutory rate. On supplemental bill by the railroads the federal court enjoined him from prosecuting that suit, and relitigating the rate controversy. Similarly, in St. Louis Min. & Mill. Co. v. Montana Mining Co ., C.C.1906, 148 F. 450, the unsuccessful party in the federal suit was enjoined from proceeding further in the state court to relitigate matters already decided. \n15\n The fact that the federal proceeding was ancillary to an action to try title seems to have had no part in the decision. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 151]\n\u00a0\n These cases were all handed down before the adoption of the Judicial Code in 1911. They are catalogued to show that the power of the federal courts to make their decrees effective was accepted as consonant with the general prohibition of  265. Pomeroy taught that this was the law in 1905. 17 The rule was applied after 1911 when occasion arose. By Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, \n255 \nU.S. 356, 367\n, 41 S.Ct. 338, 342, it was decided in 1921 almost without discussion that a federal court which had entered a decree as to rights in a fraternal benefit association in a class suit might enjoin by ancillary bill other members of the class from relitigating the issues in a state suit. Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 214\n, 38 S.Ct. 460, cited as a controlling precedent was suggested there by appellant, the Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur, upon the very point here under discussion. Id., \n255 \nU.S. 356\n, 41 S.Ct. 339. This Court now lays the Looney case aside as not being a 'relitigation' case. While the injunction in the Looney case was not in aid of a decree, it was in aid of jurisdiction taken to determine a Texas rate controversy. A temporary injunction had been entered to maintain the status quo until a review by the Interstate Commerce Commission. A temporary injunction may well be likened to a decree and entitled to the same protection against relitigation. Such was evidently this Court's view. It said, 247 U.S. at page 221, 38 S.Ct. at page 462: 'So important is it that unseemly conflict of authority between state and federal courts should be avoided by maintaining the jurisdiction of each free from the encroachments of the other, that section 265 of the Judicial Code, Revised Statutes, section 720, Act of March 2, 1793, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 152]\n\u00a0\n c. 22, 1 Stat.L. 334, has repeatedly been held not applicable to such an injunction.'\n The last case in this Court, Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 697, 93 A.L.R. 195, upheld by a unanimous court an injunction upon an ancillary bill in a bankruptcy proceeding forbidding the prosecution in a state court of a claim discharged in bankruptcy. This Court placed its decision squarely on the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to execute its decrees 'notwithstanding the provisions of section 265 of the Judicial Code.' Quite properly no mention is made of the exception in  265 'except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.' The only authorization for injunctions is in Bankruptcy Act  11, 11 U.S.C.  29, 11 U.S.C.A.  29, which provides for a stay of pending suits during adjudication in bankruptcy. This is substantially the language of  21 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 526, which caused the insertion of the exception in the Revised Statutes as is shown by the cross-reference under R.S.  720. The specific exception of  265 was inapplicable to the Local Loan Company situation. Furthermore, this case involved a res only in the sense that every bankruptcy proceeding involves a res, i.e., the estate.\n Other federal courts since the adoption of the Judicial Code have continued to enjoin relitigation of settled issues. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n We think it may be accurately stated that for more than half a century there has been a widely accepted rule sup- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 153]\n\u00a0\n porting the power of federal courts to prevent relitigation. There are adequate precedents directly in point and others which recognize that the rule exists and is sound. Some at one time involved a res. A number applied the same rule when a res was never in the hands of the court. Not a case nor a text book is cited to support the Court's present position. No articles in periodicals suggest the propriety or desirability of so positive a change, except a single query as to the logic of the relitigation development. \n19\n Though the Judicial Code received careful analysis before adoption,20 no language was inserted to disavow the settled construction of the reenacted section. Dial v. Reynolds, \n96 \nU.S. 340\n, said by the Court to be a 'relitigation' case, did not involve a decree. In a federal suit to quiet title an injunction was sought to forbid a state action in ejectment. It is in line with Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077, but not even persuasive on the question of relitigation or execution of decrees.\n We turn now briefly to the original and auxiliary decrees in the two cases under consideration. In the Toucey case his suit in equity against the insurance company for restoration of an insurance policy and payments for benefits under it on the ground of the fraud of the company was decided against Toucey. An assignee of Toucey's in privity with him sought to relitigate the same issues in a state court. The federal court which entered the original decree enjoined on supplemental bill 'retrial, reconsideration or readjudication' of the settled issues and the prosecution of the state action. 21 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 118, 154]\n\u00a0\n In the Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Co. case a decree invalidating a certain mortgage and bonds issued in consideration of claimed indebtedness after protracted litigation was entered December 1, 1936, in a mortgage foreclosure suit brought in federal court by the bondholders. This decree became final. \n22\n Thereafter parties to the proceedings sought to litigate, in the state courts of Delaware, the validity of certain items of the indebtedness which are alleged to form the basis for the bond issue and to have been invalidated by the former federal decree. A supplemental and ancillary bill was filed by the Bridge Company in the original federal court suit seeking an injunction against the relitigation of the already adjudicated causes of action. The District Court granted the injunction on a finding that the causes declared upon in Delaware had been settled by the federal litigation. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n These summary statements show plainly, it seems to us, that the injunctions now set aside by this Court were issued within the recognized rule that federal courts may protect their decree by prohibiting relitigation without violation of  265 as heretofore understood and interpreted. Both decrees should be affirmed. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pleading a federal decree as res judicata in a state suit raises a federal question reviewable in this Court under  237(b) of the Judicial Code, 43 Stat. 937, 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).\n Dupasseur v.

Smith v. Apple, \n264 \nU.S. 274, 279\n, 44 S. Ct. 311, 313. See Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., \n308 \nU.S. 66, 74\n, 60 S.Ct. 44, 48. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The last clause of  5 of the Act of 1793, outlawing the familiar ex parte injunction, affords another illustration of hostility to chancery practice: 'nor shall such writ (of injunction) be granted in any case without reasonable previous notice to the adverse party, or his attorney, of the time and place of moving for the same.' 1 Stat. 335. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 262 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1162, 28 U.S.C.  377, 28 U.S.C.A.  377, is derived from Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 81, which provided that the 'courts of the United States, shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.' The general powers thus given to the federal courts were obviously limited by the subsequent enactment of the specific prohibitory provisions of the Act of 1793. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The first case arising under the provision was Diggs & Keith v. Wolcott, 1807, 4 Cranch 179, where the appellants brought an action at law on various promissory notes in a state court. While this action was still pending, the defendant filed a bill in the state chancery court for cancellation of the notes. The latter suit was removed to the federal circuit court which cancelled the notes and enjoined the further prosecution of the state action at law. The report of the proceeding in this Court states merely that 'the court being of opinion that a circuit court of the United States had not jurisdiction to enjoin proceedings in a state court, reversed the decree.' In his Commentaries on American Law ( 1826) vol. 1, p. 386, Chancellor Kent, stating that the decision in the case 'is not to be contested', refers to it as illustrative of a situation 'in which any control by the federal over the state courts, other than by means of the established appellate jurisdiction, has equally been prevented.' Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625, holding that a federal court sitting in bankruptcy could not discharge the lien of a prior attachment made under state law, was the first case which expressly relied upon the Act of 1793. In Orton v. Smith, 18 How. 263, 266, the Court held it error to enjoin a state action to establish title to certain land. 'The courts of the United States have no such power over suitors in a state court.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The extent to which a federal court's exclusive control over the res may require use of the injunction to effectuate its decrees in rem is illustrated by Riverdale Cotton Mills v. Alabama & G. Manufacturing Co., \n198 \nU.S. 188\n, 25 S.Ct. 629; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93\n, 24 S.Ct. 399; and Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 241\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 697, 93 A.L.R. 195. Cf. Ex parte Baldwin, \n291 \nU.S. 610, 615\n, 54 S.Ct. 551, 553. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] For similar reasons we need not here consider cases like Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764, and Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 273\n, 26 S. Ct. 252, with which compare Hale v. Bimco Trading, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 375, 378\n, 59 S.Ct. 526, 527. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Court also held that in a foreclosure proceeding the complainant cannot join a third person who claims adversely to the mortgagor and mortgagee, and that consequently there was a misjoinder of parties. 96 U.S. at page 341. These grounds for decision were, of course, alternative, and either alone was sufficient to dispose of the case. However, they were entirely separate and distinct, and there is no basis for any inference that the Court might have upheld an injunction if Reynolds had been properly joined. Nor need we consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Root v. Woolworth, \n150 \nU.S. 401\n, 14 S.Ct. 136, is erroneously regarded as illustrating a 'relitigation' exception to  265. The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to 'effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance, in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties'. 150 U.S. at pages 411, 412, 14 S.Ct. at pages 138, 139. The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree-no such state suit had been brought. Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of  265. The 'first come, first served' rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537\n, 23 S.Ct. 398, was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 235\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 83, 24 A.L.R. 1077. Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, \n91 \nU.S. 254\n, 257. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the 'relitigation' exception as settled doctrine, and that by  265 gave it legislative confirmation. The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court. Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470. Yet no reference was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the 'relitigation' doctrine: Root v. Woolworth, \n150 \nU.S. 401\n, 14 S.Ct. 136; Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537\n, 23 S.Ct. 398; Riverdale Cotton Mills v. Alabama & G. Manufacturing Co., \n198 \nU.S. 188\n, 25 S.Ct. 629; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n200 \nU.S. 273\n, 26 S.Ct. 252. (As we have already seen 'removal' cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, note, and Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, \n103 \nU.S. 494\n, rest upon an entirely different footing.) None of the reports submitted to Congress contained any discussion of  5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it.

S. v. CHICAGO, M., ST. P. & P. R. CO.(1941)\nNo. 535\nArgued: Decided: March 31, 1941\n\n\n\n As Amended April 28, 1941. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 593]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Norman M. Littell, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. A. C. Erdall, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the United States must compensate a riparian owner for injury to structures located between high and low water marks, where the damage is caused by the raising of the water level in a navigable stream for the improvement of navigation. The importance of the question, and a conflict in the decisions of this court, led to the grant of certiorari. \n311 \nU.S. 642\n, 61 S.Ct. 318, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The tracks of the respondent railroad and the pole lines of the respondent telegraph company in Wabasha and Winona counties, Minnesota, as relocated in 1910, are, in part, on an embankment on the westerly side of the Mississippi River. The embankment was adequately riprapped, where necessary, to protect it in times of high water.\n In the prosecution of a project for the improvement of navigation the United States has been, and is, engaged in constructing a series of locks and dams in the upper reaches of the Mississippi. One of the dams authorized by Act of Congress1 raises the level of the river and creates a pool which inundates bottom lands along the west bank.\n In 1933 the Government instituted condemnation proceedings to acquire the right to back water across the respondents' right of way and against their embankment. Since the dam raises the water level from 5.6 to 7.5 feet \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 594]\n\u00a0\n above ordinary high water mark, the respondents were compelled at certain points to add additional riprap to prevent damage to their embankment.\n At the trial in the condemnation proceeding the Government offered to prove that four segments of the embankment lie between the ordinary high and ordinary low water marks of the river; are, therefore, subject to the federal power to improve navigation; and that any injury to them by additional flooding is an incident of the exercise of the power and not the subject of compensation. The respondents objected to the offer as immaterial for the reason that neither before nor after the improvement did the embankment constitute an obstruction or menace to navigation and its maintenance was and is, therefore, a right of private property, the injury to which, in the prosecution of the federal project, entitled the owner to compensation.\n The District Court rejected the offer of proof. Thereupon the Government moved to dismiss from the proceedings all question of compensation for the four encroachment areas where the embankment was claimed to be located between high and low water marks. The motion was denied. A verdict and judgment ensued for damages to the entire length of the embankment both where it was admitted to be located on fast land and where it was claimed to lie between high and low water marks. Each party appealed. Thereafter, by stipulation, all questions, except that touching the four segments of the embankment which the Government claimed were located between high and low water marks, were eliminated from the cause. It was stipulated by the respondents that one of the four segments in question was so located, but as to the other three the parties are in disagreement. The Court of Appeals, for the purpose of decision, assumed that all four were so located but held, nevertheless, that the Government was bound \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 595]\n\u00a0\n to compensate the respondents for damage to all of them, and affirmed the judgment of the District Court. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Certain matters are not in dispute. The Mississippi River at the points in question is navigable. The respondent railroad is the riparian owner and, as such, its title extends to ordinary low water mark. The natural channel and the course of navigation through the pool formed by the dam lie at a considerable distance from the embankment which does not, and will not, obstruct or interfere with actual navigation. The lands lying between the embankment and the natural channel were low lands which, prior to the improvement, were to a great extent covered with trees and scrub.\n The respondents assert that the power of the Government to take private lands for the improvement of navigation is confined to the natural widths, levels, and flows of the river and that if more is taken compensation must be made. Their position is that the embankment can be injured without compensation only if it constitutes an encroachment and thus a hindrance or obstruction to actual navigation. The Government, on the other hand, insists that its power is not confined to the mere making or clearing of channels and removing hindrances and obstructions to their navigation, but embraces the exercise of every appropriate means for the improvement of navigable capacity and that, in the provision of any such means, it is entitled to deal with and alter the level of the stream to any extent up to ordinary high water mark without being answerable to riparian owners for injury to structures lying below that line.\n Commerce, the regulation of which between the states is committed by the Constitution to Congress, article 1,  8, cl. 3, includes navigation. 'The power to regulate commerce compre- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 596]\n\u00a0\n hends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States which are accessible from a State other than those in which they lie. For this purpose they are the public property of the nation, and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress.' \n3\n And the determination of the necessity for a given improvement of navigable capacity, and the character and extent of it, is for Congress alone. \n4\n Whether, under local law, the title to the bed of the stream is retained by the State or the title of the riparian owner extends to the thread of the stream, or, as in this case, to low water mark,5 the rights of the title holder are subordinate to the dominant power of the federal Government in respect of navigation. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The power of Congress extends not only to keeping clear the channels of interstate navigation by the prohibition or removal of actual obstructions located by the riparian owner, or others, but comprehends as well the power to improve and enlarge their navigability. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The bed of a river is 'that portion of its soil which is alternately covered and left bare, as there may be an increase or diminution in the supply of water, and which is adequate to contain it at its average and mean stage during the entire year, without reference to the extraordinary freshets of the winter or spring, or the extreme droughts of the summer or autumn.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The dominant power of the federal Government, as has \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 597]\n\u00a0\n been repeatedly held, extends to the entire bed of a stream, which includes the lands below ordinary high water mark. The exercise of the power within these limits is not an invasion of any private property right in such lands for which the United States must make compensation. \n9\n The damage sustained results not from a taking of the riparian owner's property in the stream bed, but from the lawful exercise of a power to which that property has always been subject.\n The respondents admit that this is the settled rule but insist that it has been applied only in cases where the control of the Government was exercised to extend the area of practicable navigation either by constructing channels for actual use or by removing obstructions to navigation. They assert, and the court below was of opinion, that United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445\n, 23 S.Ct. 349, and United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316\n, 37 S.Ct. 380, sanction a different principle where the improvement consists in the raising of the level of a stream to the injury of structures erected by the riparian owner between high and low water mark.\n What was said in the Cress case must be confined to the facts there disclosed. In that case, the Government's improvement in a navigable stream resulted in the flooding of the plaintiffs' land in and adjacent to a non-navigable stream. The owners of the land along and under the bed of the stream were held entitled to compensation for the damage to their lands. The question here presented was not discussed in the opinion.\n In the Lynah case the plaintiff's rice plantation was rendered worthless by the Government's raising the water in the Savannah River. Three questions were considered \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 598]\n\u00a0\n at length by this Court: Whether the trial court (the then Circuit Court) had jurisdiction; whether there was a taking of plaintiff's property; and whether the government was bound to compensate therefor. All were answered in the affirmative. Applying earlier decisions it was held that the permanent flooding of land adjacent to a stream in the improvement of navigation, pursuant to statutory authority, amounted to a taking and that the court had jurisdiction to award compensation upon the footing of an implied contract of the Government to pay for what it took. But as the court below points out, the quoted findings show, and the opinion adverted to the fact, that the plantation lay, in part, between the high and low water lines, and this Court held that the flooding constituted a taking of the whole for which compensation was due under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Moreover, three justices based their dissent largely on the fact that compensation was awarded for injury to lands lying below high water mark. We are bound, therefore, to determine whether we shall follow that decision in respect of the issue involved in the instant case. The decision was by a divided court and later, in a similar case, there was an affirmance by an equally divided court. \n10\n The case has often been cited as authority for the settled doctrine that an authorized taking of property for public use gives rise to an implied promise to pay just compensation. But we think this Court has never followed it as a binding decision that compensation is due for injury or destruction of a riparian owner's property located in the bed of a navigable stream. And we think that, so far as it sanctions such a principle, it is in irreconcilable conflict with our later decisions11 and cannot be considered as expressing the law. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 592, 599]\n\u00a0\n It is not true, as respondents maintain, that only structures in the bed of a navigable stream which obstruct or adversely affect navigation may be injured or destroyed without compensation by a federal improvement of navigable capacity. On the contrary, any structure is placed in the bed of a stream at the risk that it may be so injured or destroyed; and the right to compensation does not depend on the absence of physical interference with navigation. The ratio decidendi and the circumstances disclosed in numerous cases lead inevitably to this conclusion. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The respondents claim that two of the sections of embankment in question not only are above ordinary high water mark but also claim that they abut, not on the Mississippi River, but on a non-navigable tributary and that another, though along the bank of the river, is at or above the ordinary high water line. The Government disagrees. These issues of fact remain for solution by the District Court.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] River and Harbor Act of July 3, 1930, c. 847, 46 Stat. 918, 927. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 Cir., 113 F.2d 919. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Gilman v.

CLASSIC(1941)\nNo. 618\nArgued: April 7, 1941Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Oct. 13, 1941\n\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Herbert Wechsler, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Warren O. Coleman, of New Orleans, La., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 307]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Two counts of an indictment found in a federal district court charged that appellees, Commissioners of Elections, conducting a primary election under Louisiana law, to nominate a candidate of the Democratic Party for representative in Congress, willfully altered and falsely counted and certified the ballots of voters cast in the primary election. The questions for decision are whether the right of qualified voters to vote in the Louisiana primary and to have their ballots counted is a right 'secured ... by the Constitution' within the meaning of  19 and 20 of the Criminal Code, and whether the acts of appellees charged in the indictment violate those sections.\n On September 25, 1940, appellees were indicted in the District Court for Eastern Louisiana for violations of  19 and 20 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  51, 52, 18 U.S.C.A.  51, 52. The first count of the indictment alleged that a primary election was held on September 10, 1940, for the purpose of nominating a candidate of the Democratic Party for \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 308]\n\u00a0\n the office of Representative in Congress for the Second Congressional District of Louisiana, to be chosen at an election to be held on November 10th; that in that district nomination as a candidate of the Democratic Party is and always has been equivalent to an election; that appellees were Commissioners of Election, selected in accordance with the Louisiana law to conduct the primary in the Second Precinct of the Tenth Ward of New Orleans, in which there were five hundred and thirty-seven citizens and qualified voters.\n The charge based on these allegations, was that the appellees conspired with each other and with others unknown, to injure and oppress citizens in the free exercise and enjoyment of rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and Laws of the United States, namely, ( 1) the right of qualified voters who cast their ballots in the primary election to have their ballots counted as cast for the candidate of their choice, and (2) the right of the candidates to run for the office of Congressman and to have the votes in favor of their nomination counted as cast. The overt acts alleged were that the appellees altered eighty-three ballots cast for one candidate and fourteen cast for another, marking and counting them as votes for a third candidate, and that they falsely certified the number of votes cast for the respective candidates to the chairman of the Second Congressional District Committee.\n The second count, repeating the allegations of fact already detailed, charged that the appellees, as Commissioners of Election willfully and under color of law subjected registered voters at the pr mary who were inhabitants of Louisiana to the deprivation of rights, privileges and immunities secured and protected by the Constitution and Laws of the United States, namely their right to cast their votes for the candidates of their choice and to have their votes counted as cast. It further charged \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 309]\n\u00a0\n that this deprivation was effected by the willful failure and refusal of defendants to count the votes as cast, by their alteration of the ballots, and by their false certification of the number of votes cast for the respective candidates in the manner already indicated.\n The District Court sustained a demurrer to counts 1 and 2 on the ground that  19 and 20 of the Criminal Code under which the indictment was drawn do not apply to the state of facts disclosed by the indictment and that, if applied to those facts,  19 and 20 are without constitutional sanction, citing United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 488\n, 489 S., 37 S.Ct. 407, 411, 412; Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232\n, 41 S.Ct. 469. The case comes here on direct appeal from the District Court under the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act, Judicial Code,  238, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, which authorize an appeal by the United States from a decision or judgment sustaining a demurrer to an indictment where the decision or judgment is 'based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded'.\n Upon such an appeal our review is confined to the questions of statutory construction and validity decided by the District Court. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325; United States v. Birdsall, \n233 \nU.S. 223, 230\n, 34 S.Ct. 512, 514; United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, 193 S., 60 S.Ct. 182, 185. Hence, we do not pass upon various arguments advanced by appellees as to the sufficiency and construction of the indictment.\n Section 19 of the Criminal Code condemns as a criminal offense any conspiracy to injure a citizen in the exercise 'of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States'. Section 20 makes it a penal offense for anyone who, 'acting under color of any law' 'willfully subjects, or causes to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 310]\n\u00a0\n protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States'. The Government argues that the right of a qualified voter in a Louisiana congressional primary election to have his vote counted as cast is a right secured by Article I,  2 and 4 of the Constitution, and that a conspiracy to deprive the citizen of that right is a violation of  19, and also that the willful action of appellees as state officials, in falsely counting the ballots at the primary election and in falsely certifying the count, deprived qualified voters of that right and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, all in violation of  20 of the Criminal Code.\n Article I,  2 of the Constitution, commands that 'The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature'. By  4 of the same article 'The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators'. Such right as is secured by the Constitution to qualified voters to choose members of the House of Representatives is thus to be exercised in conformity to the requirements of state law subject to the restrictions prescribed by  2 and to the authority conferred on Congress by  4, to regulate he times, places and manner of holding elections for representatives.\n We look then to the statutes of Louisiana here involved to ascertain the nature of the right which under the constitutional mandate they define and confer on the voter and the effect upon its exercise of the acts with which appellees are charged, all with the view to determining, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 311]\n\u00a0\n first, whether the right or privilege is one secured by the Constitution of the United States, second, whether the effect under the state statute of appellee's alleged acts is such that they operate to injure or oppress citizens in the exercise of that right within the meaning of  19 and to deprive inhabitants of the state of that right within the meaning of  20, and finally, whether  19 and 20 respectively are in other respects applicable to the alleged acts of appellees.\n Pursuant to the authority given by  2 of Article I of the Constitution, and subject to the legislative power of Congress under  4 of Article I, and other pertinent provisions of the Constitution, the states are given, and in fact exercise a wide discretion in the formulation of a system for the choice by the people of representatives in Congress. In common with many other states Louisiana has exercised that discretion by setting up machinery for the effective choice of party candidates for representative in Congress by primary elections and by its laws it eliminates or seriously restricts the candidacy at the general election of all those who are defeated at the primary. All political parties, which are defined as those that have cast at least 5 per cent of the total vote at specified preceding elections, are required to nominate their candidates for representative by direct primary elections. Louisiana Act No. 46, Regular Session, 1940,  1 and 3.\n The primary is conducted by the state at public expense. Act No. 46, supra,  35. The primary, as is the general election, is subject to numerous statutory regulations as to the time, place and manner of conducting the election, including provisions to insure that the ballots cast at the primary are correctly counted, and the results of the count correctly recorded and certified to the Secretary of State, whose duty it is to place the names of the successful candidates of each party on the official \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 312]\n\u00a0\n ballot. \n1\n The Secretary of State is prohibited from placing on the official ballot the name of any person as a candidate for any political party not nominated in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Act 46,  1.\n One whose name does not appear on the primary ballot, if otherwise eligible to become a candidate at the general election, may do so in either of two ways, by filing nomination papers with the requisite number of signatures or by having his name 'written in' on the ballot on the final election. Louisiana Act No. 224, Regular Session 1940,  50, 73. Section 87 of Act No. 46 provides 'No one who participates in the primary election of any political party shall have the right to participate in any primary election of any other political party, with a view of nominating opposing candidates, nor shall he be permitted to sign any nomination papers for ny opposing candidate or candidates; nor shall he be permitted to be himself a candidate in opposition to any one nominated at or through a primary election in which he took part'.\n Section 15 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Louisiana as amended by Act 80 of 1934, provides that 'no person whose name is not authorized to be printed on the official ballot, as the nominee of a political party or as \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 313]\n\u00a0\n an independent candidate, shall be considered a candidate,' unless he shall file in the appropriate office at least ten days before the general election a statement containing the correct name under which he is to be voted for and containing the further statement that he is willing and consents to be voted for for that office. The article also provides that 'no commissioners of election shall count a ballot as cast for any person whose name is not printed on the ballot or who does not become a candidate in the foregoing manner'. Applying these provisions the Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans has held in Serpas v. Trebucq, 1 So.2d 346, decided April 7, 1941, rehearing denied with opinion April 21, 1941, 1 So.2d 705, that an unsuccessful candidate at the primary may not offer himself as a candidate at a general election, and that votes for him may not lawfully be written into the ballot or counted at such an election.\n The right to vote for a representative in Congress at the general election is, as a matter of law, thus restricted to the successful party candidate at the primary, to those not candidates at the primary who file nomination papers, and those whose names may be lawfully written into the ballot by the electors. Even if, as appellees argue, contrary to the decision in Serpas v. Trebucq, supra, voters may lawfully write into their ballots, cast at the general election, the name of a candidate rejected at the primary and have their ballots counted, the practical operation of the primary law in otherwise excluding from the ballot on the general election the names of candidates rejected at the primary is such as to impose serious restrictions upon the choice of candidates by the voters save by voting at the primary election. In fact, as alleged in the indictment, the practical operation of the primary in Louisiana, is and has been since the primary election was established in 1900 to secure the election of the Democratic primary \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 314]\n\u00a0\n nominee for the Second Congressional District of Louisiana. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Interference with the right to vote in the Congressional primary in the Second Congressional District for the choice of Democratic candidate for Congress is thus as a matter of law and in fact an interference with the effective choice of the voters at the only stage of the election procedure when their choice is of significance, since it is at the only stage when such interference could have any practical effect on the ultimate result, the choice of the Congressman to represent the district. The primary in Louisiana is an integral part of the procedure for the popular choice of Congressman. The right of qualified voters to vote at the Congressional primary in Louisiana and to have their ballots counted is thus the right to participate in that choice.\n We come then to the question whether that right is one secured by the Constitution. Section 2 of Article I commands that Congressmen shall be chosen by the people of the several states by electors, the qualifications of which it prescribes. The right of the people to choose, whatever its appropriate constitutional limitations, where in other respects it is defined, and the mode of its exercise is prescribed by state action in conformity to the Cons itution, is a right established and guaranteed by the Constitution and hence is one secured by it to those citizens and inhabitants of the state entitled to exercise the right.

While, in a loose sense, the right to vote for representatives in Congress is sometimes spoken of as a right derived from the states, see, Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 170; United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214, 217\n, 218 S.; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 39 S., 13 S.Ct. 3, 11, 12; Breedlove v. Suttles, \n302 \nU.S. 277, 283\n, 58 S.Ct. 205, 207, this statement is true only in the sense that the states are authorized by the Constitution, to legislate on the subject as provided by  2 of Art. I, to the extent that Congress has not restricted state action by the exercise of its powers to regulate elections under  4 and its more general power under Article I,  8, clause 18 of the Constitution 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers'. See Ex parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371\n; Ex parte Yarbrough, supra, \n110 \nU.S. 663, 664\n, 4 S.Ct. 158; Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487\n, 22 S.Ct. 783; Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 \nU.S. 58, 64\n, 21 S.Ct. 17, 20.\n Obviously included within the right to choose, secured by the Constitution, is the right of qualified voters within a state to cast their ballots and have them counted at Congressional elections. This Court has consistently held that this is a right secured by the Constitution. Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; Wiley v. Sinkler, supra; Swafford v. Templeton, supra; United States v. Mosley, supra; see Ex parte Siebold, supra; In re Coy, \n127 \nU.S. 731\n, 8 S.Ct. 1263; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263\n, 12 S.Ct. 617. And since the constitutional command is without restriction or limitation, the right unlike those guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, is secured against the action of individuals as well as of states. Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; Logan v. United States, supra.\n But we are now concerned with the question whether the right to choose at a primary election, a candidate for election as representative, is embraced in the right to choose representatives secured by Article I,  2. We may \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 316]\n\u00a0\n assume that the framers of the Constitution in adopting that section, did not have specifically in mind the selection and elimination of candidates for Congress by the direct primary any more than they contemplated the application of the commerce clause to interstate telephone, telegraph and wireless communication which are concededly within it. But in determining whether a provision of the Constitution applies to a new subject matter, it is of little significance that it is one with which the framers were not familiar. For in setting up an enduring framework of government they undertook to carry out for the indefinite future and in all the vicissitudes of the changing affairs of men, those fundamental purposes which the instrument itself discloses. Hence we read its words, not as we read legislative codes which are subject to continuous revision with the changing course of events, but as the revelation of the great purposes which were intended to be achieved by the Constitution as a continuing instrument of government. Cf. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97\n; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 595\n, 16 S.Ct. 644, 646; Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 282 S., 17 S.Ct. 326, 328, 329. If we r member that 'it is a Constitution we are expounding', we cannot rightly prefer, of the possible meanings of its words, that which will defeat rather than effectuate the Constitutional purpose.\n That the free choice by the people of representatives in Congress, subject only to the restrictions to be found in  2 and 4 of Article I and elsewhere in the Constitution, was one of the great purposes of our Constitutional scheme of government cannot be doubted. We cannot regard it as any the less the constitutional purpose or its words as any the less guarantying the integrity of that choice when a state, exercising its privilege in the absence of Congressional action, changes the mode of choice from a single step, a general election, to two, of which the first is the choice at a primary of those candidates \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 317]\n\u00a0\n from whom, as a second step, the representative in Congress is to be chosen at the election.\n Nor can we say that that choice which the Constitution protects is restricted to the second step because  4 of Article I, as a means of securing a free choice of representatives by the people, has authorized Congress to regulate the manner of elections, without making any mention of primary elections. For we think that the authority of Congress, given by  4, includes the authority to regulate primary elections when, as in this case, they are a step in the exercise by the people of their choice of representatives in Congress. The point whether the power conferred by  4 includes in any circumstances the power to regulate primary elections was reserved in United States v. Gradwell, supra, \n243 \nU.S. 487\n, 37 S.Ct. 411. In Newberry v. United States, supra, four Justices of this Court were of opinion that the term 'elections' in  4 of Article I did not embrace a primary election since that procedure was unknown to the framers. A fifth Justice who with them pronounced the judgment of the Court, was of opinion that a primary, held under a law enacted before the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment, for the nomination of candidates for Senator, was not an election within the meaning of  4 of Article I of the Constitution, presumably because the choice of the primary imposed no legal restrictions on the election of Senators by the state legislatures to which their election had been committed by Article I,  3. The remaining four Justices were of the opinion that a primary election for the choice of candidates for Senator or Representative were elections subject to regulation by Congress within the meaning of  4 of Article I. The question then has not been prejudged by any decision of this Court.\n To decide it we turn to the words of the Constitution read in their historical setting as revealing the purpose of its framers, and in search for admissible meanings of its \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 318]\n\u00a0\n words which, in the circumstances of their application, will effectuate those purposes. As we have said, a dominant purpose of  2, so far as the selection of representatives in Congress is concerned, was to secure to the people the right to choose representatives by the designated electors, that is to say, by some form of election. Cf. the Seventeenth Amendment as to popular 'election' of Senators. From time immemorial an election to public office has been in point of substance no more and no less than the expression by qualified electors of their choice of candidates.\n Long before the adoption of the Constitution the form and mode of that expression had changed from time to time. There is no historical warrant for supposing that the framers were under the illusion that the method of effecting the choice of the electors would never change or that if it did, the change was for that reason to be permitted to defeat the right of the people to choose representatives for Congress which the Constitution had guaranteed. The right to participate in the choice of representatives for Congress includes, as we have said, the right to cast a ballot and to have it counted at the general el ction whether for the successful candidate or not. Where the state law has made the primary an integral part of the procedure of choice, or where in fact the primary effectively controls the choice, the right of the elector to have his ballot counted at the primary, is likewise included in the right protected by Article I,  2. And this right of participation is protected just as is the right to vote at the election, where the primary is by law made an integral part of the election machinery, whether the voter exercises his right in a party primary which invariably, sometimes or never determines the ultimate choice of the representative. Here, even apart from the circumstance that the Louisiana primary is made by law an \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 319]\n\u00a0\n integral part of the procedure of choice, the right to choose a representative is in fact controlled by the primary because, as is alleged in the indictment, the choice of candidates at the Democratic primary determines the choice of the elected representative. Moreover, we cannot close our eyes to the fact already mentioned that the practical influence of the choice of candidates at the primary may be so great as to affect profoundly the choice at the general election even though there is no effective legal prohibition upon the rejection at the election of the choice made at the primary and may thus operate to deprive the voter of his constitutional right of choice. This was noted and extensively commented upon by the concurring Justices in Newberry v. United States, supra, \n256 \nU.S. 263\n-269, 285, 287, 41 S.Ct. 476-478, 484.\n Unless the constitutional protection of the integrity of 'elections' extends to primary elections, Congress is left powerless to effect the constitutional purpose, and the popular choice of representatives is stripped of its constitutional protection save only as Congress, by taking over the control of state elections, may exclude from them the influence of the state primaries. 3 Such an expedient would end that state autonomy with respect to elections which the Constitution contemplated that Congress should be free to leave undisturbed, subject only to such minimum regulation as it should find necessary to insure the freedom \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 320]\n\u00a0\n and integrity of the choice. Words, especially those of a constitution, are not to be read with such stultifying narrowness. The words of  2 and 4 of Article I, read in the sense which is plainly permissible and in the light of the constitutional purpose, require us to hold that a primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress, and which in the circumstances of this case controls that choice, is an election within the meaning of the constitutional provision and is subject to congressional regulation as to the manner of holding it.\n Not only does  4 of Article I authorize Congress to regulate the manner of holding elections, but by Article I,  8, Clause 18, Congress is given authority 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.' This provision leaves to the Congress the choice of means by which its constitutional powers are to be carried into execution. 'L t the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional'. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. That principle has been consistently adhered to and liberally applied, and extends to the congressional power by appropriate legislation to safeguard the right of choice by the people of representatives in Congress secured by  2 of Article I.

Section 19 makes it a crime to conspire to 'injure' or 'oppress' any citizen 'in the free exercise ... of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution'.4 In Ex parte Yarbrough, supra, and in United States v. Mosley, supra, as we have seen, it was held that the right to vote in a congressional election is a right secured by the Constitution, and that a conspiracy to prevent the citizen from voting or to prevent the official count of his ballot when cast, is a conspiracy to injure and oppress the citizen in the free exercise of a right secured by the Constitution within the meaning of  19. In reaching this conclusion the Court found no uncertainty or ambiguity in the statutory language, obviously devised to protect the citizen 'in the free exercise ... of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution', and concerned itself with the question whether the right to participate in choosing a representa- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 322]\n\u00a0\n tive is so secured. \n5\n Such is our function here. Conspiracy to prevent the official count of a citizen's ballot, held in United States v. Mosley, supra, to be a violation of  19 in the case of a congressional election, is equally a conspiracy to injure and oppress the citizen when the ballots are cast in a primary election prerequisite to the choice of party candidates for a congressional election. In both cases the right infringed is one secured by the Constitution. The injury suffered by the citizen in the exercise of the right is an injury which the statute describes and to which it applies in the one case as in the other.\n The suggestion that  19, concededly applicable to conspiracies to deprive electors of their votes at congressional elections, is not sufficiently specific to be deemed applicable to primary elections, will hardly bear examination. Section 19 speaks neither of elections nor of primaries. In unambiguous language it protects 'any right or privilege secured ... by the Constitution', a phrase which as we have seen extends to the right of the voter to have his vote counted in both the general election and in the primary election, where the latter is a part of the election machinery, as well as to numerous other constitutional rights which are wholly unrelated to the choice of a representative in Congress. United States v. Waddell, \n112 \nU.S. 76\n, 5 S.Ct. 35; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263\n, 12 S.Ct. 617; In re Quarles, \n158 \nU.S. 532\n, 15 S.Ct. 959; Motes v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 458\n, 20 S.Ct. 993; Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, L.R.A.1916A, 1124.\n In the face of the broad language of the statute, we are pointed to no principle of statutory construction \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 323]\n\u00a0\n and to no significant legislative history which could be thought to sanction our saying that the statute applies any the less to primaries than to elections, where in one as in the other it is the same constitutional right which is infringed. It does not avail to attempt to distinguish the protection afforded by  1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 6 to the right to participate in primary as well as general elections, secured to all citizens by the Constitution, see Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, L.R.A.1916A, 1124; Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S.Ct. 446; Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73\n, 52 S.Ct. 484, 88 A.L.R. 458; Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268\n, 59 S.Ct. 872, on the ground that in those cases the injured citizens were Negroes whose rights were clearly protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At least since Ex parte Yarbrough, supra, and no member of the Court seems ever to have questioned it, the right to participate in the choice of representatives in Congress has been recognized as a right protected by Art. I,  2 and 4 of the Constitution. 7 Differences of opinion have arisen as to the effect of the primary in particular cases on the choice of representatives. But we are troubled by no such doubt here. Hence, the right to participate through the primary in the choice of representatives in Congress-a right clearly secured by the Constitution-is within the words and \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 324]\n\u00a0\n purpose of  19 in the same manner and to the same extent as the right to vote at the general election. United States v. Mosley, supra. It is no extension of the criminal statute, as it was not of the civil statute in Nixon v. Herndon, supra, to find a violation of it in a new method of interference with the right which its words protect. For it is the constitutional right, regardless of the method of interference, which is the subject of the statute and which in precise terms it protects from injury and oppression.\n It is hardly the performance of the judicial function to construe a statute, which in terms protects a right secured by the Constitution, here the right to choose a representative in Congress, as applying to an election whose only function is to ratify a choice already made at the primary but as having no application to the primary which is the only effective means of choice. To withdraw from the scope of the statute, an effective interference with the constitutional right of choice, because other wholly different situations not now before us may not be found to involve such an interference, cf. United States v. Bathgate, \n246 \nU.S. 220\n, 38 S.Ct. 269; United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476\n, 37 S. Ct. 407, is to say that acts plainly within the statute should be deemed to be without it because other hypothetical cases may later be found not to infringe the constitutional right with which alone the statute is concerned.\n If a right secured by the Constitution may be infringed by the corrupt failure to include the vote at a primary in the official count, it is not significant that the primary, like the voting machine, was unknown when  19 was adopted. 8 Abuse of either may infringe the right and \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 325]\n\u00a0\n therefore violate  19. See United States v. Pleva, 2 Cir., 66 F.2d 529, 530; cf. Browder v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 335\n, 61 S.Ct. 599, 85 L.Ed. --. Nor does the fact that in circumstances not here present there may be difficulty in determining whether the primary so affects the right of the choice as to bring it within the constitutional protection, afford any ground for doubting the construction and application of the statute once the constitutional question is resolved. That difficulty is inherent in the judicial administration of every federal criminal statute, for none, whatever its terms, can be applied beyond the reach of the congressional power which the Constitution confers. Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S.Ct. 9; Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308\n, 33 S.Ct. 281, 43 L.R.A.,N.S., 906, Ann.Cas.1913E, 905; Nash v.

Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken 'under color of' state law. Ex parte Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 339\n, 346; Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, \n227 \nU.S. 278\n, 287, et seq., 33 S.Ct. 312, 314; Hague v. C.I. O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 507\n, 519 S., 59 S.Ct. 954, 960, 965; cf. Id., 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 774, 790. Here the acts of appellees infringed the constitutional right and deprived the voters of the benefit of it within the meaning of  20, unless by its terms its application is restricted to deprivations 'on account of (an) inhabitant being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race'.\n The last clause of  20 protects inhabitants of a state from being subjected to different punishments, pains or penalties by reason of alienage, color or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens. That the qualification with respect to alienage, color and race, refers only to differences in punishment and not to deprivations of any rights or privileges secured by the Constitution, is evidenced by the structure of the section and the necessities of the practical application of its provisions. The qualification as to alienage, color and race, is a parenthetical phrase in the clause penalizing different punishments 'than are prescribed for ... citizens' and in the common use of language could refer only to the subject matter of the clause and not to that of the earlier one relating to the deprivation of rights to which it makes no reference in terms.\n Moreover the prohibited differences of punishment on account of alienage, color or race, are those referable to prescribed punishments which are to be compared with those prescribed for citizens. A standard is thus set up applicable to differences in prescribed punishments on account of alienage, color or race, which it would be diffi- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 327]\n\u00a0\n cult if not impossible to apply to the willful deprivations of constitutional rights or privileges, in order to determine whether they are on account of alienage, color or race. We think that  20 authorizes the punishment of two different offenses. The one is willfully subjecting any inhabitant to the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution; the other is willfully subjecting any inhabitant to different punishments on account of his color or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens. The meager legislative history of the section supports this conclusion. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 328]\n\u00a0\n So interpreted  20 applies to deprivation of the constitutional rights of qualified voters to choose representatives in Congress. The generality of the section made applicable as it is to deprivations of any constitutional right, does not obscure its meaning or impair its force within \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 329]\n\u00a0\n the scope of its application, which is restricted by its terms to deprivations which are willfully inflicted by those acting under color of any law, statute and the like.\n We do not discuss the application of  20 to deprivations of the right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, a point apparently raised and discussed for the first time in the Government's brief in this Court. The point was not specially considered or decided by the court below, and has not been assigned as error by the Government. Since the indictment on its face does not purport to charge a deprivation of equal protection to voters or candidates, we are not called upon to construe the indictment in order to raise a question of statutory validity or construction which we are alone authorized to review upon this appeal.\nREVERSED.\n The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n Free and honest elections are the very foundation of our republican form of government. Hence any attempt to defile the sanctity of the ballot cannot be viewed with equanimity. As stated by Mr. Justice Miller in Ex parte Yarbrough (The Ku-Klux Cases), \n110 \nU.S. 651, 666\n, 4 S.Ct. 152, 159, 'the temptations to control these elections by violence and by corruption' have been a constant source of danger in the history of all republics. The acts here charged, if proven, are of a kind which carries that threat and are highly offensive. Since they corrupt the process of Congressional elections, they transcend mere local concern and extend a contaminating influence into the national domain.\n I think Congress has ample power to deal with them. That is to say I disagree with Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232\n, 41 S.Ct. 469, to the extent that it holds that Congress \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 330]\n\u00a0\n has no power to control primary elections. Art. I,  2 of the Constitution provides that 'The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.' Art. I,  4 provides that 'The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.' And Art. I ,  8, clause 18 gives Congress the power 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.' Those sections are an arsenal of power ample to protect Congressional elections from any and all forms of pollution. The fact that a particular form of pollution has only an indirect effect on the final election is immaterial. The fact that it occurs in a primary election or nominating convention is likewise irrelevant. The important consideration is that the Constitution should be interpreted broadly so as to give to the representatives of a free people abundant power to deal with all the exigencies of the electoral process. It means that the Constitution should be read so as to give Congress an expansive implied power to place beyond the pale acts which, in their direct or indirect effect, impair the integrity of Congressional elections. For when corruption enters, the election is no longer free, the choice of the people is affected. To hold that Congress is powerless to control these primaries would indeed be a narrow construction of the Constitution inconsistent with the view that that instrument of government was designed not only for contemporary needs but for the vicissitudes of time.\n So I agree with most of the views expressed in the opinion of the Court. And it is with diffidence that I dissent from the result there reached. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 331]\n\u00a0\n The disagreement centers on the meaning of  19 of the Criminal Code which protects every right secured by the Constitution. The right to vote at a final Congressional election and the right to have one's vote counted in such an election have been held to be protected by  19. Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n, 35 S.Ct. 904. Yet I do not think that the principles of those cases should be, or properly can be, extended to primary elections. To sustain this indictment we must so extend them. But when we do, we enter perilous territory.\n We enter perilous territory because, as stated in United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 485\n, 37 S.Ct. 407, 410, there is no common law offense against the United States; 'the legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and declare the Court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence.' United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34. If a person is to be convicted of a crime, the offense must be clearly and plainly embraced within the statute. As stated by Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 105, 'probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.' It is one thing to allow wide and generous scope to the express and implied powers of Congress; it is distinctly another to read into the vague and general language of an act of Congress specifications of crimes. We should ever be mindful that 'before a man can be punished, his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the statute.' United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 10 S.Ct. 625, 626. That admonition is reemphasized here by the fact that  19 imposes not only a fine of $5,000 and ten years in prison but also makes him who is convicted 'ineligible to any office, or place of honor, profit, or trust created by the Constitution or laws of the United States.' It is not enough for us to find in the vague penumbra of a statute some offense about which Congress could have legislated and then to particularize it as a crime because it is highly \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 332]\n\u00a0\n offensive. Cf. James v. Bowman, \n190 \nU.S. 127\n, 23 S.Ct. 678. Civil liberties are too dear to permit conviction for crimes which are only implied and which can be spelled out only by adding inference to inference.\n Sec. 19 does not purport to be an exercise by Congress of its power to regulate primaries. It merely penalizes conspiracies 'to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States'. Thus, it does no more than refer us to the Constitution1 for the purpose of determining whether or not the right to vote in a primary is there secured. Hence we must do more than find in the Constitution the power of Congress to afford that protection. We must find that protection on the face of the Constitution itself. That is to say, we must in view of the wording of  19 read the relevant provisions of the Constitution for the purposes of this case through the window of a criminal statute.\n There can be put to one side cases where state election officials deprive negro citizens of their right to vote at a general election (Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, L.R.A.1916A, 1124), or at a primary. Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S.Ct. 446; Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73\n, 52 S.Ct. 484, 88 A.L. R. 458. Discrimination on the basis of race or color is plainly outlawed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the constitutional mandate is plain, there is no reason why  19 or  20 should not be applicable. But the situation here is quite different. When we turn to the constitutional provisions relevant to this case we find no such unambiguous mandate.\n Art. I,  4 specifies the machinery whereby the times, places and manner of holding elections shall be established and controlled. Art. I,  2 provides that representatives shall be 'chosen' by the people. But for purposes of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 333]\n\u00a0\n criminal law as contrasted to the interpretation of the Constitution as the source of the implied power of Congress, I do not hink that those provisions in absence of specific legislation by Congress protect the primary election or the nominating convention. While they protect the right to vote and the right to have one's vote counted at the final election as held in the Yarbrough and Mosley cases, they certainly do not per se extend to all acts which is their indirect or incidental effect restrain, restrict, or interfere with that choice. Bribery of voters at a general election certainly is an interference with that freedom of choice. It is a corruptive influence which for its impact on the election process is as intimate and direct as the acts charged in this indictment. And Congress has ample power to deal with it. But this Court in United States v. Bathgate, \n246 \nU.S. 220\n, 38 S.Ct. 269, by a unanimous vote, held that conspiracies to bribe voters at a general election were not covered by  19. While the conclusion in that case may be reconciled with the results in the Yarbrough and Mosley cases on the ground that the right to vote at a general election is personal while the bribery of voters only indirectly affects that personal right, that distinction is not of aid here. For the failure to count votes cast at a primary has by the same token only an indirect effect on the voting at the general election. In terms of causal effect tampering with the primary vote may be as important on the outcome of the general election as bribery of voters at the general election itself. Certainly from the viewpoint of the individual voter there is as much a dilution of his vote in the one case as in the other. So, in light of the Mosley and Bathgate cases, the test under  19 is not whether the acts in question constitute an interference with the effective choice of the voters. It is whether the voters are deprived of their votes in the general election. Such a test comports with the standards for construction of a criminal law, since it restricts  19 to protection of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 334]\n\u00a0\n the rights plainly and directly guaranteed by the Constitution. Any other test entails an inquiry into the indirect or incidental effect on the general election of the acts done. But in view of the generality of the words employed such a test would be incompatible with the criteria appropriate for a criminal case.\n The Mosley case, in my view, went to the verge when it held that  19 and the relevant constitutional provisions made it a crime to fail to count votes cast at a general election. That Congress intended  19 to have that effect was none too clear. The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Lamar in that case points out that  19 was originally part of the Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114,  6, 16 Stat. 140. Under another section of that act ( 4), which was repealed by the Act of February 8, 1894 (28 Stat. 36) the crime charged in the Mosley case would have been punishable by a fine of not less than $500 and imprisonment for 12 months. 2 Under  19 it carried, as it still does, a penalty of $5000 and ten years in prison. The Committee Report (H.Rep. No. 18, 53d Cong., 1st Sess.) which recommended the repeal of other sections clearly indicated an intent to remove the hand of the Federal Government from such elections and to restore their conduct and policing to the states. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 335]\n\u00a0\n As the Report stated (p. 7): 'Let every trace of the reconstruction measures be wiped from the statute books; let the States of this great Union understand that the elections are in their own hands, and if there be fraud, coercion, or force used they will be the first to feel it. Responding to a universal sentiment throughout the country for greater purity in elections many of our States have enacted laws to protect the voter and to purify the ballot. These, under the guidance of State officers, have worked efficiently, satisfactorily, and beneficently; and if these Federal statutes are repealed that sentiment will receive an impetus which, if the cause still exists, will carry such enactments in every State in the Union.' I view of this broad, comprehensive program of repeal it is not easy to conclude that the general language of  19 which was not repealed not only continued in effect much which had been repealed but also upped the penalties for certain offenses which had been explicitly covered by one of the repealed sections. Mr. Justice Holmes, writing for the majority in the Mosley case, found in the legislative and historical setting of  19 and in its revised form a Congressional interpretation which, if  19 were taken at its face value, was thought to afford voters in final Congressional elections general protection. And that view is a tenable one since  19 originally was part of an Act regulating general elections and since the acts charged had a direct rather than an indirect effect on the right to vote at a general election.\n But as stated by a unanimous court in United States v. Gradwell, supra, 243 U.S. page 486, 37 S.Ct. page 411, the Mosley case 'falls far short' of making  19 'applicable to the conduct of a state nominating primary'. Indeed, Mr. Justice Holmes, the author of the Mosley opinion, joined with Mr. Justice McReynolds in the Newberry case in his view that Congress had no authority under Art. I,  4 of the Constitution of legislate on primaries. When  19 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 336]\n\u00a0\n was part of the Act of May 31, 1870, it certainly would never have been contended that it embraced primaries, for they were hardly known at that time. \n3\n It is true that 'even a criminal statute embraces everything which subsequently falls within its scope.' Browder v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 335, 340\n, 61 S.Ct. 599, 602, 85 L.Ed. --. Yet the attempt to bring under  19 offenses 'committed in the conduct of primary elections or nominating caucuses or conventions' was rejected in the Gradwell case, where this Court said that in absence of legislation by Congress on the subject of primaries it is not for the courts 'to attempt to supply it by stretching old statutes to new uses, to which they are not adapted and for which they were not intended. ... the section of the Criminal Code relied upon, originally enacted for the protection of the civil rights of the then lately enfranchised negro, cannot be extended so as to make it an agency for enforcing a state primary law.' 243 U.S. pages 488, 489, 37 S.Ct. page 411, 412. The fact that primaries were hardly known when  19 was enacted, the fact that it was part of a legislative program governing general elections not primary elections, the fact that it has been in nowise implemented by legislation directed at primaries give credence to the unanimous view in the Gradwell case that  19 has not by the mere passage of time taken on a new and broadened meaning. At least it seems plain that the difficulties of applying the historical reason adduced by Mr. Justice Holmes in the Mosley case to bring general elections within  19 are so great in case of primaries that we have left the safety zone of interpretation of criminal statutes when we sustain this indictment. It is one thing to say, as in the Mosley case, that Congress was legislating as respects general elections when it passed  19. That was the fact. It is qu te \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 337]\n\u00a0\n another thing to say that Congress by leaving  19 unmolested for some seventy years has legislated unwittingly on primaries. Sec. 19 was never part of an act of Congress directed towards primaries. That was not its original frame of reference. Therefore, unlike the Mosley case, it cannot be said here that  19 still covers primaries because it was once an integral part of primary legislation.\n Furthermore, the fact that Congress has legislated only sparingly and at infrequent intervals even on the subject of general elections (United States v Gradwell, supra) should make us hesitate to conclude that by mere inaction Congress has taken the greater step, entered the field of primaries, and gone further than any announced legislative program has indicated. The acts here charged constitute crimes under the Louisiana statute. La.Act No. 46, Reg.Sess.1940,  89. In absence of specific Congressional action we should assume that Congress has left the control of primaries and nominating conventions to the states-an assumption plainly in line with the Committee Report, quoted above, recommending the repeal of portions of the Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870 so as to place the details of elections in state hands. There is no ground for inference in subsequent legislative history that Congress has departed from that policy by superimposing its own primary penal law on the primary penal laws of the states. Rather, Congress has been fairly consistent in recognizing state autonomy in the field of elections. To be sure, it has occasionally legislated on primaries. \n4\n But even when dealing specifically with the nominating process, it has never made acts of the kind here in question a crime. In this connection it should be noted that the bill which became the Hatch Act, 53 Stat. 1147, 18 U.S.C.  61 et seq., 18 U.S. C.A.  61 et seq., \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 338]\n\u00a0\n contained a section which made it unlawful 'for any person to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or to attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose, or of causing such other person to vote for or not to vote for any candidate for the nomination of any party as its candidate' for various federal offices including representatives 'at any primary or nominating convention held solely or in part' for that purpose. This was stricken in the Senate. 84 Cong.Rec., pt. 4, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4191. That section would have extended the same protection to the primary and nominating convention as  1 of the Hatch Act5 extends to the general election. The Senate, however, refused to do so. Yet this Court now holds that  19 has protected the primary vote all along and that it covers conspiracies to do the precise thing on which Congress refused to legislate in 1939. The hesitation on the part of Congress through the years to enter the primary field, its refusal to do so6 in 1939, and the restricted scope of such primary laws as it has passed should be ample evidence \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 339]\n\u00a0\n that this Court is legislating when it takes the initiative in extending  19 to primaries.\n We should adhere to the strict construction given to  19 by a unanimous court in United States v. Bathgate, supra, 246 U.S. page 226, 38 S.Ct. page 271, where it was said: 'Section 19, Criminal Code ..., of course, now has the same meaning as when first enacted ... and considering the policy of Congress not to interfere with elections within a state except by clear and specific provisions, together with the rule respecting construction of criminal statutes, we cannot think it was intended to apply to conspiracies to bribe voters.' That leads to the conclusion that  19 and the relevant constitutional provisions should be read so as to exclude all acts which do not have the direct effect of depriving voters of their right to vote at general elections. That view has received tacit recognition by Congress. For the history of legislation governing Federal elections shows that the occasional Acts of Congress7 on the subject have been primarily directed towards supplying detailed regulations designed to protect the individual's constitutional right to vote against pollution and corruption. Those laws, the latest of which is  1 of the Hatch Act, are ample recognition by Congress itself that specific legislation is necessary in order to protect the electoral process against the wide variety of acts which in their indirect or incidental effect interfere with the voter's freedom of choice and corrupt the electoral process. They are evidence that detailed regulations are essential in order to reach acts which do not directly interfere with the voting privilege. They are inconsistent with the notions in the opinion of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 340]\n\u00a0\n Court that the Constitution unaided by definite supplementary legislation protects the methods by which party candidates are nominated.\n That  19 lacks the requisite specificity necessary for inclusion of acts which interfere with the nomination of party candidates is reemphasized by the test here employed. The opinion of the Court stresses, as does the indictment, that the winner of the Democratic primary in Louisiana invariably carries the general election. It is also emphasized that a candidate defeated in the Louisiana primaries cannot be a candidate at the general election. Hence, it is argued that interference with the right to vote in such a primary is 'as a matter of law and in fact an interference with the effective choice of the voters at the only stage of the election procedure when their choice is of significance,' and that the 'primary in Louisiana is an integral part of the procedure for the popular choice' of representatives. By that means the Gradwell case is apparently distinguished. But I do not think it is a valid distinction for the purposes of this case.\n One of the indictments in the Gradwell case charged that the defendants conspired to procure one thousand unqualified persons to vote in a West Virginia primary for the nomination of a United States Senator. his Court, by a unanimous vote, affirmed the judgment which sustained a demurrer to that indictment. The Court specifically reserved the question as to whether a 'primary shall be treated as an election within the meaning of the Constitution'. But it went on to say that even assuming it were, certain 'strikingly unusual features' of the particular primary precluded such a holding in that case. It noted that candidates of certain parties were excluded from the primary and that even candidates who were defeated at the primary could on certain conditions be nominated for the general election. It therefore concluded that whatever power Congress might have to control such primaries, it had not done so by  19. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 299, 341]\n\u00a0\n If the Gradwell case is to survive, as I think it should, we have therefore this rather curious situation. Primaries in states where the winner invariably carries the general election are protected by  19 and the Constitution, even though such primaries are not by law an integral part of the election process. Primaries in states where the successful candidate never wins, seldom wins, or may not win in the general election are not so protected, unless perchance state law makes such primaries an integral part of the election process. Congress having a broad control over primaries might conceivably draw such distinctions in a penal code. But for us to draw them under  19 is quite another matter. For we must go outside the statute, examine local law and local customs, and then on the basis of the legal or practical importance of a particular primary interpret the vague language of  19 in the light of the significance of the acts done. The result is to make refined and nice distinctions which Congress certainly has not made, to create unevenness in the application of  19 among the various states, and to make the existence of a crime depend, not on the plain meaning of words employed interpreted in light of the legislative history of the statute, but on the result of research into local law or local practices. Unless Congress has explicitly made a crime dependent on such facts, we should not undertake to do so. Such procedure does not comport with the strict standards essential for the interpretation of a criminal law. The necessity of resorting to such a circuitous route is sufficient evidence to me that we are performing a legislative function in finding here a definition of a crime which will sustain this indictment. A crime, no matter how offensive, should not be spelled out from such vague inferences.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The ballots are printed at public expense,  35 of Act No. 46, Regular Session, 1940, are furnished by the Secretary of State,  36 in a form prescribed by statute,  37.

Its failure to deal with the subject seems to be attributable to constitutional doubts, stimulated by Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232\n, 41 S.Ct. 469, which are here resolved. See 84 Cong.Rec., 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4191; cf. Investigation of Campaign Expenditures in the 1940 Campaign, S.Rept. No. 47, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 48. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Section 20 of the Criminal Code, U.S.C., Title 18, Sec. 52, 18 U.S. C.A.  52:\n'Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects, or causes to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such inhabitant being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be find not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.' (R.S.  5510; Mar. 4, 1909, c. 321,  20, 35 Stat. 1092). \n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The precursor of  20 was  2 of the Civil Rights Act of April 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which reads:\n'That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of any right secured or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains, or penalties on account of such person having at any time been held in a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason of his color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be punished by fine ....'\n\n This section, so far as now material, was in substance the same as  20 except that the qualifying reference to differences in punishment made no mention of alienage, the reference being to 'different punishment ... on account of such person having at any time been held in a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude'.\n Senator Trumbull, the putative author of S. 61, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported the bill, in explaining it stated that the bill was 'to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights and furnishes the means of their vindication. ...' Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 211. He also declared, 'The bill applies to white men as well as black men'. Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 599. Opponents of the bill agreed with this construction of the first clause of the section, declaring that it referred to the deprivation of constitutional rights of all inhabitants of the states of every race and color. Pp. 598, 601.\n On February 24, 1870, Senator Stewart of Nevada, introduced S. 365, 41st Cong., 2d Sess.,  2 of which read:\n'That any person who under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom shall subject, or cause to be subjected any inhabitant or any State or Territory to the deprivation of any rights secured or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains, or penalties on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. ...' \n\n In explaining the bill he declared, Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1536, that the purpose of the bill was to extend its benefits to aliens, saying, 'It extends the operation of the Civil Rights Bill, which is well known in the Senate and to the country, to all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.' The Committee reported out a substitute bill to H.R. 1293, to which S. 365 was added as an amendment. As so amended the bill when adopted became the present  20 of the Criminal Code which read exactly as did  2 of the Civil Rights Act, except that the word 'aliens' was added and the word 'citizens' was substituted for the phrase 'white persons'.\n While the legislative history indicates that the immediate occasion for the adoption of  20, like the Fourteenth Amendment itself, was the more adequate protection of the colored race and their civil rights, it shows that neither was restricted to that purpose and that the first clause of  20 was intended to protect the constitutional rights of all inhabitants of the states. H.R. 1293, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., which was later amended in the Senate to include  2 of S. 365 as  17 of the bill as it passed, now  20 of the Criminal Code, was originally entitled 'A bill to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote in the several states of this Union who have hitherto been denied that right on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude'. When the bill came to the Senate its title was amended and adopted to read, 'A bill to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote in the several states of this Union and for other purposes.' \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] While  19 also refers to 'laws of the United States',  19 and  20 are the only statutes directly in point. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 5506, Rev.Stat.: 'Every person who, by any unlawful means, hinders, delays, prevents, or obstructs, or combines and confederates with others to hinder, delay, prevent, or obstruct, any citizen from doing any act required to be done to qualify him to vote, or from voting at any election ... shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not less than one month nor more than one year, or be punished by both such fine and imprisonment.'

Margold, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joyce Cox, of Houston, Tex., and Max Radin, of Berkeley, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States, in its own right and as guardian of the Indians of the Walapai (Hualpai) Tribe in Arizona, 28 U.S. C.  41(1),  24, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(a), to enjoin respondent from interfering with the possession and occupancy by the Indians of certain land in northwestern Arizona. Respondent claims full title to the lands in question under the grant to its predecessor, the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Co., provided for in the Act of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 292. The bill sought to establish that respondent's rights under the grant of 1866 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n are subject to the Indians' right of occupancy both inside and outside their present reservation which was established by the Executive Order of President Arthur, January 4, 1883. The bill consists of two causes of action-the first relating to lands inside, and the second, to lands outside, that reservation. The bill prayed, inter alia, that title be quieted and that respondent 'account for all rents, issues and profits derived from the leasing, renting or use of the lands subject to said right of occupaycy' by the Indians. Respondent moved to dismiss on the ground that the facts alleged were 'insufficient to constitute a valid cause of action in equity'. The District Court granted that motion. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 114 F.2d 420. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n312 \nU.S. 675\n, 61 S.Ct. 738, because of the importance of the problems raised in the administration of the Indian laws and the land grants.\n Sec. 2 of the Act of July 27, 1866, the Act under which respondent's title to the lands in question derived,1 provided: 'The United States shall extinguish, as rapidly as may be consistent with public policy and the welfare of the Indians, and only by their voluntary cession, the Indian title to all lands falling under the operation of this act and acquired in the donation to the road named in the act.'\n Basic to the present causes of action is the theory that the lands in question were the ancestral home of the Walapais, that such occupancy constituted 'Indian title' within the meaning of  2 of the 1866 Act, which the United States agreed to extinguish, and that in absence of such extinguishment the grant to the railroad 'conveyed \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 345]\n\u00a0\n the fee subject to this right of occupancy'. Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, \n119 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 7 S.Ct. 100, 104. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the United States had never recognized such possessory rights of Indians within the Mexican Cession2 and that in absence of such recognition the Walapais had no such right good against grantees of the United States.\n Occupancy necessary to establish aboriginal possession is a question of fact to be determined as any other question of fact. If it were established as a fact that the lands in question were, or were included in, the ancestral home of the Walapais in the sense that they constituted definable territory occupied exclusively by the Walapais (as distinguished from lands wandered over by many tribes), then the Walapais had 'Indian title' which unless extinguished survived the railroad grant of 1866. Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, supra.\n'Unquestionably it has been the policy of the federal government from the beginning to respect the Indian right of occupancy, which could only be interfered with or determined by the United States.' Cramer v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 219, 227\n, 43 S.Ct. 342, 344. This policy was first recognized in Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543, and has been repeatedly reaffirmed. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515; Mitchel v. United States, 9 Pet. 711; Chouteau v. Molony, 16 How. 203; Holden v. Joy, 17 Wall. 211; Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, supra; United States v. Shoshone Tribe, \n304 \nU.S. 111\n, 58 S.Ct. 794. As stated in Mitchel v. United States, supra, 9 Pet. at page 746, Indian 'right of occupancy is considered as sacred as the fee-simple of the whites.' Whatever may have been the rights of the Walapais under Spanish law, the Cramer case assumed that lands within the Mexican Cession were not excepted from the policy to respect Indian right of occupancy. Though the Cramer \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 346]\n\u00a0\n case involved the problem of individual Indian occupancy, this Court stated that such occupancy was not to be treated differently from 'the original nomadic tribal occupancy'. 261 U.S. at page 227, 43 S.Ct. at page 344. Perhaps the assumption that aboriginal possession would be respected in the Mexican Cession was, like the generalizations in Johnson v. M'Intosh, supra, not necessary for the narrow holding of the case. But such generalizations have been so often and so long repeated as respects land under the prior sovereignty of the various European nations including Spain,3 that like other rules governing titles to property ( United States v. Title Insurance & Trust Co., \n265 \nU.S. 472, 486\n, 487 S., 44 S. Ct. 621, 623) they should now be considered no longer open. Furthermore treaties4 negotiated with Indian tribes, wholly or partially within the Mexican Cession, for delimitation of their occupancy rights or for the settlement and adjustment of their boundaries, constitute clear recognition that no different policy as respects aboriginal possession obtained in this area than in other areas. And see United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 381\n, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 1112. Certainly it would take plain and unambiguous action to deprive the Walapais of the benefits of that policy. For it was founded on the desire to maintain just and peaceable relations with Indians. The reasons for its application to other tribes are no less apparent in case of the Walapais, a savage tribe which in early days caused the military no end of trouble. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 347]\n\u00a0\n Nor is it true, as respondent urges, that a tribal claim to any particular lands must be based upon a treaty, statute, or other formal government action. As stated in the Cramer case, 'The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.' 261 U.S. at page 229, 43 S.Ct. at page 344.\n\n Extinguishment of Indian title based on aboriginal possession is of course a different matter. The power of Congress in that regard is supreme. The manner, method and time of such extinguishment raise political not justiciable issues. Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, supra, 119 U.S. at page 66, 7 S.Ct. at page 104. As stated by Chief Justice Marshall in Johnson v. M'Intosh, supra, 8 Wheat. at page 586, 'the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish' Indian title has never been doubted. And whether it be done by treaty, by the sword, by purchase, by the exercise of complete dominion adverse to the right of occupancy, or otherwise, its justness is not open to inquiry in the courts. Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 \nU.S. 517\n, 525.\n If the right of occupancy of the Walapais was not extinguished prior to the date of definite location of the railroad in 1872, then the respondent's predecessor took the fee subject to the encumbrance of Indian title. Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, supra. For on that date the title of respondent's predecessor attached as of July 27, 1866. United States v. Southern Pacific R.R. Co., \n146 \nU.S. 570\n, 13 S.Ct. 152; Nelson v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n188 \nU.S. 108\n, 23 S.Ct. 302.\n Certainly prior to 1865 any right of occupancy of the Walapais to the lands in question was not extinguished; nor was the policy of respecting such Indian title changed. The Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of June 30, 1834, 4 Stat. 729, was extended over 'the Indian tribes in the Territories of New Mexico and Utah' by  7 of the Act of February 27, 1851, 9 Stat. 574, 587. The 1834 Act, which derived from the Act of July 22, 1790, 1 Stat. 137, made it an offense to drive stock to range or feed 'on any land \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 348]\n\u00a0\n belonging to any Indian or Indian tribe without the consent of such tribe' ( 9); gave the superintendent of Indian affairs authority 'to remove from the Indian country all persons found therein contrary to law' ( 10); made it unlawful to settle on 'any lands belonging, secured, or granted by treaty with the United States to any Indian tribe' ( 11); and made invalid any conveyance of lands 'from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians.'  12. The Act of 1851 obviously did not create any Indian right of occupancy which did not previously exist. But it plainly indicates that in 1851 Congress desired to continue in these territories the unquestioned general policy of the Federal government to recognize such right of occupancy. As stated by Chief Justice Marshall in Worcester v. Georgia, supra, 6 Pet. at page 557, the Indian trade and intercourse acts 'manifestly consider the several Indian nations as distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, which which their authority is exclusive, and having a right to all the lands within those boundaries, which is not only acknowledged, but guarantied by the United States.'\n The court below laid considerable stress upon the Act of July 22, 1854, 10 Stat. 308, as indicating that Congress recognized no rights of the Indians in Arizona and New Mexico other than those existing under Mexican law or created by reservations after the Mexican Cession. But we do not agree that, so far as the respondent's rights are concerned, that Act instituted a policy of non-recognition of Indian title. Nor do we think that it effected any extinguishment of that title.\n The Act of 1854 established the office of Surveyor General of New Mexico. It donated land to certain qualified citizens ( 2) with the exception, inter alia, of 'military or other reservations'.  4. Unlike the Pre-Emption Act of September 4, 1841,  10, 5 Stat. 453, the 1854 Act did not extend only to 'the public lands to which the Indian \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 349]\n\u00a0\n title had been at the time of such settlement extinguished.' It did provide, however, that 'any of the lands not taken' under it should 'be subject to the operation' of the Pre-Emption Act.  7. Moreover, the 1854 Act provided as respects the Territories of Nebraska and Kansas that the grants should extend only to lands 'to which the Indian title has been or shall be extinguished.'  12.\n From that it is argued that since Congress recognized Indian title in Nebraska and Kansas and under the Pre-Emption Act but did not recognize it as respects the lands in this area, a shift of policy in the Mexican Cession was indicated. The issue here, however, is not between a settler claiming under the 1854 Act and the Walapais. Whether in such a case the 1854 Act should be construed as extinguishing any Indian title to land taken under it we need not decide. \n5\n Respondent does not claim under that Act and hence can derive no rights from it.\n Some stress is likewise placed on  8 of the Act of July 22, 1854, and on the Act of July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 291, 304. The former required the Surveyor General for New Mexico 'to ascertain the origin, nature, character, and extent of all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico'; and to make a report 'on all such claims as originated before the cession of the territory to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ... denoting the various grades of title, with his decision as to the validity or invalidty of each of the same under the laws, usages, and customs of the country before its cession to the United States.' Such report was to be 'laid before Congress for such action thereon as may be deemed just and proper, with a view to confirm bona \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 350]\n\u00a0\n fide grants, and give full effect' to the treaty. It was also provided that 'until the final action of Congress on such claims, all lands covered thereby shall be reserved from sale or other disposal by the government, and shall not be subject to the donations granted by the previous provisions of this act.' The 1870 Act directed the Surveyor General for Arizona (which was separated as a Territory from New Mexico in 1863, 12 Stat. 664) 'to ascertain and report upon the origin, nature, character, and extent of the claims to lands in said Territory under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico.' His report was to be 'laid before Congress for such action thereon as shall be deemed just and proper.'\n These Acts did not extinguish any Indian title based on aboriginal occupancy which the Walapais may have had. In that respect they were quite different from the Act of March 3, 1851, 9 Stat. 631, passed to ascertain and settle certain land claims in California. Under  13 of that Act 'all lands the claims to which shall not have been presented' to the commissioners, appointed to receive and act upon all petitions for confirmation of land claims, 'within two years after the date of this act, shall be deemed, held, and considered as part of the public domain of the United States.' This Court passed on that Act in Barker v. Harvey, \n181 \nU.S. 481\n, 21 S.Ct. 690. The plaintiff there claimed under two Mexican grants. The defendants were Indians who claimed a right of permanent occupancy; but they had not presented their claims to the commissioners within the time specified by  13. This Court held that as a result of that failure their claims were barred. And see United States v. Title Insurance & Trust Co., supra. That is to say, the Act of 1851 was interpreted as containing machinery for extinguishment of claims, including those based on Indian right of occupancy. Since Congress had provided a method for extinguishment, its appropriateness raised only a political \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 351]\n\u00a0\n not a justiciable issue. The Acts of 1854 and 1870, unlike the Act of 1851, merely called for a report to Congress on certain land claims. If there was an extinguishment of the rights of the Walapais, it resulted not from action of the Surveyor General but from action of Congress based on his reports. \n6\n We are not advised that Congress took any such action. In its absence we must conclude that these Acts were concerned not with the problem of ascertaining the boundaries of Indian country but with the problem of quieting titles originating under Spanish or Mexican grants. For it should be noticed that  8 of the 1854 Act contemplated confirmation by Congess of 'bona fide grants'.\n This brings us to the Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 541, 559, which provided: 'All that part of the public domain in the Territory of Arizona, lying west of a direct line from Half-Way Bend to Corner Rock on the Colorado River, containing about seventy-five thousand acres of land, shall be set apart for an Indian reservation for the Indians of said river and its tributaries.' It is plain that the Indians referred to included the Walapais. The suggestion for removing various Indian tribes in this area to a reservation apparently originated with a former Indian agent, Superintendent Poston, who was a Territorial Representative in Congress in 1865. His explanation7 on the floor of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 352]\n\u00a0\n House of the bill, which resulted in the creation of the 1865 reservation, indicates that he had called a council of the confederated tribes of the Colorado, including the Walapais, and had told them that 'they should abandon' their lands and confine themselves to the place on the Colorado river which was later proposed for a reservation. He entered into no agreement with them nor did he propose a treaty. He merely stated that if elected to Congress he would try to get Congress to provide for them. As stated by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1864: 'Assuming that the Indians have a right of some kind to the soil, Mr. Poston's arrangement proposes a compromise with these Indians, by which on their confining themselves to their reservation and yielding all claims to lands beyond it, they shall, in lieu of an annuity in money or supplies, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 353]\n\u00a0\n be furnished by government with an irrigating canal, at a cost estimated at something near $100,000 which, by insuring them their annual crops, will enable them to support themselves, independently of other aid by the government.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n We search the public records in vain for any clear and plain indication that Congress in creating the Colorado River reservation was doing more than making an offer to the Indians, including the Walapais, which it was hoped would be accepted as a compromise of a troublesome question. We find no indication that Congress by creating that reservation intended to extinguish all of the rights which the Walapais had in their ancestral home. \n9\n That \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 354]\n\u00a0\n Congress could have effected such an extinguishment is not doubted. But an extinguishment cannot be lightly implied in view of the avowed solicitude of the Federal Government for the welfare of its Indian wards. As stated in Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 675\n, 32 S.Ct. 565, 569, the rule of construction recognized without exception for over a century has been that 'doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in favor of the United States, are to be resolved in favor of a weak and defenseless people, who are wards of the nation, and dependent wholly upon its protection and good faith.' And see Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 395\n, 396 S., 22 S.Ct. 650, 658, 659. Nor was there any plain intent or agreement on the part of the Walapais to abandon their ancestral lands if Congress would create a reservation. Furthermore, the Walapais did not accept the offer which Congress had tendered. In 1874 they were, however, forcibly removed to the Colorado River reservation on order from the Indian Department. \n10\n But they left it in a body the next year. \n11\n And it was decided 'to allow them to remain in their old range during good behavior.' \n12\n They did thereafter remain in their old country and en- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 355]\n\u00a0\n gaged in no hostilities against the whites. No further attempt was made to force them onto the Colorado River reservation, even though Congress had made various appropriations to defray the costs of locating the Arizona Indians in permanent abodes (Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 541, 559; Act of July 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 198, 219; Act of July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 335, 357), including the Colorado River reservation. Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 492, 515; Act of May 29, 1872, 17 Stat. 165, 188. On these facts we conclude that the creation of the Colorado River reservation was, so far as the Walapais were concerned, nothing more than an abortive attempt to solve a perplexing problem. Their forcible removal in 1874 was not pursuant to any mandate of Congress. It was a high-handed endeavor to wrest from these Indians lands which Congress had never declared forfeited. 13 No forfeiture can be \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 356]\n\u00a0\n predicated on an unauthorized attempt to effect a forcible settlement on the reservation unless we are to be insensitive to the high standards for fair dealing in light of which laws dealing with Indian rights have long been read. Certainly a forced abandonment of their ancestral home was not a 'voluntary cession' within the meaning of  2 of the Act of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 294. Atlantic & Pacific R.R. Co. v. Mingus, \n165 \nU.S. 413, 438\n, 439 S., 17 S.Ct. 348, 355.\n The situation was, however, quite different in 1881. Between 1875 and that date there were rather continuous suggestions for settling the Walapais on some reservation. \n14\n In 1881 the matter came to a head. A majority of the tribe, 'in council assembled', asked an officer of the United States Army in that region 'to aid them and represent to the proper authorities' the following proposal:15 'They say that in the country, over which they used to roam so free, the white men have appropriated all the water; that large numbers of cattle have been introduced and have rapidly increased during the past year or two; that in many places the water is fenced in and locked up; and they are driven from all waters. They say that the Railroad is now coming which will require more water, and will bring more men who will take up all the small springs remaining. They urge that the following reservation be set aside for them while there is still \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 357]\n\u00a0\n time; that the land can never be of any great use to the Whites; that there are no mineral deposits upon it, as it has been thoroughly prospected; that there is little or no arable land; that the water is in such small quantities, and the country is so rocky and void of grass, that it would not be available for stock raising. I am credibly informed, and from my observations believe, the above facts to be true. I, therefore, earnestly recommend that the hereafter described Reservation be, at as early a date as practicable, set aside for them.'\n Pursuant to that recommendation the military reservation was constituted on July 8, 1881, subject to the approval of the President. \n16\n The Executive Order creating the Walapai Indian Reservation was signed by President Arthur on January 4, 1883.17 There was an indication that the Indians were satisfied with the proposed reservation. \n18\n A few of them thereafter lived on the reservation; many of them did not. \n19\n While suggestions recurred for the creation of a new and different reservation, 20 this one was not abandoned. For a long time it remained unsurveyed. \n21\n Cattle men used it for grazing and for some years the Walapais received little benefit from it. \n22\n But in view of all of the circumstances, we conclude that its creation at the request of the Walapais and its acceptance by them amounted to a relinquishment of any tribal claims \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 358]\n\u00a0\n to lands23 which they might have had outside that reservation and that that relinquishment was tantamount to an extinguishment by 'voluntary cession' within the meaning of  2 of the Act of July 27, 1866. The lands were fast being populated. The Walapais saw their old domain being preempted. They wanted a reservation while there was still time to get one. That solution had long seemed desirable in view of recurring tension between the settlers and the Walapais. In view of the long standing attempt to settle the Walapais' problem by placing them on a reservation their acceptance of this reservation must be regarded in law as the equivalent of a release of any tribal rights which they may have had in lands outside the reservation. They were in substance acquiescing in the penetration of white settlers on condition that permanent provision was made for them too. In view of this historical setting, it cannot now be fairly implied that tribal rights of the Walapais in lands outside the reservation were preserved. That would make the creation of the 1883 reservation, as an attempted solution of the violent problems created when two civilizations met in this area, illusory indeed. We must give it the definitiveness which the exigencies of that situation seem to demand. Hence, acquiescence in that arrangement must be deemed to have been a relinquishment of tribal rights in lands outside the reservation and notoriously claimed by others. Cf. Marsh v. Brooks, 14 How. 513; Shoshone Tribe v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 476\n, 57 S.Ct. 244.\n On January 23, 1941, the date of the filing of this petition for certiorari, respondent quit claimed to the United States, under  321(b), Title III of the Interstate Commerce Act, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 359]\n\u00a0\n Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 929, 954, 49 U.S.C.A.  66(b), all lands claimed by it under the Act of July 27, 1866, within the Walapai Indian Reservation. Since the decree below must stand as to the second cause of action and since by virtue of the quitclaim deeds the United States has received all the lands to which the first cause of actions relates, the decree will not be reversed. It is apparent, however, that it must be modified so as to permit the accounting as respects lands in the first cause of action. It does not appear whether those lands were included in the ancestral home of the Walapais in the sense that they were in whole or in part occupied exclusively by them or whether they were lands wandered over by many tribes. As we have said, occupancy necessary to establish aboriginal possession is a question of fact. The United States is entitled to an accounting as respects any or all of the lands in the first cause of action which the Walapais did in fact occupy exclusively from time immemorial. \n24\n Such an accounting is not precluded by the Act of February 20, 1925, 43 Stat. 954, which authorized the Secretary of the Interior 'to accept reconveyances to the Government of privately owned and State school lands and relinquishments of any valid filings, under the homestead laws, or of other valid claims within the Walapai Indian Reservation'. The implication is that there may be some land within the reservation that is not subject to Indian occupancy. But that Act certainly cannot be taken as an extinguishment of any and all Indian title that did exist or as a repeal by implication of  2 of the Act of July 27, 1866, requiring such extinguishment by 'voluntary cession'. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 339, 360]\n\u00a0\n It was passed so that lands 'retained for Indian purposes may be consolidated and held in a solid area so far as may be possible.' \n25\n Such statements by the Secretary of the Interior as that 'title to the odd- numbered sections' was in the respondent26 do not estop the United States from maintaining this suit. For they could not deprive the Indians of their rights any more than could the unauthorized leases in Cramer v. United States, supra.\n Hence an accounting as respects such lands in the reservation which can be proved to have been occupied by the Walapais from time immemorial can be had. To the extent that the decree below precludes such proof and accounting, it will be modified. And as so modified, it is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Earlier cases involving this grant are United States v. Southern Pacific R.R.

Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 854. Sec. 15 of that Act repealed  8 of the Act of 1854. Under  13 of the 1891 Act it was provided: 'No claim shall be allowed that shall interfere with or overthrow any just and unextinguished Indian title or right to any land or place.' \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess., March 2, 1865, p. 1320:\n'As superintendent of Indian affairs, I called the confederated tribes of the Colorado in council together. The council was attended by the principal chiefs and headmen of the Yumas, Mojaves, Yapapais, Hualapais, and Chemihuevis. These tribes have an aggregate of ten thousand souls living near the banks of the Colorado, from Fort Yuma to Fort Mojave . ... \n\n'But as the representative of the Government of the United States at that time, I did not undertake to make a written treaty with these Indians, because I considered that the Government was able and willing to treat them fairly and honestly without entering into the form of a written treaty, which has been heretofore so severely criticised in both Houses of Congress, and with some reason. These Indians there assembled were willing, for a small amount of beef and flour, to have signed any treaty which it had been my pleasure to write. I simply proposed to them that for all the one hundred and twenty thousand square miles, full of mines and rich enough to pay the public debt of the United States, they should abandon that Territory and confine themselves to the elbow in the Colorado river, not more than seventy-five thousand acres. But I did not enter into any obligation on account of the United States to furnish them with seeds and agricutural implements. I simply told them that if I was elected to represent that Territory in this Congress, I would endeavor to lay their claims before the Government, which they understood to be magnanimous, and that I hoped that this Congress would have the generosity and the justice to provide for these Indians, who have been robbed of their lands and their means of subsistence, and that they may be allowed to live there where they have always made their homes. They desire to live as do the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico and Arizona. Those Pueblo Indians live in settlements, in towns, in reservations, according to the wise policy of the Spanish Government, which colonized the Indians in reservations and made their labor valuable in building improvements for their own sustenance, for churches, and public improvements, and in that manner made them peaceable Indians, instead of having everlasting and eternal war with the people whom they had robbed of their land.\n\n'These people having been citizens of the Mexican Government, are not, according to our theory, entitled to any right in the soil; and therefore no treaty with these Indians for the extinction of their title to the soil would be recognized by this Government. It is a fiction of law which these Indians, in their ignorance, are not able to understand. They cannot see why the Indians of the Northeast have been paid annuities since the foundation of this Government for the extinction of their title, while the Indians who were formerly subject to the Spanish and Mexican Governments are driven from their lands without a dollar. It is impossible for these simple-minded people to understand this sophistry. They consider themselves just as much entitled to the land which their ancestors inhabited before ours landed on Plymouth Rock as the Indians of the Northeast. They have never signed any treaty relinquishing their right to the public domain.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Report of the Secretary of the Interior, Dec. 5, 1864, p. 165. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Respondent also places some stress on the Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 19, in which Congress permitted respondent's predecessor to mortgage its property. But as stated in Leavenworth, L. & G.R.R. Co. v. United States, \n92 \nU.S. 733\n, 753, '... title to lands is not strengthened by giving a mortgage upon them; nor can the fact that it has been given throw any light upon the prior estate of the mortgagor.' And see Atlantic & Pacific R.R. Co. v. Mingus, \n165 \nU.S. 413, 430\n, 17 S.Ct. 348, 352, where this Court in speaking of the purpose of the Act of April 20, 1871, said: 'The original act being silent upon the subject of mortgaging the grant, there is reason to suppose that congress passed the act for the purpose of resolving any doubts that capitalists may have entertained with respect to such power. The mortgagees, standing in the place of the mortgagor, had no greater rights than it had, and must be held to have known that they were taking an estate which was defeasible upon condition broken. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Walapai Papers, S.

General Schofield reported on May 24, 1875, to the Adjutant General as follows:\n'The Hualpai Indians have been our firm friends for many years, and our active allies whenever their services have been required against the hostile Apaches. In return for their fidelity they have been treated with great injustice and cruelty. They were forced to leave their homes in the mountains and go upon a reservation in the Colorado desert, where they have suffered from the extreme heat, to which they were unaccustomed, from disease, and from hunger.\n\n'This was done in spite of the protest of the Military commanders who were familiar with the wants of these Indians and were anxious to repay by kind treatment the faithful services they had rendered. The Indians were bitterly opposed to this change, and it was only the great influence which Gen'l. Crook and Captain Byrne had acquired over them that enabled the removal to be made without war.\n\n'The Indian Agent, having seen fit no relinquish the aid of this powerful influence, the effect was at once manifest in the return of the Hualpais to their former homes.\n\n'I am decidedly opposed to the use of any coercive measures to force them back upon the Colorado reservation.\n\n'The injustice and bad faith shown by the government toward the Hualpais and the Indians which Gen'l. Crook had collected upon the Verde reservation are calculated to undo as far as possible the good work which Gen'l. Crook and his troops had accomplished with so much wisdom and gallantry. It is useless to attempt to disguise the fact that such treatment of the Indians is in violation of the just and humane policy prescribed by the President and a disgrace to any civilized country.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Walapai Papers, op. cit., pp. 113-131. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] Walapai Papers, op. cit., pp. 134, 135.

DARBY(1941)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n As Amended Feb. 17, 1941\n\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Francis Biddle, Sol. Gen., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Archibald B. Lovett, of Savannah, Ga., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 108]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The two principal questions raised by the record in this case are, first, whether Congress has constitutional power to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce of lumber manufactured by employees whose wages are less than a prescribed minimum or whose weekly hours of labor at that wage are greater than a prescribed maximum, and, second, whether it has power to prohibit the employment of workmen in the production of goods 'for interstate commerce' at other than prescribed wages and hours. A subsidiary question is whether in connection with such prohibitions Congress can require the employer subject to them to keep records showing the hours worked each day and week by each of his employees including those engaged 'in the production and manufacture of goods to wit, lumber, for 'interstate commerce.\"\n Appellee demurred to an indictment found in the district court for southern Georgia charging him with violation of  15(a)(1)(2) and (5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.  201, et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq. The district court sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment and the case comes here on direct appeal under  238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 109]\n\u00a0\n U.S.C.A.  345, and  682, Title 18 U.S.C., 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S.C.A.  682, which authorizes an appeal to this Court when the judgment sustaining the demurrer 'is based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded'.\n The Fair Labor Standards Act set up a comprehensive legislative scheme for preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of certain products and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions as respects wages and hours which fail to conform to standards set up by the Act. Its purpose, as we judicially know from the declaration of policy in  2(a) of the Act,1 and the reports of Congressional committees proposing the legislation, S.Rept. No. 884, 75th Cong. 1st Sess .; H.Rept. No. 1452, 75th Cong. 1st Sess.; H.Rept. No. 2182, 75th Cong. 3d Sess., Conference Report, H.Rept. No. 2738, 75th Cong. 3d Sess., is to exclude from interstate commerce goods produced for the commerce and to prevent their production for interstate commerce, under conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standards of living necessary for health and general well-being; and to prevent the use of interstate \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 110]\n\u00a0\n commerce as the means of competition in the distribution of goods so produced, and as the means of spreading and perpetuating such substandard labor conditions among the workers of the several states. The Act also sets up an administrative procedure whereby those standards may from time to time be modified generally as to industries subject to the Act or within an industry in accordance with specified standards, by an administrator acting in collaboration with 'Industry Committees' appointed by him.\n Section 15 of the statute prohibits certain specified acts and  16(a) punishes willful violation of it by a fine of not more than $10,000 and punishes each conviction after the first by imprisonment of not more than six months or by the specified fine or both. Section 15(a)(1) makes unlawful the shipment in interstate commerce of any goods 'in the production of which any employee was employed in violation of section 6( 206) or section 7(207)', which provide, among other things, that during the first year of operation of the Act a minimum wage of 25 cents per hour shall be paid to employees 'engaged in (interstate) commerce or in the production of goods for (interstate) commerce,'  6, and that the maximum hours of employment for employees 'engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce' without increased compensation for overtime, shall be forty-four hours a week.  7.\n Section 15(a)(2) makes it unlawful to violate the provisions of  6 and 7 including the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements just mentioned for employees engaged in production of goods for commerce. Section 15(a)(5) makes it unlawful for an employer subject to the Act to violate  11(c) which requires him to keep such records of the persons employed by him and of their wages and hours of employment as the administrator shall prescribe by regulation or order. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 111]\n\u00a0\n The indictment charges that appellee is engaged, in the state of Georgia, in the business of acquiring raw materials, which he manufactures into finished lumber with the intent, when manufactured, to ship it in interstate commerce to customers outside the state, and that he does in fact so ship a large part of the lumber so produced. There are numerous counts charging appellee with the shipment in interstate commerce from Georgia to points outside the state of lumber in the production of which, for interstate commerce, appellee has employed workmen at less than the prescribed minimum wage or more than the prescribed maximum hours without payment to them of any wage for overtime. Other counts charge the employment by appellee of workmen in the production of lumber for interstate commerce at wages of less than 25 cents an hour or for more than the maximum hours per week without payment to them of the prescribed overtime wage. Still another count charges appellee with failure to keep records showing the hours worked each day a week by each of his employees as required by  11(c) and the regulation of the administrator, Title 29, Ch. 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 516, and also that appellee unlawfully failed to keep such records of employees engaged 'in the production and manufacture of goods, to-wit lumber, for interstate commerce'.\n The demurrer, so far as now relevant to the appeal, challenged the validity of the Fair Labor Standards Act under the Commerce Clause, Art. 1 ,  8, cl. 3, and the Fifth and Tenth Amendments. The district court quashed the indictment in its entirety upon the broad grounds that the Act, which it interpreted as a regulation of manufacture within the states, is unconstitutional. It declared that manufacture is not interstate commerce and that the regulation by the Fair Labor Standards Act of wages and hours of employment of those engaged in the manufac- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 112]\n\u00a0\n ture of goods which it is intended at the time of production 'may or will be' after production 'sold in interstate commerce in part or in whole' is not within the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.\n The effect of the court's decision and judgment are thus to deny the power of Congress to prohibit shipment in interstate commerce of lumber produced for interstate commerce under the proscribed substandard labor conditions of wages and hours, its power to penalize the employer for his failure to conform to the wage and hour provisions in the case of employees engaged in the production of lumber which he intends thereafter to ship in interstate commerce in part or in whole according to the normal course of his business and its power to compel him to keep records of hours of employment as required by the statute and the regulations of the administrator.\n The case comes here on assignments by the Government that the district court erred insofar as it held that Congress was without constitutional power to penalize the acts set forth in the indictment, and appellees seek to sustain the decision below on the grounds that the prohibition by Congress of those Acts is unauthorized by the commerce clause and is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment. The appeals statute limits our jurisdiction on this appeal to a review of the determination of the district court so far only as it is based on the validity or construction of the statute. United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 193\n, 195 S., 60 S.Ct. 182, 185, 186, and cases cited. Hence we accept the district court's interpretation of the indictment and confine our decision to the validity and construction of the statute.\n The prohibition of shipment of the proscribed goods in interstate commerce. Section 15(a)(1) prohibits, and the indictment charges, the shipment in interstate commerce, of goods produced for interstate commerce by employees whose wages and hours of employment do not \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 113]\n\u00a0\n conform to the requirements of the Act. Since this section is not violated unless the commodity shipped has been produced under labor conditions prohibited by  6 and  7, the only question arising under the commerce clause with respect to such shipments is whether Congress has the constitutional power to prohibit them.\n While manufacture is not of itself interstate commerce the shipment of manufactured goods interstate is such commerce and the prohibition of such shipment by Congress is indubitably a regulation of the commerce. The power to regulate commerce is the power 'to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed'. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196. It extends not only to those regulations which aid, foster and protect the commerce, but embraces those which prohibit it. Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S.Ct. 92; Lottery Case (Champion v.

Brown, \n286 \nU.S. 131\n, 52 S.Ct. 522, 87 A.L.R. 448. It is conceded that the power of Congress to prohibit transportation in interstate commerce includes noxious articles, Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45\n, 31 S.Ct. 364; cf. Hoke v. United States, supra; stolen articles, Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432\n, 45 S.Ct. 345, 37 A.L.R. 1407; Kidnapped persons, Gooch v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 124\n, 56 S.Ct. 395, and articles such as intoxicating liquor or convict made goods, traffic in which is forbidden or restricted by the laws of the state of destination. Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n299 \nU.S. 334\n, 57 S.Ct. 277.\n But it is said that the present prohibition falls within the scope of none of these categories; that while the prohibition is nominally a regulation of the commerce its motive or purpose is regulation of wages and hours of persons engaged in manufacture, the control of which has been reserved to the states and upon which Georgia \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 114]\n\u00a0\n and some of the states of destination have placed no restriction; that the effect of the present statute is not to exclude the prescribed articles from interstate commerce in aid of state regulation as in Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra, but instead, under the guise of a regulation of interstate commerce, it undertakes to regulate wages and hours within the state contrary to the policy of the state which has elected to leave them unregulated.\n The power of Congress over interstate commerce 'is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed by the constitution.' Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, 9 Wheat. 196. That power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power. Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra. Congress, following its own conception of public policy concerning the restrictions which may appropriately be imposed on interstate commerce, is free to exclude from the commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, even though the state has not sought to regulate their use. Reid v. Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, supra; Hoke v. United States, supra.\n Such regulation is not a forbidden invasion of state power merely because either its motive or its consequence is to restrict the use of articles of commerce within the states of destination and is not prohibited unless by other Constitutional provisions. It is no objection to the assertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states. Seven Cases v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 514\n, 36 S.Ct. 190, 191; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 40 S.Ct. 106, 108; United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 115]\n\u00a0\n 144, 147, 58 S.Ct. 778, 780; United States v. Appalachian Electric Power Co., \n311 \nU.S. 377\n, 61 S.Ct. 291, decided December 16, 1940.\n The motive and purpose of the present regulation are plainly to make effective the Congressional conception of public policy that interstate commerce should not be made the instrument of competition in the distribution of goods produced under substandard labor conditions, which competition is injurious to the commerce and to the states from and to which the commerce flows. The motive and purpose of a regulation of interstate commerce are matters for the legislative judgment upon the exercise of which the Constitution places no restriction and over which the courts are given no control. McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; Sonzinsky v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 506, 513\n, 57 S.Ct. 554, 555, and cases cited. 'The judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative departments of the government limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged power'. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 548. Whatever their motive and purpose, regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibition are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause. Subject only to that limitation, presently to be considered, we conclude that the prohibition of the shipment interstate of goods produced under the forbidden substandard labor conditions is within the constitutional authority of Congress.\n In the more than a century which has elapsed since the decision of Gibbons v. Ogden, these principles of constitutional interpretation have been so long and repeatedly recognized by this Court as applicable to the Commerce Clause, that there would be little occasion for repeating them now were it not for the decision of this Court twenty-two years ago in Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S.Ct. 529, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724. In that case it was held by a bare majority of the Court over the powerful and now classic dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes setting forth the fundamental issues involved, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 116]\n\u00a0\n that Congress was without power to exclude the products of child labor from interstate commerce. The reasoning and conclusion of the Court's opinion there cannot be reconciled with the conclusion which we have reached, that the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause is plenary to exclude any article from interstate commerce subject only to the specific prohibitions of the Constitution.\n Hammer v. Dagenhart has not been followed. The distinction on which the decision was rested that Congressional power to prohibit interstate commerce is limited to articles which in themselves have some harmful or deleterious property-a distinction which was novel when made and unsupported by any provision of the Constitution-has long since been abandoned. Brooks v. United States, supra; Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra; Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Commission, \n303 \nU.S. 419\n, 58 S.Ct. 678, 115 A.L.R. 105; Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648. The thesis of the opinion that the motive of the prohibition or its effect to control in some measure the use or production within the states of the article thus excluded from the commerce can operate to deprive the regulation of its constitutional authority has long since ceased to have force. Reid v. Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, supra; Seven Cases v. United States, supra, \n239 \nU.S. 514\n, 36 S.Ct. 191; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., supra, \n251 \nU.S. 156\n, 40 S.Ct. 108; United States v. Carolene Products Co., supra, \n304 \nU.S. 147\n, 58 S.Ct. 780. And finally we have declared 'The authority of the Federal Government over interstate commerce does not differ in extent or character from that retained by the states over intrastate commerce'. United States v. Rock Royal Co-Operative, Inc., \n307 \nU.S. 533, 569\n, 59 S.Ct. 993, 1011.\n The conclusion is inescapable that Hammer v. Dagenhart, was a departure from the principles which have prevailed in the interpretation of the commerce clause both \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 117]\n\u00a0\n before and since the decision and that such vitality, as a precedent, as it then had has long since been exhausted. It should be and now is overruled.\n Validity of the wage and hour requirements. Section 15(a)(2) and  6 and 7 require employers to conform to the wage and hour provisions with respect to all employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce. As appellee's employees are not alleged to be 'engaged in interstate commerce' the validity of the prohibition turns on the question whether the employment, under other than the prescribed labor standards, of employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce is so related to the commerce and so affects it as to be within the reach of the power of Congress to regulate it.\n To answer this question we must at the outset determine whether the particular acts charged in the counts which are laid under  15(a)(2) as they were construed below, constitute 'production for commerce' within the meaning of the statute. As the Government seeks to apply the statute in the indictment, and as the court below construed the phrase 'produced for interstate commerce', it embraces at least the case where an employer engaged, as are appellees, in the manufacture and shipment of goods in filling orders of extrastate customers, manufactures his product with the intent or expectation that according to the normal course of his business all or some part of it will be selected for shipment to those customers.\n Without attempting to define the precise limits of the phrase, we think the acts alleged in the indictment are within the sweep of the statute. The obvious purpose of the Act was not only to prevent the interstate transportation of the proscribed product, but to stop the initial step toward transportation, production with the purpose of so transporting it. Congress was not unaware that \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 118]\n\u00a0\n most manufacturing businesses shipping their product in interstate commerce make it in their shops without reference to its ultimate destination and then after manufacture select some of it for shipment interstate and some intrastate according to the daily demands of their business, and that it would be practically impossible, without disrupting manufacturing businesses, to restrict the prohibited kind of production to the particular pieces of lumber, cloth, furniture or the like which later move in interstate rather than intrastate commerce. Cf. United States v. New York Central R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 457, 464\n, 47 S.Ct. 130, 132.\n The recognized need of drafting a workable statute and the well known circumstances in which it was to be applied are persuasive of the conclusion, which the legislative history supports, S.Rept.No. 884 75th Cong.1st Sess., pp. 7 and 8; H.Rept.No. 2738, 75th Cong.3d Sess., p. 17, that the 'production for commerce' intended includes at least production of goods, which, at the time of production, the employer, according to the normal course of his business, intends or expects to move in interstate commerce although, through the exigencies of the business, all of the goods may not thereafter actually enter interstate commerce. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n There remains the question whether such restriction on the production of goods for commerce is a permissible exercise of the commerce power. The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. See McCul- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 119]\n\u00a0\n loch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. Cf. United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S.Ct. 445.\n While this Court has many times found state regulation of interstate commerce, when uniformity of its regulation is of national concern, to be incompatible with the Commerce Clause even though Congress has not legislated on the subject, the Court has never implied such restraint on state control over matters intrastate not deemed to be regulations of interstate commerce or its instrumentalities even though they affect the commerce. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 398\n, 410 S. et seq., 33 S.Ct. 729, 739, 744, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18, and cases cited. In the absence of Congressional legislation on the subject state laws which are not regulations of the commerce itself or its instrumentalities are not forbidden even though they affect interstate commerce. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1\n, 9 S.Ct. 6; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S.Ct. 299; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S.Ct. 83; Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S.Ct. 526.\n But it does not follow that Congress may not by appropriate legislation regulate intrastate activities where they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n303 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 58 S.Ct. 656, 660. A recent example is the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A .  151 et seq., for the regulation of employer and employee relations in industries in which strikes, induced by unfair labor practices named in the Act, tend to disturb or obstruct interstate commerce. See National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 40 S., 57 S.Ct. 615, 625, 108 A.L.R. 1352; National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601, 604\n, 59 S.Ct. 668, 670, and cases cited. But long before the adoption of the National Labor Relations Act, this Court had many times held that the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce extends to the regulation through legislative action of activities in- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 120]\n\u00a0\n trastate which have a substantial effect on the commerce or the exercise of the Congressional power over it. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In such legislation Congress has sometimes left it to the courts to determine whether the intrastate activities have the prohibited effect on the commerce, as in the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note. It has sometimes left it to an administrative board or agency to determine whether the activities sought to be regulated or prohibited have such effect, as in the case of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and the National Labor Relations Act or whether they come within the statutory definition of the prohibited Act as in the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  41 et seq. And sometimes Congress itself has said that a particular activity affects the commerce as it did in the present act, the Safety Appliance Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq. In passing on the validity of legislation of the class last mentioned the only function of courts is to determine whether the particular activity regulated or prohibited is within the reach \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 121]\n\u00a0\n of the federal power. See United States v. Ferger, supra; Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 553\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 602.\n Congress, having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities. Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government. See Ruppert, Inc., v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264\n, 40 S.Ct. 141; Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545, 560\n, 44 S.Ct. 628, 631; Westfall v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 256, 259\n, 47 S.Ct. 629. As to state power under the Fourteenth Amendment, compare Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 609\n, 23 S.Ct. 168; St. John v. New York, \n201 \nU.S. 633\n, 26 S.Ct. 554, 5 Ann.Cas. 909; Purity Extract & Tonic Company v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 201\n, 202 S., 33 S.Ct. 44, 45, 46. A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled. Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Wisconsin Railroad Comm. v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; United States v. New York Central R.R. Co., supra, \n272 \nU.S. 464\n, 47 S.Ct. 132; Currin v. Wallace, \n306 \nU.S. 1\n, 59 S.Ct. 379; Mulford v. Smith, supra. Similarly Congress may require inspection and preventive treatment of all cattle in a disease infected area in order to prevent shipment in interstate commerce of some of the cattle without the treatment. Thornton v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 414\n, 46 S.Ct. 585. It may prohibit the removal, at destination, of labels required by the Pure Food & Drugs Act, 21 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., to be affixed to ar- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 122]\n\u00a0\n ticles transported in interstate commerce. McDermott v. wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115\n, 33 S.Ct. 431, 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 984, Ann.Cas.1915A, 39. And we have recently held that Congress in the exercise of its power to require inspection and grading of tobacco shipped in interstate commerce may compel such inspection and grading of all tobacco sold at local auction rooms from which a substantial part but not all of the tobacco sold is shipped in interstate commerce. Currin v. Wallace, supra, \n306 \nU.S. 11\n, 59 S.Ct. 385, and see to the like effect United States v. Rock Royal Co-Op., supra, \n307 \nU.S. 568\n, 59 S.Ct. 1010, note 37.\n We think also that  15[a]\n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 2]\n\u00a0\n, now under consideration, is sustainable independently of  15(a)(1), which prohibits shipment or transportation of the proscribed goods. As we have said the evils aimed at by the Act are the spread of substandard labor conditions through the use of the facilities of interstate commerce for competition by the goods so produced with those produced under the prescribed or better labor conditions; and the consequent dislocation of the commerce itself caused by the impairment or destruction of local businesses by competition made effective through interstate commerce. The Act is thus directed at the suppression of a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as 'unfair', as the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, has condemned other 'unfair methods of competition' made effective through interstate commerce. See Van Camp & Sons v. American Can Co., \n278 \nU.S. 245\n, 49 S.Ct. 112, 60 A.L.R. 1060; Federal Trade Comm. v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., \n291 \nU.S. 304\n, 54 S.Ct. 423.\n The Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act are familiar examples of the exertion of the commerce power to prohibit or control activities wholly intrastate because of their effect on interstate commerce. See as to the Sherman Act, Northern Securities Company v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197\n, 24 S.Ct. 436; Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276; United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762; Local \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 123]\n\u00a0\n 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n, 54 S.Ct. 396; Stevens Co. et al. v. Foster & Kleiser Co. et al., \n311 \nU.S. 255\n, 61 S.Ct. 210, decided December 9, 1940. As to the National Labor Relations Act, see National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, and cases cited.\n The means adopted by  15(a)(2) for the protection of interstate commerce by the suppression of the production of the condemned goods for interstate commerce is so related to the commerce and so affects it as to be within the reach of the commerce power. See Currin v. Wallace, supra, \n306 \nU.S. 11\n, 59 S.Ct. 385. Congress, to attain its objective in the suppression of nationwide competition in interstate commerce by goods produced under substandard labor conditions, has made no distinction as to the volume or amount of shipments in the commerce or of production for commerce by any particular shipper or producer. It recognized that in present day industry, competition by a small part may affect the whole and that the total effect of the competition of many small producers may be great. See H. Rept. No. 2182, 75th Cong. 1st Sess., p. 7. The legislation aimed at a whole embraces all its parts. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, \n306 \nU.S. 606\n, 59 S.Ct. 671.\n So far as Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, is inconsistent with this conclusion, its doctrine is limited in principle by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act, which we have cited and which we follow. See, also, Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907; Currin v. Wallace, supra; Mulford v. Smith, supra; United States v. Rock Royal Co-Op., supra; Clover Fork Coal Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 6 Cir., 97 F.2d 331; National Labor Relations Board v. Crowe Coal Co., 8 Cir., 104 F.2d 633; National Labor Relations Board v. Good Coal Co., 6 Cir., 110 F.2d 501.\n Our conclusion is unaffected by the Tenth Amendment which provides: 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 124]\n\u00a0\n States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people'. The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers. See e.g., II Elliot's Debates, 123, 131; III id. 450, 464, 600; IV id. 140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767-768; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution, secs. 1907, 1908.\n From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end. Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324, 325; McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 4 Wheat. 405, 406; Gordon v. United States, 117 U.S. Appendix, 697, 705; Lottery Case, supra; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, supra, \n193 \nU.S. 344, 345\n, 24 S.Ct. 459, 460; Everard's Breweries v. Day, supra, \n265 \nU.S. 558\n, 44 S.Ct. 631; United States v. Sprague, \n282 \nU.S. 716, 733\n, 51 S.Ct. 220, 222, 71 A.L.R. 1381; see United States v. The Brigantine William, 28 Fed.Cas. 614, 622, No. 16,700. Whatever doubts may have arisen of the soundness of that conclusion they have been put at rest by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act which we have cited. See, also, Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 330\n, 331 S., 56 S.Ct. 466, 475; Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., \n304 \nU.S. 502, 516\n, 58 S.Ct. 1025, 1033.\n Validity of the requirement of records of wages and hours.  15(a)(5) and  11(c). These requirements are incidental to those for the prescribed wages and \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 125]\n\u00a0\n hours, and hence validity of the former turns on validity of the latter. Since, as we have held, Congress may require production for interstate Commerce to conform to those conditions, it may require the employer, as a means of enforcing the valid law, to keep a record showing whether he has in fact complied with it. The requirement for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end. See Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612\n, 31 S.Ct. 621; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S.Ct. 436; Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 43 S.Ct. 470, 479.\n Validity of the wage and hour provisions under the Fifth Amendment. Both provisions are minimum wage requirements compelling the payment of a minimum standard wage with a prescribed increased wage for overtime of 'not less than one and one-half times the regular rate' at which the worker is employed. Since our decision in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330, it is no longer open to question that the fixing of a minimum wage is within the legislative power and that the bare fact of its exercise is not a denial of due process under the Fifth more than under the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor is it any longer open to question that it is within the legislative power to fix maximum hours. Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366\n, 18 S.Ct. 383; Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412\n, 28 S.Ct. 324, 13 Ann.Cas. 957; Bunting v. Oregon, infra; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra. Similarly the statute is not objectionable because applied alike to both men and women. Cf. Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 \nU.S. 426\n, 37 S.Ct. 435, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1043.\n The Act is sufficiently definite to meet constitutional demands. One who employs persons, without conforming to the prescribed wage and hour conditions, to work on goods which he ships or expects to ship across state \n\n[312 \nU.S. 100, 126]\n\u00a0\n lines, is warned that he may be subject to the criminal penalties of the Act. No more is required. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Ct. 780, 781.\n We have considered, but find it unnecessary to discuss other contentions.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 2 ( 202). (a) The Congress hereby finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce.'\n Section 3(b) defines 'commerce' as 'trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or from any State to any place outside thereof.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

EMORY(1941)\nNo. 33\nArgued: November 10, 1941Decided: December 15, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 424]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Melvin H. Siegel, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n No appearance for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the application of  3466 of the Revised Statutes, 31 U.S.C.A.  191, to a claim of the United States under the National Housing Act in an equity receivership proceeding in a state court.\n The St. James Distillery, a corporation, executed a note to the Industrial Bank and Trust Company of St. Louis on September 23, 1935. On July 14, 1936 the Bank endorsed the note and delivered it to the Federal Housing Administration, acting on behalf of the United States, under a contract of insurance and guaranty provided for in Title I of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C.A.  1701 et seq. The United States, through the Federal Housing Administration, on that date reimbursed the Bank in the amount of $5988.88, the balance due on the note. Emory, claiming wages due him, filed a petition on August 27, 1936 in the Circuit Court of Phelps County, Missouri, alleging that the St. James Distillery was hopelessly insolvent and praying that a receiver be appointed. On September 9 the Circuit Court found all the issues in Emory's favor and appointed a receiver who took possession of the corporate assets.\n After deductions for the costs of the receivership, the assets available for distribution totaled $678. Against this amount the wage claims of 'about twelve individuals' were filed. The separate amounts of these claims were neither stipulated nor determined by the courts below; their aggregate was 'about $900'. The United States, on behalf of the Federal Housing Administration, filed a claim for the $5988.88 due on the note. The wage claim- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 425]\n\u00a0\n ants asserted priority under  1168 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri; 1 the United States asserted priority under  3466 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Phelps County decided that the claim of the United States should be treated as an ordinary claim against the estate, and that the wage claims should be paid first. On appeal, the Springfield Court of Appeals held that the claim of the United States on behalf of the Federal Housing Administration was accorded preference over ordinary claims by  3466 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Consequently, it was of the opinion that the Circuit Court had erred in treating the claim of the United States as an ordinary claim. However, it held further that the error was of no consequence, since the Missouri statute granted priority to wage claims even over other preferred claims and no assets would remain after they had been satisfied. Rehearing was denied, and \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 426]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court of Missouri denied a petition for certiorari. We granted certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S.Ct. 836, because of the importance of the question and because of an asserted conflict of decisions.\n The applicability of  3466 to this case is clear. The section applies in terms to cases '(1) in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or (2) in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, ... (or) (3) in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.' This case falls within the third category. It is agreed that the St. James Distillery was insolvent 'on or before August 1936' and that in response to a creditor's petition a receiver was appointed to liquidate the corporate assets. The appointment of a receiver under such circumstances is among the most common examples of an 'act of bankruptcy'. Cf.  3, sub. a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, U.S.C., Title 11,  21(a)(4), 11 U.S.C.A.  21, sub. a(4).\n Just such proceedings as this, therefore, are governed by the plain command of  3466 that 'debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.' The purpose of this section is 'to secure an adequate public revenue to sustain the public burden' (United States v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, 35), and it is to be construed liberally in order to effectuate that purpose. Bramwell v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n269 \nU.S. 483, 487\n, 46 S.Ct. 176. In view of this language, purpose, and rule of construction, the priority asserted here by the United States appears to be securely established.\n The court below, however, held otherwise. In granting priority to the wage claims over that of the United States, it relied upon Missouri law. It recognized, as the authorities obliged it to recognize,3 that the state statute could \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n not prevail if it was in conflict with  3466. But it decided that no such conflict arose, for the reason that  3466 had been impliedly modified by  64, sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act,4 which, like the Missouri statute, requires that wage claims be satisfied before those of the United States.\n The judgment below must have rested upon either of the following theories: that Congress intended by  64, sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act to subordinate claims of the United States to wage claims in non-bankruptcy proceedings generally; or that Congress intended by  64, sub. a to modify  3466 only so far as to grant priority over the United States to wage claimants in state non-bankruptcy proceedings when they would be entitled to such priority by otherwise applicable state law.\n There is a difficulty common to both theories which we regard as insurmountable. Neither the language of  64, sub. a nor the Congressional history of the legislation here involved supports the proposition that  64, sub. a was intended to eliminate, either partially or wholly, the priority of claims of the United States in non-bankruptcy proceedings. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 428]\n\u00a0\n The provisions of  3466 have been in force since 1797, without significant modification. 1 Stat. 515. The first three federal bankruptcy acts5 specifically preserved the priority of the United States over all other claimants in bankruptcy proceedings in the federal courts. Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898,6 however, disturbed this state of affairs. It provided an order of distribution of the assets of bankrupt estates in which certain wage claims preceded non-tax claims of the United States. While  64 has been altered since 1898 in several particulars, the priority of wage claims over non-tax claims of the United States has continued. Consequently, we must look to the Act of 1898 for evidence that the priority accorded to wage claims by  64 was intended to apply to more than bankruptcy proceedings in the more than bankruptcy proceedings in the\n We find no such evidence. The entire Act of 1898, as  2, 11 U.S.C.A .  11, in particular plainly reveals, was designed to create federal courts of bankruptcy and to define their functions. Indeed,  64 itself, in subdivision a, refers to the 'court';  1, 11 U.S.C.A.  1, provides that, as used in the Act, 'court' means 'the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 429]\n\u00a0\n court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending'; and  1 also provides that 'courts of bankruptcy', as used in the Act, mean the federal district courts and a few other federal courts. There is no internal sign that any part of  64 was intended to apply to state courts or to non- bankruptcy proceedings in the federal courts. We have looked in vain in the committee reports and the debate upon the bill for any external hint of such an intention.\n It is not strange, therefore, that both courts and commentators have assumed that the application of  64 of the Act of 1898 was limited to federal bankruptcy proceedings, and that the priority of claims of the United States in non-bankruptcy proceedings remained unaffected.

See Rogge, The Differences in Priority of the United States in Bankruptcy and in Equity Receiverships, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 251; Blair, The Priority of the United States in Equity Receiverships, 39 Harv.L.Rev. 1. We are aware of but a single case in which an appellate court has specifically passed upon the contention that the priority granted to the United States in non- bankruptcy proceedings by  3466 has been modified by  64 of the Bankruptcy Act. And in that case, the contention was rejected. Matter of Kupshire Coats, Inc., v. United States, 272 N.Y. 221, 5 N.E.2d 715.7\n While the point was not discussed in the courts below, it is now urged that the objectives and provisions of the National Housing Act require us to hold that claims of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 430]\n\u00a0\n United States arising under it are not entitled to the priority awarded by  3466. We are aware of no canon of statutory construction compelling us to hold that the word 'first' in a 150 year old statute means 'second' or 'third', unless Congress later has said so or implied it unmistakably.\n Certainly there is no provision in the National Housing Act expressly relinquishing the priority of the United States with respect to claims arising under it. At best, therefore, such an intention on the part of Congress must be found in some patent inconsistency between the purposes of the Housing Act and  3466. The plain objective of the Housing Act was to stimulate the building trades and to increase employment. In order to induce banks and other lending institutions to get the program under way, Congress promised that the United States would make good up to 20% on the losses they might incur on such loans. 8 As between the government and the lending institutions, it was clearly intended that the United States should bear the losses resulting from defaults. But beyond this we may not go. There is nothing to show a further intention that the United States should relinquish its priority as to claims against defaulting and insolvent borrowers whose notes it takes up from the lending institution pursuant to the insurance contract. That is, the ultimate collection of bad loans was consigned to the United States rather than to the lending institutions, but the collecting power of the United States was neither abridged nor qualified. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n We are told, however, that the broad purposes of the Act would be thwarted if we failed to assume that Con- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 431]\n\u00a0\n gress intended to surrender this priority. The reason advanced is that suppliers of goods and services would refuse to extend credit to those desiring to make property improvements if they knew that in the event of insolvency their claims would be subordinated to those of the United States. The fatal weakness of this contention is that the Federal Housing Administration imposes an ironclad requirement that the proceeds of insured loans be used for no purpose other than the improvements described in the application for the loan. \n10\n Indeed, lending institutions frequently pay the proceeds of the loan directly to the suppliers of goods and services rather than to the property owner, and the practice has met with the enthusiastic approval of the Administration. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Consequently, the argument against the application of  3466 is reduced to this: Private persons in general are reluctant to extend credit when they know that in the event of the borrower's insolvency the claims of the United States will receive priority, and this circumstance is particularly undesirable in times of economic stress. In the first place, whatever may be the merits of the contention, it should be addressed to Congress and not to this Court. In the second place, the argument proves too much. If it is sound as applied to this kind of a claim of the United States, it is equally sound as applied to all claims as to which the United States asserts priority under  3466\n\n\n Neither Cook County National Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445\n, 2 S. Ct. 561, nor United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 432]\n\u00a0\n \n280 \nU.S. 478\n, 50 S.Ct. 212, requires a different conclusion. In the former case, the United States was denied its  3466 priority in connection with a claim against a national bank for the amount of certain funds of the United States deposited with it. The decision was based on two grounds. First, the national banking Act undertook to provide a complete system for the establishment and government of banks, and it included specific provisions concerning the distribution of the assets of insolvent banks which were plainly inconsistent with the granting of priority to general claims of the United States. Second, the national banking Act expressly authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to require national banks accepting deposits of federal funds to give satisfactory security; it was held to be fairly inferable that Congress intended the United States to look to this provision rather than to  3466 for protection.\n The claims which were denied priority in the Guaranty Trust case arose under Title II of the Transportation Act of 1920, 49 U.S.C.A.  72 et seq., 141. That Act provided for the funding of debts to the United States which the railroads had contracted during the period of wartime control, and also provided for new loans to the railroads. In holding  3466 inapplicable to the collection of these loans the Court emphasized that he basic purpose of the Act was to promote the general credit status of the railroads, that the railroads were required to furnish adequate security for the payment of both the old and new loans, and that the interest rate of 6% on one class of loans was 'much greater than that which ordinarily accompanies even a business loan carrying such assurance of repayment as would have resulted from an application of the priority rule.' 280 U.S. at page 486, 50 S.Ct. at page 214. These factors persuaded the Court that Congress had intended to exclude these loans from the scope of  3466.\n In the instant case none of these circumstances is present. The National Housing Act contains no refer- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 433]\n\u00a0\n ence to the liquidation of estates of insolvent borrowers, and consequently no direct inconsistency with  3466 is possible. The purpose of Title I was not the strengthening of the general credit of property owners, but the stimulation of the building trades by affording assurances to lending institutions in order to induce them to make loans for property improvements. No security was required of the borrowers, and the interest charge was low. \n12\n Only the plainest inconsistency would warrant our finding an implied exception to the operation of so clear a command as that of  3466. We think such inconsistency is wholly wanting here.\n Section 3466 is applicable to this proceeding, and it requires that the claim of the United States be first satisfied.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED (dissenting).\n The purpose and provisions of the National Housing Act1 lead me to the conclusion that  3466 of the Revised \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 434]\n\u00a0\n Statutes is inapplicable to the claim of the Administrator in this case. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n A statute is not to be interpreted by its text alone, as though it were a specimen under laboratory control. It takes meaning from other enactments forming the whole body of law bearing upon its subject. \n3\n If, like  3466, it has been upon the books for years, the precedents interpreting its meaning must be considered in connection with it, particularly when, as here, new legislation is passed which may be inconsistent with its application. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n From past interpretation we learn that the traditional function of  3466 is the assurance of the public revenue,5 whatever may be the expense to the competing creditors. Their interests are subordinated to the general advantage. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 435]\n\u00a0\n Title I of the National Housing Act, however, is not a revenue measure-it was intended to stimulate recovery and employment in the construction industries and to enable property-owners to obtain funds for sorely needed repairs by insuring financial institutions against loss on loans for such work. \n7\n This was accomplished by what is in effect a guarantee that all losses on rehabilitation loans up to a predetermined percentage (20% here) of the total made by the financial institution would be borne by the United States, either by taking over loans in default or paying the deficit. \n8\n That loss Congress intended the government to bear. \n9\n In estimating the loss it relied upon the experience of private companies which were unaided by any such priority as  3466.10 Loans could \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 436]\n\u00a0\n not be made for a longer term than five years and many would be for less. Stable economic improvement was hardly to be expected within that time, and yet many of those who borrowed would die, or default, and undergo some sort of financial liquidation. The enforcement of  3466 under those circumstances would shift the loss from the government to competing creditors, thus hampering the efforts of private business and capital to achieve that economic recovery which was the aim of the legislation. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Nothing in the hearings, the debates or the Act show definitively that Congress considered the application of  3466 to government claims under the National Housing Act. If the two acts alone were to be appraised, it might well be concluded that as they are not necessarily inconsistent, both should be enforced. But the determination of Congressional purpose is not so simple as that. Upon the assumption that the applicability of  3466 never came to the attention of Congress, we must find legislative purpose not from the language of the two Acts alone but from generalizations as to the object of the new statute and from judicial interpretations of the meaning of the old. To reach a sound conclusion as to the applicability of the priority statute and the purpose of Congress deduced merely from the state of the law at the time of the enactment of the Housing Act, we need to weigh the precedents under  3466 quite as carefully as the Acts themselves, in order to develop the legal situation \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 437]\n\u00a0\n into which the Housing Act was injected. When this is done, it is apparent that each time this Court has considered legislative purpose as to  3466 in relation to government claims under public financial legislation affecting creditors competing with the Government, it has determined  3466 did not apply. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The National Housing Act was 'one of the latest of a series of enactments, extending over more than a century, through which the Federal Government has recognized and fulfilled its obligation to provide a national system of financial institutions ....'13 Section 3466 is inconsistent with this purpose. \n14\n It is not significant that in the case of Cook County National Bank the debtor bank against which priority was denied was in the federal financial system, while here the debtor is a private corporation which has participated in a federal financing plan. The intrusion of a novel priority, uncertain in amount because unrecorded, into the intricate credit system of the nation at a time of strain, would be a drag on recovery rather than a stimulus. Suppliers of goods or services in all fields of credit activity would be moved to constrict their advances to a borrower known to have created a secret but valid lien upon his assets superior to all general creditors. The full reach of the implication of credit dislocation may be readily gauged by the fact that at the end of 1936, 1,326,102 separate rehabilitation loans had been made under Title I for an aggregate amount of.$500,220,642.15 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 438]\n\u00a0\n Possible priorities will now exist for every outstanding dollar.\n The facts of this case show how government aid to a debtor may be a snare for his other creditors if the priority statute operates in this class of claims. About a dozen claimants became creditors in the aggregate amount of some nine hundred dollars for labor. Such labor claims were entitled to the preference under Missouri law common to labor claims. But for the priority of the government's claim, they would receive all of the realization from the assets-about two-thirds of their claims. But a month before the appointment of the receiver the Federal Housing Administration took over from a bank a note of about $6000. From a deferred position in the hands of the bank this debt is said to have stepped into a preferred position by transfer to the government agency. As such it absorbs all of the assets, and the laborers who trusted their employer's credit get nothing. Such a preference of creditors, brought about by the debtor, would be an act of bankruptcy.\n In 1920 when the railroads needed funds but lacked credit for private borrowing, government loans were authorized by Congress based upon such prospective earning power and security as would furnish reasonable assurance of repayment. \n16\n In United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n280 \nU.S. 478\n, 50 S.Ct. 212, we held that the rehabilitating functions and the security provisions of the Transportation Act of 1920 were so inconsistent with  3466 as to preclude its application in the receivership of a debtor railroad. Even more inconsistent considerations exist in this case. Congress was confronted with widespread need of repairs on property owned by persons without the cash or credit to secure them. \n17\n Moreover, not only homeowners \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 439]\n\u00a0\n but, like the railroads, hard pressed business establishments such as the distillery in this case were to be assisted in securing modernization loans. \n18\n Instead of lending these people federal funds, Congress lent them federal credit on which to borrow private funds, with the evident purpose of keeping the program as much as possible a matter of private enterprise handled in the course of private affairs. Assurance of repayment was rested not on a combination of security and earning power but deliberately upon earning power alone. \n19\n Whereas with the railroads interest corresponding to the risk was charged, no premium was charged for the insurance of loans under Title I, with the expectation that the government would pay the loss as its contribution to recovery. \n20\n The declared purpose of the United States to absorb the losses of the lenders is clearly inconsistent with the priority over other creditors given by  3466. It seems beyond doubt to me that Congress did not expect a priority under Title I which the Guaranty Trust case certainly denied it under Title II relating to insured mortgages. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Even in the mechanics of its operation Title I repudiated the benefits of  3466. Collection was left to the financial institution after default so long as there was \n\n[314 \nU.S. 423, 440]\n\u00a0\n hope of partial liquidation. \n22\n The lender, of course, had no priority.\n The judgment should be affirmed on the ground that no priority exists by virtue of  3466.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mo.Rev.Stat.(1929)  1168, Rev.St.1939,  1332, so far as pertinent, provides: 'Hereafter when the property of any company, corporation, firm or persons shall be seized upon by any process of any court of this state, or when their business shall be ... put into the hands of a receiver or trustee, then in all such cases the debts owing to laborers or servants, which have accrued by reason of their labor or employment, to an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars to each employee, for work or labor performed within six months next preceding the seizure or transfer of such property, shall be ... first paid in full; and if there be not sufficient to pay them in full, then the same shall be paid to them pro rata, after paying costs.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S.Rev.Stat.  3466, U.S.C., Title, 31, Section 191, 31 U.S.C.A.  191, provides: 'Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Field v.

The income from these premiums was to be used primarily to meet operating expenses under Title I and secondarily to meet losses resulting from defaults. In his report dated April 1, 1941, the Administrator estimated that for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1941 this income from premiums would prove sufficient to reimburse the United States for less than half its losses under Title I, and that $4,000,000 of public funds would be required to meet the balance.

It is only after it clearly appears that further collection efforts will be fruitless that the Federal Housing Administration will insist that claims be made. Financial institutions are, therefore, given a full year after default on the note to effect collection. ... If 10% of the amount due on the note is collected within the first year after default on the note and so long thereafter as 5% at least is collected in each six-month period, the Federal Housing Administration will not require that claim be made, but will permit the financial institution to proceed with its collection efforts. Claims may include: (1) Net unpaid principal; (2) uncollected earned interest (after maturity interest is not to be claimed at a rate exceeding 6% per annum); ( 3) uncollected 'late charges'; (4) uncollected court costs, including fees paid for issuing, serving, and filing summons; (5) attorney's fees not exceeding 15% of the amount collected on the defaulted note; (6) handling fee of $5 for each note, if judgment is secured, plus 5% of amount collected subsequent to return of unsatisfied property execution.' \n\n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Gen., and Herbert Wechsler, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. F. W. Fischer, of Tyler, Tex., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The District Court sustained a demurrer to ten counts of an indictment and the Government appeals. 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682.\n There were eleven counts in the indictment, the first of which, a conspiracy count, the District Court found good. The other counts now before us were based on Section 35 of the Criminal Code. 18 U.S.C.  80, 18 U.S.C.A.  80. 1 Eight of these counts charged in substance that defendants had willfully caused to be made and used verified reports falsely and fraudulently stating the amount of petroleum produced from certain oil wells, and the other two counts made a similar charge with respect to verified reports as to the amount of petroleum received from certain producers.\n The District Court held that these substantive counts did not state an offense under Section 35 of the Criminal Code as amended by the Act of June 18, 1934. 48 Stat. 996. The court plainly rested its decision upon its construction of the statute and hence direct appeal to this Court is properly brought. We are concerned only with the correctness of this construction and not with the mere interpretation of the indictment as a pleading. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 142, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325; United States v. Birdsall, \n233 \nU.S. 223, 230\n, 34 S.Ct. 512, 514; United States v. Kapp, \n302 \nU.S. 214, 217\n, 58 S.Ct. 182, 184; United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 195\n, 60 S.Ct. 182, 186.\n Section 35, as amended, makes it a crime knowingly and willfully to 'make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations', or to 'make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement of entry in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States'. The reports containing the alleged false and fraudulent statements in this instance were charged to have related 'to a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Federal Tender Board No. 1, Kilgore, Texas'.\n By the Act of February 22, 1935, 49 Stat. 30, 31,2 the so-called 'Hot Oil' Act, the transportation in interstate commerce from any State of 'contraband oil' produced therein was prohibited, such oil being that 'produced, transported, or withdrawn from storage' in excess of the amounts permitted under the laws of the State or regulations duly made by its agencies. The President was authorized to prescribe regulations for the enforcement of the Act, including the requirement of 'reports, maps, affidavits, and other documents relating to the production, storage, refining, processing, transporting, or handling of petroleum and petroleum products'. Under this authority the President designated the Secretary of the Interior as his agent, and the latter promulgated regulations which the President approved. There was thus set up Federal Tender Board No. 1, to be located at Kilgore, Texas, for the East Texas Field, and monthly reports on forms approved by the Secretary were required to be filed with the Board. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n If the provision of Section 35, under which the indictment is laid, be construed according to its literal and natural import, it is manifest that the statute covers the offenses \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n charged in the substantive counts. The affidavits and reports, as described in the indictment, containing statements alleged to be false and fraudulent, were made and used in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department and agency of the United States. Nor can the statute be deemed to be invalid because of indefiniteness. The affidavits and reports required had been sufficiently described and the duty enjoined had been adequately defined. Any one presenting the required affidavits and reports to the Board set up under the pertinent regulations was suitably charged with notice of the consequence of knowingly and willfully including therein any false and fraudulent statements.\n Defendant's contention, which the District Court sustained, is that the broad language of the statutory provision here involved should be restricted by construction so as to apply only to matters of a nature similar to those with which other provisions of Section 35 deal, 'such as claims against, rights to, or controversies about funds involved in 'operations of the Government\", that is, to matters in which the Government has some financial or proprietary interest. This contention is sought to be supported by the doctrine of ejusdem generis and the construction given to Section 35 prior to the amendment of 1934, and by reference to the incongruity of the penalty prescribed for violation of Section 35 as contrasted with the penalty prescribed by the Act of February 22, 1935, to the enforcement of which the requirements in question were directed. Defendant also presents the contention, upon which the District Court did not pass, that the Act of February 22, 1935, was intended to cover the entire subject of the exclusion of 'hot oil' from interstate commerce and consequently operated as a repeal of all other provisions dealing with that matter.\n Before, the amendment of 1934, Section 35, after referring to the presentation of claims against the government which were known to be false or fraudulent, provided: \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n 'or whoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or approval of such claim, or for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States, or any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry; ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both'.4\n Distinguishing that provision from Section 37, 18 U.S.C.A.  88, the conspiracy section of the Criminal Code which by its terms extended broadly to every conspiracy 'to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose',5 this Court held that Section 35 which used the word 'defrauding' in connection with 'cheating and swindling' should be construed 'as relating to the fraudulent causing of pecuniary or property loss' to the government. And that meaning was deemed to be emphasized by the context found in other provisions of Section 35. United States v. Cohn, \n270 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 347 S., 46 S.Ct. 251, 253.\n The Act of June 18, 1934,6 amended Section 35 so that in place of the portion quoted above there were substituted these words: 'or whoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 93]\n\u00a0\n fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or of any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder; ... shall be fined' etc.\n The amendment eliminated the words 'cheating and swindling' and broadened the provision so as to leave no adequate basis for the limited construction which had previously obtained. The statute was made to embrace false and fraudulent statements or representations where these were knowingly and willfully used in documents or affidavits 'in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States'. In this, there was no restriction to cases involving pecuniary or property loss to the government. The amendment indicated the congressional intent to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result from the deceptive practices described. We see no reason why this apparent intention should be frustrated by construction.\n The rule of ejusdem generis is a familiar and useful one in interpreting words by the association in which they are found, but it gives no warrant for narrowing alternative provisions which the legislature has adopted with the purpose of affording added safeguards. 'The rule of 'ejusdem generis' is applied as an aid in ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, not to subvert it when ascertained'. Texas v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 522, 534\n, 54 S.Ct. 819, 825\n\n\n If the language of the amended section could be deemed ambiguous the legislative history of the amendment would dispel any doubt as to the congressional purpose. Legislation had been sought by the Secretary \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 94]\n\u00a0\n of the Interior to aid the enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforcement of regulations under Section 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 19337 with respect to the transportation of 'hot oil'. The Secretary's effort was due, as he stated, to the lack of a law under which prosecutions might be had 'for the presentation of false papers'.8 The bill which was passed by Congress, however, was amended in its final stages so as to require 'intent to defraud the United States'.9 This bill was returned by the President without his approval for the reason that the offense as defined was covered by existing law which provided for more severe punishment than that proposed by the bill. \n10\n Another measure was then proposed by the Secretary of the Interior which would obviate these objections and accomplish the purpose of reaching the presentation of false papers in relation to 'hot oil'. A bill was then passed and approved which included, with other amendments of Section 35, the provision now before us, omitting the limiting words which had been deemed to make the former provision applicable only to cases where pecuniary or property loss to the government had been caused. \n11\n The report of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate stated that the amendment in question had been proposed by the Department of the Interior with the purpose 'of reaching a large number of cases involving the shipment of 'hot' \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 95]\n\u00a0\n oil where false papers are presented in connection therewith'.12\n The fact that the Secretary of the Interior was then seeking aid in the enforcement of Section 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act which this Court later found to be invalid (Panama Refining Company v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n, 55 S.Ct. 241), in no way affects the present application of the statute. Its provisions were not limited to the enforcement of Section 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act but were enacted with appropriate breadth so that they at once applied to the presentation of affidavits, reports, etc., required by the subsequent Act of February 22, 1935, and the regulations duly prescribed thereunder.\n In the light of the text of the Act of 1934, amending Section 35, and its legislative history, it is also clear that the fact that the penalty prescribed by Section 35 was greater than that fixed by the Act of February 22, 1935, has no significance in connection with the construction and application of the former. The matter of penalties lay within the discretion of Congress. Section 35 covered a variety of offenses and the penalties prescribed were maximum penalties which gave a range for judicial sentences according to the circumstances and gravity of particular violations.\n Similarly lacking in merit is the contention that the Act of February 22, 1935, operated to repeal Section 35 as amended in 1934, so far as the latter applied to affidavits, documents, etc., presented in relation to 'hot oil'. There was no express repeal and there was no repugnancy in the subject matter of the two statutes which would justify an implication of repeal. The Act of 1934 with its provision as to false and fraudulent papers, has its place as a fitting complement to the Act of 1935 as well as to other statutes under which, in connection with the au- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 86, 96]\n\u00a0\n thorized action of governmental departments or agencies, the presentation of affidavits, documents, etc., is required. There is no indication of an intent to make the Act of 1935 a substitute for any part of the provision in Section 35. See Posadas v. National City Bank, \n296 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 504 S., 56 S.Ct. 349, 352; United States v. Borden Company, \n308 \nU.S. 188, 198\n, 199 S., 60 S.Ct. 182, 188.\n The judgment sustaining the demurrer to counts 2 to 11, inclusive, is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Act of April 4, 1938, c. 69, 52 Stat. 197, 18 U.S.C.A.  80, 82-86. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 15 U.S.C.  715-715d, 15 U.S.C.A.  715-715d. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Executive Orders No. 6979, issued February 28, 1935, 15 U.S.C.A.  715j note; No. 6980-B, Regulation XIV, approved March 1, 1935; No. 6980-C, approved March 1, 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 40 Stat. 1015. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Haas v.

Tuttle, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Whether the use of conventional, peaceful activities by a union in controversy with a rival union over certain jobs is a violation of the Sherman Law, Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, is the question. It is sharply presented in this case because it arises in a criminal prosecution. Concededly an injunction either at the suit of the Government or of the employer could not issue.\n Summarizing the long indictment, these are the facts. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., operating a large plant in St. Louis, contracted with Borsari Tank Corporation for the erection of an additional facility. The Gaylord Container Corporation, a lessee of adjacent property from Anheuser-Busch, made a similar contract for a new building with the Stocker Company. Anheuser-Busch obtained the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n materials for its brewing and other operations and sold its finished products largely through interstate shipments. The Gaylord Corporation was equally dependent on interstate commerce for marketing its goods, as were the construction companies for their building materials. Among the employees of Anheuser-Busch were members of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America and of the International Association of Machinists. The conflicting claims of these two organizations, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, in regard to the erection and dismantling of machinery had long been a source of controversy between them. Anheuser-Busch had had agreements with both organizations whereby the Machinists were given the disputed jobs and the Carpenters agreed to submit all disputes to arbitration. But in 2939 the president of the Carpenters, their general representative, and two officials of the Carpenters' local organization, the four men under indictment, stood on the claims of the Carpenters for the jobs. Rejection by the employer of the Carpenters' demand and the refusal of the latter to submit to arbitration were followed by a strike of the Carpenters, called by the defendants against Anheuser-Busch and the construction companies, a picketing of Anheuser-Busch and its tenant, and a request through circular letters and the official publication of the Carpenters that union members and their friends refrain from buying Anheuser-Busch beer.\n These activities on behalf of the Carpenters formed the charge of the indictment as a criminal combination and conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Law. Demurrers denying that what was charged constituted a violation of the laws of the United States were sustained (D.C., 32 F.Supp. 600) and the case came here under the Criminal Appeals Act. Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682; Judicial Code  238, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n In order to determine whether an indictment charges an offense against the United States, designation by the pleader of the statute under which he purported to lay the charge is immaterial. He may have conceived the charge under one statute which would not sustain the indictment, but it may nevertheless come within the terms of another statute. See Williams v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 382\n, 18 S.Ct. 92. On the other hand, an indictment may validly satisfy the statute under which the pleader proceeded, but other statutes not referred to by him may draw the sting of criminality from the allegations. Here we must consider not merely the Sherman Law but the related enactments which entered into the decision of the district court.\n Section 1 of the Sherman Law on which the indictment rested is as follows: 'Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.' The controversies engendered by its application to trade union activities and the efforts to secure legislative relief from its consequences are familiar history. The Clayton Act of 1914 was the result. Act of October 15, 1914, 38 Stat. 730. 'This statute was the fruit of unceasing agitation, which extended over more than 20 years and was designed to equalize before the law the position of workingmen and employer as industrial combatants.' Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 484\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 182, 16 A.L.R. 196. Section 20 of that Act, which is set out in the margin in full,1 with- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n drew from the general interdict of the Sherman Law specifically enumerated practices of labor unions by prohibiting injunctions against them-since the use of the injunction had been the major source of dissatisfaction-and also relieved such practices of all illegal taint by the catch-all provision, 'nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States'. The Clayton Act gave rise to new litigation and to renewed controversy in and out of Congress regarding the status of trade unions. By the generality of its terms the Sherman Law had necessarily compelled the courts to work out its meaning from case to case. It was widely believed that into the Clayton Act courts read the very beliefs which that Act was designed to remove. Specifically the courts restricted the scope of  20 to trade union activities directed against an employer by his own employees. Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deer- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 231]\n\u00a0\n ing, supra. Such a view it was urged, both by powerful judicial dissents and informed lay opinion, misconceived the area of economic conflict that had best be left to economic forces and the pressure of public opinion and not subjected to the judgment of courts. Id., 254 U.S. at page 485, 486, 41 S.Ct. at page 183, 16 A.L.R. 196. Agitation again led to legislation and in 1932 Congress wrote the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Act of March 23, 1932, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.  101-115, 29 U.S.C.A.  101-115.\n The Norris-LaGuardia Act removed the fetters upon trade union activities, which according to judicial construction  20 of the Clayton Act had left untouched, by still further narrowing the circumstances under which the federal courts could grant injunctions in labor disputes. More especially, the Act explicitly formulated the 'public policy of the United States' in regard to the industrial conflict,2 and by its light established that the allowable area of union activity was not to be restricted, as it had been in the Duplex case, to an immediate employer- employee relation. Therefore, whether trade union conduct constitutes a violation of the Sherman Law is to be determined only by reading the Sherman Law and  20 of the Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act as a harmonizing text of outlawry of labor conduct. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 232]\n\u00a0\n Were then the acts charged against the defendants prohibited or permitted by these three interlacing statutes? If the facts laid in the indictment come within the conduct enumerated in  20 of the Clayton Act they do not constitute a crime within the general terms of the Sherman Law because of the explicit command of that section that such conduct shall not be 'considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States'. So long as a union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups,3 the licit and the illicit under  20 are not to be distinguished by any judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which the particular union activities are the means. There is nothing remotely within the terms of  20 that differentiates between trade union conduct directed against an employer because of a controversy arising in the relation between employer and employee, as such, and conduct similarly directed but ultimately due to an internecine struggle between two unions seeking the favor of the same employer. Such strife between competing unions has been an obdurate conflict in the evolution of so-called craft unionism and has undoubtedly been one of the potent forces in the modern development of industrial unions. These conflicts have intensified industrial tension but there is not the slightest warrant for saying that Congress has made  20 inapplicable to trade union conduct resulting from them.\n In so far as the Clayton Act is concerned, we must therefore dispose of this case as though we had before us precisely the same conduct on the part of the defendants in pressing claims against Anheuser-Busch for in- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 233]\n\u00a0\n creased wages, or shorter hours, or other elements of what are called working conditions. The fact that what was done was done in a competition for jobs against the Machinists rather than against, let us say, a company union is a differentiation which Congress has not put into the federal legislation and which therefore we cannot write into it.\n It is at once apparent that the acts with which the defendants are charged are the kind of acts protected by  20 of the Clayton Act. The refusal of the Carpenters to work for Anheuser-Busch or on construction work being done for it and its adjoining tenant, and the peaceful attempt to get members of other unions similarly to refuse to work, are plainly within the free scope accorded to workers by  20 for 'terminating any relation of employment', or 'ceasing to perform any work or labor', or 'recommending, advising or persuading others by peaceful means so to do'. The picketing of Anheuser-Busch premises with signs to indicate that Anheuser-Busch was unfair to organized labor, a familiar practice in these situations, comes within the language 'attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working'. Finally, the recommendation to union members and their friends not to buy or use the product of Anheuser- Busch is explicitly covered by 'ceasing to patronize ... any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do'.\n Clearly, then, the facts here charged constitute lawful conduct under the Clayton Act unless the defendants cannot invoke that Act because outsiders to the immediate dispute also shared in the conduct. But we need not determine whether the conduct is legal within the restrictions which Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering gave to the im- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 234]\n\u00a0\n munities of  20 of the Clayton Act. Congress in the Norris-LaGuardia Act has expressed the public policy of the United States and defined its conception of a 'labor dispute' in terms that no longer leave room for doubt. Milk Wagon Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, 61 S.Ct. 122. This was done, as we recently said, in order to 'obviate the results of the judicial construction' theretofore given the Clayton Act. New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Company, \n303 \nU.S. 552, 562\n, 58 S.Ct. 703, 707; see Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469, 507\n, 60 S.Ct. 982, 999, 128 A.L.R. 1044, note 26. Such a dispute,  13(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  113(c), provides, 'includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee'.4 And under  13(b) a person is 'participating or interested in a labor dispute' if he 'is engaged in the same industry, trade, craft, or occupation in which such dispute occurs, or has a direct or indirect interest therein, or is a member, officer, or agent of any association composed in whole or in part of employers or employees engaged in such industry, trade, craft, or occupation'.\n To be sure, Congress expressed this national policy and determined the bounds of a labor dispute in an act explicitly dealing with the further withdrawal of injunctions in labor controversies. But to argue, as it was urged before us, that the Duplex case still governs for purposes of a criminal prosecution is to say that that which on the equity side of the court is allowable conduct may in a criminal proceeding become the road to \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 235]\n\u00a0\n prison. It would be strange indeed that although neither the Government nor Anheuser-Busch could have sought an injunction against the acts here challenged, the elaborate efforts to permit such conduct failed to prevent criminal liability punishable with imprisonment and heavy fines. That is not the way to read the will of Congress, particularly when expressed by a statute which, as we have already indicated, is practically and historically one of a series of enactments touching one of the most sensitive national problems. Such legislation must not be read in a spirit of mutilating narrowness. On matters far less vital and far less interrelated we have had occasion to point out the importance of giving 'hospitable scope' to Congressional purpose even when meticulous words are lacking. Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, \n306 \nU.S. 381, 391\n, 59 S.Ct. 516, 519, and authorities there cited. The appropriate way to read legislation in a situation like the one before us, was indicated by Mr. Justice Holmes on circuit: 'A statute may indicate or require as its justification a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely to occur to the mind. The Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed. The major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but it is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before.' Johnson v. United States, 1 Cir., 163 F. 30, 32, 18 L.R.A.,N.S., 1194\n\n\n The relation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to the Clayton Act is not that of a tightly drawn amendment to a technically phrased tax provision. The underlying aim \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 236]\n\u00a0\n of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was to restore the broad purpose which Congress thought it had formulated in the Clayton Act but which was frustrated, so Congress believed, by unduly restrictive judicial construction. This was authoritatively stated by the House Committee on the Judiciary. 'The purpose of the bill is to protect the rights of labor in the same manner the Congress intended when it enacted the Clayton Act, October 15, 1914, 38 Stat.L. 738, which act, by reason of its construction and application by the Federal courts, is ineffectual to accomplish the congressional intent.' H.Rep. No. 669, 72d Congress, 1st Session, p. 3. The Norris-LaGuardia Act was a disapproval of Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, supra, and Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791, as the authoritative interpretation of  20 of the Clayton Act, for Congress now placed its own meaning upon that section. The Norris-LaGuardia Act reasserted the original purpose of the Clayton Act by infusing into it the immunized trade union activities as redefined by the later Act. In this light  20 removes all such allowable conduct from the taint of being 'violations of any law of the United States', including the Sherman Law.\n There is no profit in discussing those cases under the Clayton Act which were decided before the courts were furnished the light shed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act on the nature of the industrial conflict. And since the facts in the indictment are made lawful by the Clayton Act in so far as 'any law of the United States' is concerned, it would be idle to consider the Sherman Law apart from the Clayton Act as interpreted by Congress. Cf. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469\n, 60 S.Ct. 982, 128 A.L.R. 1044. It was precisely in order to minimize the difficulties to which the general language of the Sherman Law in its application to workers had given rise, that Congress cut through all the tangled verbalisms and enumerated concretely the types \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 237]\n\u00a0\n of activities which had become familiar incidents of union procedure.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the disposition of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (concurring).\n As I think it clear that the indictment fails to charge an offense under the Sherman Act, as it has been interpreted and applied by this Court, I find no occasion to consider the impact of the Norris-LaGuardia Act on the definition of participants in a labor dispute in the Clayton Act, as construed by this Court in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 16 A.L.R. 196-an application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act which is not free from doubt and which some of my brethren sharply challenge.\n The indictment is for a conspiracy to promote by peaceful means a local 'jurisdictional' strike in St. Louis, Missouri. Its aim is to determine whether the United Brotherhood of Carpenters or the International Association of Machinists, both labor organizations affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, shall be permitted to install certain machinery on the premises of Anheuser-Busch, Inc. in St. Louis. It appears that Anheuser-Busch brews beer and manufactures other products which it ships to points outside the state. It also uses supplies and building materials which are shipped to it from points outside the state. Borsari Tank Corporation is about to construct for Anheuser-Busch upon its premises a building for its use in brewing beer. L. O. Stocker Company has contracted and intends to construct an office building upon land of Anheuser-Busch adjacent to its brewery and leased by it to the Gaylord Container Corporation, a manufacturer of paper and cardboard containers which it ships in interstate commerce. It is al- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 238]\n\u00a0\n leged that both Borsari and Stocker will require and use in the construction of the buildings, materials to be shipped from points outside the state to the building sites on or adjacent to the Anheuser-Busch premises.\n The indictment charges that pursuant to the conspiracy to enforce the jurisdictional demands appellees, who are officers or representatives of the Brotherhood, called a strike of its members, some seventy-eight in number, in the employ of Anheuser-Busch, attempted to call sympathy strikes by members of other unions in its employ and caused the premises of Anheuser-Busch and the adjacent premises leased to Gaylord to be picketed by persons 'bearing umbrellas and charging Anheuser-Busch, Inc., to be unfair to organized labor; with the intent to shut down the brewery and manufacturing plant of Anheuser-Busch, Inc., to hinder and prevent the passage of persons and property to and from said premises and thus to restrain and stop the commerce of Anheuser-Busch' in the beer and other products manufactured by it, and in the supplies and materials procured by it extrastate, and 'to restrain the commerce' of Gaylord. It is alleged that pursuant to the conspiracy, defendants 'refused to permit members of the United Brotherhood ... to be employed and prevented such members from being employed by Borsari ... with the intent and effect of preventing construction of the building about to be built by Borsari ... and thus of restraining the commerce of Anheuser-Busch in beer ... and also with the knowledge and willful disregard of the consequent restraint and stoppage of commerce in the materials intended to be used by Borsari'. Like allegations are made with respect to Stocker with the added charge that the acts alleged were with intent to prevent performance of Stocker's contract with Gaylord 'with willful disregard of the consequent restraint of the commerce of Gaylord'. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 239]\n\u00a0\n There is the further allegation that pursuant to the conspiracy defendants and their co-conspirators have instigated and brought about a 'boycott of beer brewed by Anheuser-Busch ... and of dealers in said beer throughout the United States', by distributing to members of labor organizations and to the public at large in many states and by published notices circulated interstate 'denouncing Anheuser-Busch, Inc., as unfair to organized labor and calling upon all union members and friends of organized labor to refrain from purchasing and drinking said beer'.\n We are concerned with the alleged activities of defendants, actual or intended, only so far as they have an effect on commerce prohibited by the Sherman Act as it has been amended or restricted in its operation by the Clayton Act. The legality of the alleged restraint under the Sherman Act is not affected by characterizing the strike, as this indictment does, as 'jurisdictional' or as not within the 'legitimate object of a labor union'. The restraints charged are of two types: One is that resulting to the commerce of Anheuser-Busch, Borsari, Stocker and Gaylord from the peaceful picketing of the Anheuser-Busch premises, a part of which is leased to Gaylord, and the refusal of the Brotherhood to permit its members to work, and its prevention of its members from working (by what means other than picketing does not appear) for Borsari and Stocker. The other is that resulting from the requests addressed to the public to refrain from purchasing Anheuser-Busch beer.\n It is plain that the first type of restraint is only that which is incidental to the conduct of a local strike and which results from closing the plant of a manufacturer or builder who ships his product in interstate commerce, or who procures his supplies from points outside the state. Such restraints, incident to such a strike, upon the interstate transportation of the products or supplies has \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 240]\n\u00a0\n been repeatedly held by this Court, without a dissenting voice, not to be within the reach of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. There is here no allegation in the case of any of the employers of any interference, actual or intended, by strikers with goods moving or about to be shipped in interstate commerce such as was last term so sharply presented and held not to be a violation of the Sherman Act in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469\n, 60 S.Ct. 982, 128 A.L.R. 1044.\n With respect to Borsari and Stocker the indictment does no more than charge a local strike to enforce the jurisdictional demands upon Anheuser- Busch by the refusal of union members to work in the construction of buildings for Anheuser-Busch or upon its land, the work upon which, so far as appears, has not even begun. The restraint alleged is only that resulting from the 'disregard' by the strikers of the stoppage of the movement interstate of the building materials and the manufactured products of Gaylord consequent upon their refusal to construct the buildings. Precisely as in Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 549, where a local building strike with like consequences was held not to violate the Sherman law, there is wanting here any fact to show that the conspiracy was directed at the use of any particular building material in the states of origin and destination or its transportation between them 'with the plain design of suppressing or narrowing the interstate market', each of which were thought to be crucial in Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Ass'n, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 46\n, 47 S., 47 S.Ct. 522, 524, 525, 54 A.L.R. 791. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, \n310 \nU.S. 506\n, 60 S.Ct. 999, 128 A.L.R. 1044.\n As to the commerce of Anheuser-Busch and Gaylord, the indictment at most shows a conspiracy to picket peacefully their premises and publicly to charge the former with being unfair to organized labor, all with the intent to shut down the plant of Anheuser-Busch \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 241]\n\u00a0\n and to hinder and prevent the passage of persons and property to and from the premises and thus to restrain the commerce of Anheuser-Busch and Gaylord. There is also the allegation already noted that the refusal to work for Stocker will restrain the commerce of Gaylord, presummably because he will manufacture and ship less of his product if the proposed building is not completed.\n It is a novel proposition that allegations of local peaceful picketing of a manufacturing plant to enforce union demands concerning terms of employment accompanied by announcements that the employer is unfair to organized labor is a violation of the Sherman Act whatever effect on interstate commerce may be intended to follow from the acts done. They, like the allegations here, show only such effect upon interstate commerce as may be inferred from the acts alleged and in any event such restraint as there may be is not shown to be more than that which is incidental to every strike causing a shutdown of a manufacturing plant whose product moves in interstate commerce or stopping building operations where the builder is using materials shipped to him in interstate commerce. If the counts of the indictment which we are now considering make out an offense, then every local strike aimed at closing a shop whose products or supplies move in interstate commerce is, without more, a violation of the Sherman Act. They present a weaker case than those unanimously held by this Court not to involve violation of the Sherman Act in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co. (First Coronado Case), \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762; United Leather Workers' International Union v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Co., \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S.Ct. 623, 33 A.L.R. 566; Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, supra, and see Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers (Second Coronado Case), \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551, 556. In any case there is no allegation in the indictment that the restraint did or could operate to suppress competition \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 242]\n\u00a0\n in the market of any product and so dismissal of these counts is required by our decision in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra.\n The second and only other type of restraint upon interstate commerce charged is the so-called 'boycott' alleged to be by the publication of notices charging Anheuser-Busch with being unfair to labor and requesting members of the Union and the public not to purchase or use the Anheuser- Busch product. Were it necessary to a decision I should have thought that, since the strike against Anheuser-Busch was by its employees and there is no intimation that there is any strike against the distributors of the beer, that the strike was a labor dispute between employer and employees within the labor provisions of the Clayton Act as they were construed in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, supra. In that case  20 of the Act, as the opinion of the Court points out, makes lawful the action of any person* 'ceasing to patronize ... any party to such dispute' or 'recommending, advising or persuading others by peaceful (and lawful) means so to do.'\n Be that as it may, it is a sufficient answer to the asserted violation of the Sherman Act, by the publication of such notices and requests, to point out that the strike was by employees of Anheuser-Busch; that there was no boycott of or strike against any purchaser of Anheuser- Busch beer by any concerted action or refusal to patronize him by the purchase of beer or other products supplied by him such as was condemned in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 300-307, 28 S.Ct. 301, 308, 312, 13 Ann.Cas. 815; cf. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 243]\n\u00a0\n supra, \n310 \nU.S. 505\n, 60 S.Ct. 998, 128 A.L.R. 1044; and finally that the publication, unaccompanied by violence, of a notice that the employer is unfair to organized labor and requesting the public not to patronize him is an exercise of the right of free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment which cannot be made unlawful by act of Congress. See Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n I can only conclude that, upon principles hitherto recognized and established by the decisions of this Court, the indictment charges no violation of the Sherman Act.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I am of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n The indictment adequately charges a conspiracy to restrain trade and commerce with the specific purpose of preventing Anheuser-Busch from receiving in interstate commerce commodities and materials intended for use in its plant; of preventing the Borsari Corporation from obtaining materials in interstate commerce for use in performing a contract for Anheuser-Busch, and of preventing the Stocker Company from receiving materials in like manner for the construction of a building for the Gaylord Corporation. The indictment further charges that the conspiracy was to restrain interstate commerce flowing from Missouri into other states of products of Anheuser-Busch and generally to restrain the interstate trade and commerce of the three corporations named. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Without detailing the allegations of the indictment, it is sufficient to say that they undeniably charge a secondary boycott, affecting interstate commerce.\n This court, and many state tribunals, over a long period of years, have held such a secondary boycott illegal. In 1908 this court held such a secondary boycott, instigated to enforce the demands of a labor union against \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 244]\n\u00a0\n an employer, was a violation of the Sherman Act and could be restrained at the suit of the employer. \n2\n It is matter of history that labor unions insisted they were not within the purview of the Sherman Act but this court held to the contrary. As a result of continual agitation the Clayton Act was adopted. That Act, as amended, became effective October 15, 1914.3 Subsequently suits in equity were brought to restrain secondary boycotts similar to those involved in earlier cases. The contention was made that the Clayton Act exempted labor organizations from such suits. That contention was not sustained. \n4\n Upon the fullest consideration, this court reached the conclusion that the provisions of Section 20 of the Clayton Act governed not the substantive rights of persons and organizations but merely regulated the practice according to which, and the conditions under which, equitable relief might be granted in suits of this character. Section 6 has no bearing on the offense charged in this case.\n This court also unanimously held that a conspiracy such as is charged in the instant case renders the conspirators liable to criminal prosecution by the United States under the anti-trust acts. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n It is common knowledge that the agitation for complete exemption of labor unions from the provisions of the anti-trust laws persisted. Instead of granting the complete exemption desired, Congress adopted, March 23, 1932, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. \n6\n The title and the contents of that Act, as well as its legislative history,7 dem- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 245]\n\u00a0\n onstrate beyond question that its purpose was to define and to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts sitting in equity. The Act broadens the scope of labor disputes as theretofore understood, that is, disputes between an employer and his employes with respect to wages, hours, and working conditions, and provides that before a federal court can enter an injunction to restrain illegal acts certain preliminary findings, based on evidence, must be made. The Act further deprives the courts of the right to issue an injunction against the doing of certain acts by labor organizations or their members. It is unnecessary to detail the acts as to which the jurisdiction of a court of equity is abolished. It is sufficient to say, what a reading of the Act makes letter clear, that the jurisdiction of actions for damages authorized by the Sherman Act, and of the criminal offenses denounced by that Act, are not touched by the Norris- LaGuardia Act.\n By a process of construction never, as I think, heretofore indulged by this court, it is now found that, because Congress forbade the issuing of injunctions to restrain certain conduct, it intended to repeal the provisions of the Sherman Act authorizing actions at law and criminal prosecutions for the commission of torts and crimes defined by the anti- trust laws. The doctrine now announced seems to be that an indication of a change of policy in an Act as respects one specific item in a general field of the law, covered by an earlier Act, justifies this court in spelling out an implied repeal of the whole of the earlier statute as applied to conduct of the sort here involved. I venture to say that no court has ever undertaken so radically to legislate where Congress has refused so to do.8\n The construction of the act now adopted is the more clearly inadmissible when we remember that the scope \n\n[312 \nU.S. 219, 246]\n\u00a0\n of proposed amendments and repeals of the anti-trust laws in respect of labor organizations has been the subject of constant controversy and consideration in Congress. In the light of this history, to attribute to Congress an intent to repeal legislation which has had a definite and well understood scope and effect for decades past, by resurrecting a rejected construction of the Clayton Act and extending a policy strictly limited by the Congress itself in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, seems to me a usurpation by the courts of the function of the Congress not only novel but fraught, as well, with the most serious dangers to our constitutional system of division of powers.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 738, 29 U.S.C.  52, 29 U.S.C.A.  52: 'No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney.\n'Any no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; or from paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Whereas under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows. It is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.' 29 U.S.C.A.  102. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf.

Gen., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick H. Wood, of New York City, and John B. Gage, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case originated eleven years ago. As a result of proceedings begun in April, 1930 under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C.  181 et seq., 7 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq., the Secretary of Agriculture in June, 1933, issued an order setting maximum rates to be charged by market agencies for their services at the Kansas City Stockyards. The market agencies brought suit to set aside his order. The district court issued a temporary restraining order under which amounts charged in excess of the rates fixed by the order were impounded, and later it upheld the order. 8 F.Supp. 766. On appeal here, 7 U.S.C.  217, 7 U.S.C.A.  217; 28 U.S.C.  44, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  44, 47a, the case was sent back to the district court in order to determine on the issues raised by the pleadings whether the agencies had been denied the 'full hearing' demanded by  310 of the Act. \n298 \nU.S. 468\n, 56 S.Ct. 906. The district court thereupon decided that this requirement of the statute had been satisfied. 23 F.Supp. 380. The case was again brought here and the order of the Secretary \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 414]\n\u00a0\n was held invalid because of procedural defects. \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773. Prior to this decision, the Secretary and the market agencies had agreed upon a higher schedule of rates to become effective on December 1, 1937. However, under the impounding order which had continued in effect until that date over half a million dollars had been deposited. The disposit on of this fund was made a ground for a petition for rehearing after the second Morgan decision, but the petition was denied because that question was for the district court. \n304 \nU.S. 23, 26\n, 58 S.Ct. 999, 1001. The secretary then reopened the original proceedings to determine reasonable rates during the impounding period. Before the Secretary had made a new order the district court directed that the impounded moneys be turned over to the market agencies. 24 F.Supp. 214. The case came here for the third time, and we reversed the district court and required its retention of the fund 'until such time as the Secretary, proceeding with due expedition, shall have entered a final order in the proceedings pending before him'. \n307 \nU.S. 183, 198\n, 59 S.Ct. 795, 803. This decision was rendered on May 15, 1939. A month later the Secretary issued a new schedule of rates for the impounding period based on elaborate findings. Accordingly, the Government moved the district court to distribute the funds in accordance with the Secretary's order, but that court, with one of its three judges dissenting, held the order invalid and directed that the funds be given to the market agencies. 32 F. Supp. 546. The case is now here for the fourth time.\n The validity of the Secretary's order has undergone the closest scrutiny in elaborate briefs and extended oral arguments. Nothing has been overlooked. However, in the final stage of this long drawn out litigation, critical examination reveals only a few issues demanding attention.\n When the matter was last here we defined the duty of the Secretary. He was to determine reasonable rates for the impounding period so that there could be just dis- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 415]\n\u00a0\n tribution of the funds which the court below had taken into its registry. The nature of the problem before the Secretary was a guide to its solution. The Secretary's task was not the usual enterprise of fixing rates for the future, so largely an exercise in prophecy. Unique circumstances made him in 1939 the arbiter of rates for a period between 1933 and 1937. But even such a retrospective determination does not present a mathematical problem. Doubts and difficulties incapable of exact resolution confront judgment. More than that, since the Secretary is the guardian of the public interest in regulating a business of public concern it is not for him merely to reflect the items on a profit and loss statement. He must consider whether these represent services which properly should be charged to the public. While, therefore, the Secretary in determining rates for the past could not deny himself the benefit of hindsight, he was not merely a bookkeeper posting items into a ledger. Rates to which these public agencies were entitled were not to be derived merely from their expenditures and actual income.\n This Court defined the duty of the Secretary in its decision in the 307th U.S., 59 S.Ct. The record leaves no doubt that the Secretary, when he filed his order a month after that decision, appropriately discharged the duty. He served upon the market agencies the order of June 14, 1933, and the findings underlying it as the starting point of the inquiry. The market agencies protested against any order 'nunc pro tunc as of June 14, 1933', alleged that conditions had changed much since 1933, and asked for the appointment of an examiner to take new evidence. Because he deemed the earlier findings illuminating and helpful 'as a working basis for this hearing', the Secretary refused to withdraw them. But he appointed an examiner to hear new evidence and denied 'any intention of depriving the respondents of the opportunity of offering evidence concerning conditions affecting the reasonableness of their \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 416]\n\u00a0\n rates during the period subsequent to June 14, 1933'. He further stated that the 'forecasts of conditions' in the 1933 order 'can now be checked in light of subsequent events'. He neither purported to make nor did he make a nunc pro tunc order. The Secretary thus adopted a procedure which admitted whatever light was shed by change of circumstances after 1933. The market agencies freely availed themselves of this procedure; and the Secretary's findings leave no room for doubt that his conclusions represent a judgment of 1939 and not a prophecy of 1933. Having overruled the contention of Government counsel that evidence of conditions after 1933 was irrelevant, he took note of the fact that fewer livestock came to the market after 1933; that a larger number came by truck, thereby causing a decrease in the number of animals in an average consignment; that specific as well as general economic factors touching the market at Kansas City had changed; that statistics relevant in 1933 had become outmoded; and that he had before him evidence of expenses for 'business getting and maintaining' and salesmanship not before him in 1933. The Secretary thus unequivocally avowed his intention to consider conditions after 1933 and his findings carry out his purpose. \n1\n We must therefore reject the claim that the Secretary's judgment was founded on the misconception that he must shut his mind to everything that happened after 1933 and in 1939 fix rates in the imaginary world of 1933\n\n\n Another attack upon the Secretary's order is the con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 417]\n\u00a0\n ventional objection that the findings were not rooted in proof. To reexamine here with particularity the extensive findings made by the Secretary and to test them by a record of 1340 printed pages and thousands of pages of additional exhibits would in itself go a long way to convert a contest before the Secretary into one before the courts. Compare Litchfield v. Register and Receiver, 9 Wall. 575, 578. We have canvassed too fully in the past the duties respectively allotted to the Secretary of Agriculture and the courts in the enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act to justify extended discussion of the governing principles. Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220; Acker v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 426\n, 56 S.Ct. 824; see also United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 190\n, 191 S., 59 S. Ct. 795, 799. We are in the legislative realm of fixing rates. This is a task of striking a balance and reaching a judgment on factors beset with doubts and difficulties, uncertainty and speculation. On ultimate analysis the real question is whether the Secretary or a court should make an appraisal of elements having delusive certainty. Congress has put the responsibility on the Secretary and the Constitution does not deny the assignment.\n The objection that the proof does not support the findings is really a repetition in disguise of the unfounded claim that the Secretary misconceived his duty and made his order in 1939 as though he were acting in 1933. The bed rock of these variously phrased attacks upon the order is the contention that the Secretary was indifferent to events occurring after 1933. The short answer is that he was not. The conclusion which he drew from these events is another matter. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 418]\n\u00a0\n Specifically, it is urged that by the increase of rates for the future, to which the market agencies and the Secretary agreed in 1937, changes in circumstances were recognized, while the present order ignored these changes because its rates are at the same level as the original order. But the Secretary did not disregard changed market conditions during the impounding period. Evidence showing these changes was submitted by the market agencies. 3 He was thus duly apprised of the changes and \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 419]\n\u00a0\n they entered into the findings. To be sure, in ascertaining the reasonable rates for the impounding period he did not attach to them the significance which the market agencies drew from them. As a result of an elaborate study of conditions prior to 1933 and evidence indicating no essential change in those conditions for the purpose at hand during the later years, the Secretary concluded that the market was overstaffed and that in the competitive setting of the business amounts had been spent not justified by that public interest which he is charged to protect. Actual expenses for salesmen's salaries and 'business getting', the items chiefly in controversy, he found, did not furnish an adequate guide to the ascertainment of reasonable rates. Had the lower rates originally set by the Secretary in 1933 been tested by experience, audits of the market agencies under these rates would have reflected the practical operation of the policy of lowering costs under controlled conditions. But this source of experience was unavailable because the agencies throughout the impounding period continued to operate under the higher rates. Quite different considerations may properly have influenced the Secretary in fixing rates for the impounding period from those by which he determined a schedule of rates for the future. The existence of the differences is recognized in the agreement between the Secretary and the market agencies whereby the higher rates of the 1937 schedule were to be 'without prejudice' either to the Government or to the agencies \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 420]\n\u00a0\n in the present litigation. It was further agreed in 1937 that after six months, and unless the rate order of 1933 was found invalid, the Secretary could at any time 'without further hearing' reduce the rates for the future to the 1933 level. There were very great complexities in determining rates for an industry affected by the unstable conditions which surrounded the Kansas City market in 1937. And the expert tribunal charged with the task may well have felt a need for flexibility in the prophecy involved in setting future rates which did not enter the judgment required in fixing rates for a past period. It is not for us to try to penetrate the precise course of the Secretary's reasoning. Our duty is at an end when we find, as we do find, that the Secretary was responsibly conscious of conditions at the market during the years following 1933, that he duly weighed them, and nevertheless concluded that rates similar to those in the 1933 order were proper.\n But the market agencies go beyond saying that the record did not warrant what the Secretary found. They say that bias disqualified him. This serious charge derives from a letter written by the Secretary to the New York Times immediately following the decision of this Court in the second Morgan case, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773. By that decision, the Court had upset the order of 1933 because of procedural defects. Largely because of his assumption that this meant the return of the impounded funds to the market agencies, the Secretary in his letter vigorously criticized the decision. The market agencies in due course moved to disqualify the Secretary in the proceedings started by him to fix new rates. In denying their motion the Secretary wrote a patently sincere denial of bias. He stated that he had complained against a return of the impounded funds to the market agencies prior to a determination of the rates on the merits, that the denial of the petition for rehearing, \n304 \nU.S. 23, 26\n, 58 S.Ct. 999, 1001, had shown him the error of his assumption, that in his letter of criticism he \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 421]\n\u00a0\n made no prejudgment about the rates to be fixed, and that his only concern was to 'see that the substantive rights of the parties are fairly determined'. He added that 'as a matter of expediency' he might have disqualified himself but for the fact that, while the market agencies were pressing his disqualification, they were simultaneously urging that none other than the Secretary had legal authority to make the rate order. Plainly enough, when it was thus suggested that he create a situation in which no order could be made, the Secretary was offered no escape from his duty even had he preferred to consult the comforts of personal convenience.\n But, intrinsically, the letter did not require the Secretary's dignified denial of bias. That he not merely held but expressed strong views on matters believed by him to have been in issue, did not unfit him for exercising his duty in subsequent proceedings ordered by this Court. As well might it be argued that the judges below, who had three times heard this case, had disqualifying convictions. In publicly criticizing this Court's opinion the Secretary merely indulged in a practice familiar in the long history of Anglo-American litigation, whereby unsuccessful litigants and lawyers give vent to their disappointment in tavern or press. Cabinet officers charged by Congress with adjudicatory functions are not assumed to be flabby creatures any more than judges are. Both may have n underlying philosophy in approaching a specific case. But both are assumed to be men of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances. Nothing in this record disturbs such an assumption.\n And so we conclude that the order of the Secretary furnishes 'the appropriate basis for action in the district court in making distribution of the fund in its custody'. United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 198\n, 59 S.Ct. 795, 803. But, finally, a matter not touching the validity of the order requires consideration. Over the Government's objection the dis- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 422]\n\u00a0\n trict court authorized the market agencies to take the deposition of the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon appeared in person at the trial. He was questioned at length regarding the process by which he reached the conclusions of his order, including the manner and extent of his study of the record and his consultation with subordinates. His testimony shows that he dealt with the enormous record in a manner not unlike the practice of judges in similar situations, and that he held various conferences with the examiner who heard the evidence. Much was made of his disregard of a memorandum from one of his officials who, on reading the proposed order, urged considerations favorable to the market agencies. But the short of the business is that the Secretary should never have been subjected to this examination. The proceeding before the Secretary 'has a quality resembling that of a judicial proceeding'. Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 480\n, 56 S.Ct. 906, 911. Such an examination of a judge would be destructive of judicial responsibility. We have explicitly held in this very litigation that 'it was not the function of the court to probe the mental processes of the Secretary'. \n304 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 776. Just as a judge cannot be subjected to such a scrutiny, compare Fayerweather v. Ritch, \n195 \nU.S. 276, 306\n, 307 S., 25 S.Ct. 58, 67, so the integrity of the administrative process must be equally respected. See Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 27 S.Ct. 326, 327. It will bear repeating that although the administrative process has had a different development and pursues somewhat different ways from those of courts, they are to be deemed collaborative instrumentalities of justice and the appropriate independence of each should be respected by the other. United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 191\n, 59 S.Ct. 795, 799.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 423]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n With much that is said in the opinion of the Court I agree, but I am compelled to dissent from the conclusion. Despite the fact that this litigation has extended over many years I still think that not only the rights of the market agencies but the principles involved require the Court to take care that the litigation is disposed of in accordance with the principles it has laid down. The result now reached is not in accordance with those principles. A recital of the course of the litigation is necessary for an understanding of the case as now presented.\n Rates for the market agencies at Kansas City were fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture1 July 24, 1923. By virtue of the statute these became the legal rates and the agencies were bound not to exceed them until the further order of the Secretary. April 7, 1930, the Secretary instituted an inquiry into the existing rates. June 14, 1933, he issued an order reducing them.\n July 19, 1933, the market agencies brought suit to enjoin and set aside the order. The District Court entered a temporary injunction July 22, 1933, in connection with which it provided that the difference between the rates be ng charged by the agencies and those fixed by the order under attack should be impounded pending the outcome of the litigation. Upon the trial of the cause the court refused to consider an issue tendered by the agencies as to whether the Secretary had granted them a full hearing. Upon examination of the record, it held the order was supported by substantial evidence and, on October 29, 1934, dismissed the bill. \n2\n This Court reversed, on May 25, 1936, holding that the District Court should have con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 424]\n\u00a0\n sidered and decided the question whether the agencies had been afforded a full hearing. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n On a further trial the District Court again upheld the order by a decree of July 2, 1937.4 The United States appealed from this decree. In the meantime, however, a significant thing occurred. On November 14, 1937, the Secretary approved new rates, effective November 1, 1937, in recognition of changed conditions existing in the business at Kansas City. The impounding order, therefore, ceased to operate November 1, 1937.\n This Court reversed the second decree of the District Court because it found that the agencies had been denied a full hearing in the proceedings which eventuated in the order of 1933. Its decision was rendered April 25, 1938, and a rehearing was denied May 31, 1938.5\n The Secretary and his legal advisers evidently believed, and, as I think, correctly, that the old rates authorized in 1923 stood until a new order, lawfully made, superseded them for the future. The rates fixed for the future by the order of 1933 had not become effective and the Act contained no provision for altering rates charged in the past under authority of the existing and outstanding order of 1923, or granting reparation in respect of them. The Secretary seems to have thought that he could reach this situation by the entry of a nunc pro tunc order as of July 14, 1933. On June 2, 1938, therefore, he directed that the proceeding be reopened and that the 'proceedings, findings of fact, conclusion and order' issued on June 14, 1933, be served upon the agencies as the 'Tentative Findings of Fact, Conclusion and Proposed Order' of the Secretary, and he denominated them as 'Tentative Findings of Fact, Conclusion, and Proposed Order' issued as of June 14, 1933. It is plain that he proposed thus to cure what had \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 425]\n\u00a0\n been found to be the defect in the order by affording the market agencies an opportunity to file and argue exceptions, in an effort to show any infirmity in the findings and conclusion on which the 1933 order was based. If none was made to appear, he proposed to issue the order nunc pro tunc as of its original date. It is true that after exceptions were filed and upon the hearing before an examiner the agencies were permitted to offer evidence to show changed conditions supervening in the period between 1933 and 1937. It is also true that while the examiner retained all of the findings previously made as the foundation for the order of 1933 he added certain findings but he did not, in any material respect, alter the ultimate findings and, indeed, he retained the exact rates fixed in the earlier order and left undisturbed every finding as to cost (with one immaterial exception), even to the fourth decimal place, as it had stood in the original report.\n Immediately after the reopening of the proceeding consequent upon the decision of this Court of May 31, 1938, the Secretary, on June 12, 1938, applied to the District Court for an order staying the distribution of the impounded funds pending his further decision and order. In his petition he said: 'After a full hearing the Secretary will determine by an order as of June 14, 1933, what rates may reasonably be charged by petitioners to their clients for the services rendered them.' The District Court denied the application. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The United States appealed from the decree. In its brief it stated: 'The only purpose and effect ... (of the reopened proceeding) is to determien whether and to what extent the appellees have been prejudiced by the procedural defect in the earlier proceeding.'\n Before the case had been decided here the reopened proceeding before the Secretary had so progressed that \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 426]\n\u00a0\n the evidence had been closed, a tentative report made by an examiner, exceptions filed, and argument heard by the Secretary. The record plainly discloses that up to the time of our final decision on this last appeal the Secretary had been content to take the data disclosed by his investigation of the market agencies' activities in the years 1929, 1930 and 1931, as the basis of any order and this was natural if, as he then supposed, he was justified in entering an order nunc pro tunc as of the date of his original 1933 order.\n This Court rendered its opinion in the last appeal May 15, 1939.7 Speaking by a majority, the Court there held that as the District Court was acting as a court of equity in the premises the impounded funds should be disbursed according to the equities of the situation. It adverted to the fact that the rates fixed by the Secretary October 14, 1937, governed for the future until altered in accordance with law, but it held that the equities of the case required an investigation as to whether the rates charged in the interval between 1933 and 1937 had been unreasonable and, as a result, whether it would be inequitable to withhold from the market agencies' customers and return to the market agencies all or any part of the impounded fund. The court was of the view that the Secretary was in a peculiarly favorable position to find the facts and advise the court upon this subject and that the court ought to cooperate with the Secretary to attain a just result.\n At this juncture the reopened proceeding was under submission before the Secretary. It is to be noted that he had refused to consider the data in his own possession with respect to the actual experience of two of the market agencies which had conformed to the rates he fixed in 1933. It is further to be noted that the existence of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 427]\n\u00a0\n changed conditions not only is shown by the uncontradicted evidence offered by the agencies but by the fact that the Secretary recognized such change in making his order of October 14, 1937.\n The court below has found that conditions in the business had substantially, and in some respects radically changed since the completion of the original record on which the 1933 order was based. The court found the facts as to the changes which had increased the cost of doing the business. The government does not question the correctness of these findings. I think these increased costs cannot be ignored or dismissed with the comment that the Secretary considered them, when it is plain he did not. This Court did not intend by its decision in 1939 that the Secretary should shut his eyes to these changed conditions, and make a forecast in 1939 as of 1933 and upon the data available in 1933, as if he had before him only the experience prior to 1933 and were then acting. Of a similar situation this Court has said: 'A forecast gives us one rate. A survey gives another. To prefer the forecast to the survey is an arbitrary judgment.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The Secretary had made a careful investigation of the operations of the market agencies in the years prior to 1933. The same data was available to him in 1939 for the period 1933 to 1937, but was not considered. What he should have done, in the light of this Court's decision, was again to reopen the cause and to investigate the fairness and reasonableness of the charges exacted from 1933 to 1937 in the light of actual experience. To assert that he did in fact pursue this course is to place an unjustified gloss upon the record now befor the Court.\n We ought not to conclude the parties by a strained construction of the record facts, or by applying to this \n\n[313 \nU.S. 409, 428]\n\u00a0\n inquiry technical rules of evidence and procedure which have not place in such a proceeding. On the contrary, we should require that to be done which the broad equities of the case demand. No less, it seems to me, will satisfy the mandate of this Court in its earlier pronouncement. I should, therefore, reverse the decree and direct that the Secretary ascertain the facts upon all available evidence, in accordance with the decisions of this Court when the case was last here. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Attention is called to the title page of the tentative findings on which appeared, opposite the docket number of the case and the names of the formal parties, the words 'Tentative Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Proposed Order, issued as of June 14, 1933'. This formal caption is not an unnatural description of the starting point of the Secretary's new inquiry. It clearly is not descriptive of his final findings and order, let alone a denial of the proper theory on which he avowedly proceeded. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That inferences from facts and contentions regarding their significance are the real stuff of these rate determinations is well illustrated by the phase of the problem before the Secretary that was most strongly pressed upon us. It is undisputed that since 1933 the arrival of animals by truck has increased, thereby causing a decrease in the average number of animals in a consignment. And since the consignment is the unit of cost, a decrease in the number of animals results in an increase in cost per head in the consignment. Hence, formal logic concludes, the present order in setting the same rates as those of 1933 fails to reflect this increase in per head cost, and on that ground is invalid. But both the 1933 and 1939 schedules recognize that there are minimal costs unrelated to the number of animals in a consignment. Both orders, therefore, were graduated according to the number of animals in a consignment. The Secretary found that this graduated scale which 'produces an increasing per head revenue as the number of head in the consignment decreases' would 'give recognition to the changing method of arrival of livestock'. Moreover, the decrease in the size of consignments may well have been reflected in the increased estimate of salesmanship cost. All these considerations only illustrate that we are moving in a difficult and specialized realm of judgment which has been entrusted to the Secretary of Agriculture and not to the courts. The Secretary's judgment must prevail since his finding had the support of inferences fairly drawn from the entire evidence, including all that the market agencies saw fit to introduce bearing on their operations after 1933. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] An objection to an exclusion of evidence by the examiner requires but slight comment. Two cooperative commission companies had accepted the rates of the Secretary's order of 1933, and the market agencies asked that the annual reports of these companies for the impounding period be produced by the division of the Department of Agriculture with which they were filed. The examiner refused to order production of the reports on the ground that he had no authority to do so, basing his ruling on a section which the Packers and Stockyards Act incorporates from the Federal Trade Commission Act and which provides that it shall be a misdemeanor for any officer of the regulatory agency to make public any information which the agency has obtained 'without its authority, unless directed by a court'. 7 U.S.C.  222, 15 U.S.C.  50, 7 U.S.C.A.  222, 15 U.S.C.A.  50. We need not determine whether the reports should properly have been admitted. If they should have been, the statute provides an orderly way for having this done during the course of the hearing by seeking the Secretary's authorization. Having failed to pursue the way of the statute, the market agencies were debarred from raising the matter at a later time. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Several incumbents of the office acted in the case at successive dates. The term Secretary is used to designate the official who acted in any instance. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 F.Supp. 766. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n298 \nU.S. 468\n, 56 S.Ct. 906. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 23 F.Supp. 380. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n304 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 58 S.Ct. 77o, 999, 1135. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 24 F.Supp. 214. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \n307 \nU.S. 183\n, 59 S.Ct. 795. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] West Ohio Gas Co. v.

RESLER(1941)\nNo. 616\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Fowler Hamilton, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Harry S. Silverstein, of Denver, Colo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal presents two important questions affecting the administration of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.A .  301 et seq. The first is whether  213(e) places beyond reach of  212( b) transfers of operating rights where not more than twenty vehicles are involved. The second is whether the Interstate Commerce Commission possessed statutory authority to rule that assent of the Commission is a condition precedent to an effective transfer which is subject to  212(b).\n In July, 1940, the United States filed an information against appellee charging that he had engaged in interstate motor carrier operations over a specified route in Colorado without a certificate of public convenience and necessity required by  206(a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. Appellee filed a special plea in bar alleging in substance that he had not violated  206(a) because he had cquired the requisite certificate from one Brady to whom it had been issued originally, and that the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission was not necessary to validate that transfer. The District Court sustained this plea, and the United States appealed directly to this court. 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. Counsel for appellant and appellee have stipulated that not more than twenty vehicles were involved in the transfer from \n\n[313 \nU.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n Brady to appellee, and that the Interstate Commerce Commission has not approved that transfer.\n The transfer is governed by  212(b). That section provides: 'Except as provided in section 213 (313), any certificate or permit may be transferred, pursuant to such rules and regulations as the (Interstate Commerce) Commission may prescribe.' Section 213, regulating consolidations, mergers, and other acquisitions of control of motor carriers, provides in subsection (e) that '... the provisions of this section requiring authority from the Commission for consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract, or acquisition of control shall not apply where the total number of motor vehicles involved is not more than twenty.'\n The obvious sense of  212(b) could hardly be expressed more aptly than in the language quoted. Section 213(e) is equally explicit. Read together, the two sections can mean only that a transfer involving not more than twenty vehicles is governed by  212(b) and the regulations enacted pursuant to it. The phrase 'Except as provided in section 213 (313)' was intended to remove from the sweep of  212(b) only those transfers which were within the compass of  213. It was never intended to place beyond reach of  212(b) the transfers which  213(e) expressly placed beyond reach of  213.\n Notwithstanding the fact that the instant transfer is subject to  212(b), appellee challenges the Commission's authority to enact Rule 1(d) which provides: 'No attempted transfer of any operating right shall be effective except upon full compliance with these rules and regulations and until after the Interstate Commerce Commission has approved such transfer as herein provided. ...' Order of July 1, 1938, 3 Fed.Reg. 2157\n\n\n Power to make rules regulating the transfers embraced in  212(b) derives from the phrase in that section 'pursuant to such rules and regulations as the Commission \n\n[313 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n may prescribe', and from  204(a)(6) which makes it the duty of the Commission to 'administer, execute, and enforce all provisions of (the Motor Carrier Act), to make all necessary orders in connection therewith, and to prescribe rules, regulations, and procedure for such administration ....' Undoubtedly the power to prescribe regulations is not unlimited, but neither section provides or implies that the Commission is without authority to rule that parties to a proposed transfer which is governed by  212(b) must first obtain the consent of the Commission. Indeed, the conclusion is inescapable that such a rule is clearly within the regulatory power which Congress intended to confer on the Commission, for Congress could insure effective enforcement of other sections of the Act only by granting the Commission power to enact regulations broad enough to authorize Rule 1(d).\n Sections 213(a) and 213(b) carefully provide in detail for the regulation of transfers of operating rights by merger, consolidation, or by other specified means. Section 213(a)(1) expressly stipulates that the approval of the Commission must precede a transfer which is subject to  213. Manifestly, the administration of  213(a) and 213(b) would be seriously hampered if the Commission were powerless to make the same requirement with respect to transfers subject to  212(b), particularly since the number of vehicles involved may determine which section is applicable.\n In many respects a transferee such as appellee stands in the same relation to the Commission as an original applicant for permission to operate. Many inquiries which are elevant to the initial application are equally relevant to the proposed transfer. Section 206(a), with immaterial exceptions, permits common carriers by motor vehicles to operate only if the carrier has first obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Section 207(a) expressly conditions issuance of the cer- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n tificate on findings by the Commission that the applicant is 'fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of (the Motor Carrier Act) and the requirements, rules, and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and that the proposed service, to the extent to be authorized by the certificate, is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.' Plainly the finding of the requisite fitness, willingness, and ability of the first applicant is wholly inapplicable to his proposed transferee (see Rule 2(c), 3 Fed.Reg. 2158), and the operations inceptively authorized no longer may serve public convenience and necessity because conditions have changed. See rule 6, 3 Fed.Reg. 2158; compare  208(a), 212(a). It is evident that full enforcement of  206(a) and 207(a) likewise would be impeded if the Commission lacked power to rule that its consent must precede a transfer subject to  212(b).1\n We conclude that the Commission acted within its authority to prescribe rules and regulations to implement  212(b) in ruling that its consent was a condition precedent to an effective transfer governed by that section. It was not compelled to contest the legality or propriety of such a transfer after it had been completed.\n The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Absent such power, the Commission would encounter similar difficulties in the administration of other sections. Section 215 requires the Commission to withhold a certificate until the carrier has complied with Commission regulations exacting security for damage to persons and property. Section 217 compels specified carriers to file tariff schedules. Section 221 obligates motor carriers to file written designations of agents for service of process and Commission orders.\n See also  220, 223. \n\n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. STATE OF ALABAMA(1941)\nNo. 12\nArgued: April 28, 1941Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 275]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. en., and Norman W. Littell, Asst. Atty. Gen., for complainant.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 277]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Edward Thornton and John W. Lapsley, both of Montgomery, Ala., for defendant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought this suit to quiet its title to land in Macon County, Alabama. The complaint alleges that the State of Alabama is asserting liens as attaching to the land on October 1, 1936, for state and county taxes for the tax year 1937; and further that the State claims an interest in the land by reason of tax sales and the issue to the State of certificates of purchase. The Government asks a decree declaring the liens, tax sales and certificates of purchase to be invalid and enjoining the State from asserting its claims. The case was heard on bill and answer.\n There are three tracts involved, which were conveyed by the owners to the United States on October 1, 1936, December 10, 1936, and March 10, 1937, respectively.\n The applicable statute of Alabama1 provides that 'From and after the first day of October of each year, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 278]\n\u00a0\n when property becomes assessable the State shall have a lien upon each and every piece or parcel of property owned by any taxpayer for the payment of all taxes which may be assessed against him ... which lien shall continue until such taxes are paid'. The county is to have a like lien for taxes assessed by it. These liens are made superior to all other liens and may be enforced by sale as provided in the Act.\n Under the statute, the process of assessment for the tax year 1937 began on October 1, 1936. The grantors in the above mentioned conveyances, as the respective owners on that date, made their returns and in due course the tax assessor listed and valued the several tracts. \n2\n His \n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 279]\n\u00a0\n valuations were certified as provided by the statute to the county board of review, which by virtue of its authority to fix valuations, made the definitive assessments. 3 It appears that the board of review met on March 8, 1937, and adjourned on March 20, 1937. It also appears that the rate for state taxes had been fixed by the statute,4 and the rate for county taxes was set on February 8, 1937, under the authority given o the court of county commissioners. \n5\n The school district tax was approved by the electors of the school district at an election held on June 14, 1937. The taxes for the year 1937 became payable on October 1, 1937, and became delinquent on January 1, 1938.6 Proceedings were then instituted in the county court for the sale of the lands, and under its decrees the sales took place on June 12, 1939. The lands were sold to the State and certificates of purchase were issued accordingly.\n First.-The Government, invoking the principle that lands owned by the United States cannot be taxed by a State (Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151\n, 6 S.Ct. 670) contends that the asserted liens are without validity because at the time the tracts were acquired by the United States the amount of the taxes had not been ascertained, as the values had not then been assessed and the rates of taxation had not been fixed. Therefore it is said that the taxes had not then been imposed. The argument is that the Alabama tax statute does not 'impose taxes' but 'secures their payment' and that unless taxes are imposed the statute has no effect. The lien, it is urged, becomes 'fixed and final' only when the taxes have been ascertained 'by completion of levy and assessment'.\n There is no question however, as the Government concedes, that the state statute purports to impose a lien as \n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 280]\n\u00a0\n of October 1, 1936, for the taxes which by the process of assessment were to become payable for the tax year 1937. October first is fixed as the tax day, and as of that day owners are to make their returns, values are to be fixed and the taxes laid. There is no question that the State thus undertakes to create an inchoate lien upon the lands as of the tax day, a lien which is to be effective for the amount of the taxes for the ensuing year as these are fixed by the defined statutory method. This lien by the state law is made effective not only as against the owners on the tax day but also as against subsequent mortgagees and purchasers. 'It follows the land in the hands of the vendee, all persons being chargeable with a knowledge of its existence'. Driggers v. Cassady, 71 Ala. 529, 534. See, also, Swann v. State, 77 Ala. 545; State v. Alabama Educational Foundation, 231 Ala. 11, 16, 163 So. 527. We find nothing in the Federal Constitution which invalidates such a statutory scheme. Subsequent lienors and purchasers have due notice of the tax liability imposed as of the tax day and of the process of assessment, and that liability, when its amount is definitely ascertained, relates back to the day specified. We recognized the validity of such a provision in New York v. Maclay, \n288 \nU.S. 290, 292\n, 53 S.Ct. 323, 324, where we observed that a tax lien created in a similar manner under a statute of New York 'is effective for many purposes, though its amount is undetermined. It is notice to mortgagees or purchasers, who are held to loan or purchase at their own risk if they take their mortgages or deeds before the tax has been assessed or paid'. The precise decision in that case allowing priority to the United States under R.S.  3466, 31 U.S.C.A.  191, for debts due by an insolvent corporation over claims of the State for franchise taxes due but not assessed or liquidated until after a receivership, in no way detracted from the recognition of the effectiveness of the state law creating a lien as against mortgagees and purchasers. As the court said, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 281]\n\u00a0\n 'Against mortgagees and purchasers a lien perfected afterwards may take effect by relation as of the date of the inchoate lien through which mortgagees and purchasers become chargeable with notice'. 288 U.S. page 293, 53 S.Ct. 324. See also, Osterberg v. Union Trust Co., \n93 \nU.S. 424, 425\n, 428 S.; People v. Commissioners, \n104 \nU.S. 466, 468\n, 26 S. L.Ed 632. Compare Shotwell v. Moore, \n129 \nU.S. 590, 598\n, 9 S.Ct. 362, 364. The lien in such a case, though inchoate on the day specified, and maturing when the extent of liability is ascertained by the statutory process, is similar in that respect, as the court said in the Maclay case, to the lien of a transfer tax or duty upon the estate of a decedent which is effective although the amount is ascertained after death.\n Our present inquiry is whether, assuming the validity of the state statute creating a lien as of October 1, 1936, as against other subsequent purchasers, it should be deemed invalid as against the United States. The question is not whether such a lien could be enforced against the United States. The fact that the United States had taken title and that proceedings could not be taken against the United States without its consent would protect it against such enforcement. But that immunity would not be predicated upon the invalidity of the lien. If in this instance title had been taken by the United States in the summer of 1937 after the amount of the taxes had been ascertained and the respective liens were concededly valid, still proceedings against the United States could not be prosecuted without its consent.\n The Government is not content with that measure of protection. The Government brings this suit in the view that it is entitled to have a marketable title and it seeks to remove the liens in question as clouds upon that title which would interfere with the disposition of the lands in the future. From that standpoint the Government asks a decree declaring the invalidity of the liens and enjoining the State from asserting any claim in the lands \n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 282]\n\u00a0\n either adverse to the United States or to its successors in title. We think that the United States is not entitled to that relief. The United States took the conveyances with knowledge of the state law fixing the lien as of October 1st. That law in creating such liens for the taxes subsequently assessed in due course and making them effective as against subsequent purchasers did not contravene the Constitution of the United States and we perceive no reason why the United States, albeit protected with respect to proceedings against it without its consent, should stand, so far as the existence of the liens is concerned, in any different position from that of other purchasers of lands in Alabama who take conveyances on and after the specified tax date. It is familiar practice for grantees who take title in such circumstances to see that provision is made for the payment of taxes and the Government could easily have protected itself in like manner. Finding no constitutional infirmity in the state legislation, we think that the liens should be held valid.\n We make no exception of the tract conveyed to the United States on the tax day, October 1, 1936, as we think the state statute, as contended by the State, is to be deemed effective from the moment the tax day began. See Beck v. Johnson, 235 Ala. 323, 324, 179 So. 225.\n Second.-With respect to the tax sales the case has a different aspect. The proceedings in the county court for the sale of the lands were taken and the decrees were rendered after the United States had become the owner of the tracts. A proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States. The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 154. The United States was an indispensable party to proceedings for the sale of the lands, and in the absence of its consent to the prosecution of such proceedings, the county court was without jurisdiction and its decrees, the tax sales and the certificates of purchase issued to the State were void. Minnesota v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 382, 386\n, 59 S.Ct. 292, 294. While \n\n[313 \nU.S. 274, 283]\n\u00a0\n pleading to the contrary in its answer, the invalidity of the tax sales is now conceded by the State.\n The United States is entitled to a decree setting aside the tax sales and the certificates of pu chase, and in other respects the complaint is dismissed.\n It is so ordered.\n Decree for plaintiff in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 372, Act No. 194, General Acts Alabama, 1935, p. 566, is as follows:\n'From and after the first day of October of each year, when property becomes assessable the State shall have a lien upon each and every piece or parcel of property owned by any taxpayer for the payment of all taxes which may be assessed against him and upon each piece and parcel of property real or personal assessed to owner unknown which lien shall continue until such taxes are paid, and the county shall have a like lien thereon for the payment of the taxes which may be assessed by it; and if such property is within the limits of a municipal corporation such municipal corporation shall have a like lien thereon for the payment of the taxes which may be assessed by it. These liens shall be superior to all other liens and shall exist in the order named and each of such liens may be enforced and foreclosed by sale for taxes as provided in this Act, or as other liens upon property are enforced.'\n\n The State also cites Section 8874 of Article 6, Chapter 314, of the Code of Alabama, 1923, which provides:\n'From and after the first day of October of each year, the state shall have a prior lien upon each and every piece or parcel of property, real or personal, for the payment of any and all taxes which may be assessed against the owner, or upon such property, during that year, for the use of the state; and the county shall have a like lien thereon for the payment of the taxes which may be assessed against such owner, or upon such property, during that year, for the use of the county; and these liens shall exist as to all lands bid in by the state at tax sales for the annual taxes thereafter assessed on the value of the property so purchased, in the event of the tax title failing'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act No. 194, General Acts Alabama, 1935, Sec. 29, p. 274. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Id., Secs. 50, 72, pp. 284, 292. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Id., Sec. 7, p. 263. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Id., Sec. 64, p. 288. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Id., Sec. 11, p. 267. \n\n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. STATE OF TEXAS(1941)\nNo. 44\nArgued: Decided: December 22, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 481]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Pat M. Neff, Jr., of Austin, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n W. L. Nix was a manufacturer and distributor of motor fuel, doing business in Texas under the name of Texas Refinery. On November 20, 1933, M. R. Ingraham, who held a demand note secured by a chattel mortgage on certain tanks belonging to Nix, brought an action in the District Court of Gregg County, Texas. He alleged that demand had been made on the note, that it had not been paid, that Nix owned no property in Texas other than that of Texas Refinery, that the value of the mortgaged tanks was insufficient to discharge the note, that the tanks were not used 'for a separate purpose' but in the 'operation of the said refinery as a unit,' and that Nix was insolvent. He asked that judgment be entered in his favor for the amount of the note, that the mortgage be foreclosed, and that in the meantime a receiver be placed in charge of 'the whole of the property' of Texas Refinery. On the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 482]\n\u00a0\n same day a receiver was appointed, and he was subsequently authorized to sell all of the refinery property.\n On November 21, R.P. Ash intervened in the proceedings as the holder of an overdue note secured by a mortgage on the physical plant of the refinery not subject to the Ingraham mortgage. Both the state of Texas and the United States then intervened with the claims for state and federal gasoline taxes which are the subject of the present dispute. Later both the Ingraham and Ash mortgage notes were assigned to Howard Dailey.\n The District Court found that Nix was insolvent on November 20, 1933, and continued to be insolvent thereafter. The sum available for distribution after sale of the refinery property by the receiver was $7466. 92. The court found that of these proceeds $1294.80 was allocable to those assets which were subject to the mortgages held by Dailey, and it ordered that his claim to that amount be first satisfied. It determined that Nix was liable to the United States for $19,343.91 in federal gasoline taxes, and to Texas for $40,312.51 in state gasoline taxes. As between the state and federal claims, it decided that the United States was entitled to priority and concluded that nothing would be left to apply to the Texas claim.\n From this order Texas appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals for the Second District. That court certified the controlling questions to the Supreme Court of Texas. The Supreme Court, on the authority of State v. Wynne, 134 Tex. 455, 133 S.W.2d 951, a companion case decided the same day, answered the questions in such a way as to require that the claim of Texas be first satisfied, that of Dailey second, and that of the United States third. State v. Nix, 134 Tex. 476, 133 S.W.2d 963. The Court of Civil Appeals thereupon so ruled, noting that the assets available would not completely satisfy even the claim of Texas and that Dailey and the United States would receive nothing. State v. Nix, 138 S.W.2d 924. A motion by the United States for a rehearing was denied, and the Supreme Court of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 483]\n\u00a0\n Texas refused to review the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals. We granted the petition of the United States for certiorari because of the important question of the fiscal relationship between state and federal governments which is involved. \n313 \nU.S. 554\n, 61 S.Ct. 1085\n\n\n No question as to the rights of Dailey, the mortgagee, is raised by this appeal. We confine ourselves, therefore, to the only question presently open to decision: the relative priority of the claims of the United States and Texas.\n The United States rests its assertion of priority upon  3466 of the Revised Statutes. \n1\n Despite the contention of Texas to the contrary, that section clearly applies to this proceeding. As we recently remarked in United States v. Emory,2  3466 covers in terms the case of an insolvent debtor who has committed an act of bankruptcy, and there are few more familiar examples of an act of bankruptcy than the appointment of a receiver because of the debtor's insolvency. Cf.  3, sub. a(4), of the Bankruptcy Act, U.S.C., Title 11,  21, sub. a(4), 11 U.S.C.A.  21, sub. a(4). Here the district court expressly found that Nix was insolvent, and it appointed a receiver. It is true that the original petition was filed by a mortgagee rather than by a general creditor. But if any limitations upon the operation of  3466 might otherwise have flowed from this circumstance they were removed by the subsequent character of the proceeding. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 484]\n\u00a0\n The receiver was placed in control of all of Nix's assets, rather than only those subject to the mortgage, and all of the assets were eventually liquidated. Parties other than the mortgagee, including Texas itself, intervened and were heard. We think that realities require us to treat the proceeding as a general equity receivership within the scope of  3466.\n We are thus brought to the important issue in the case. Article 7065a- 7 of the Vernon's Annotated Texas Civil Statutes declared that all gasoline taxes due by any distributor to the state 'shall be a preferred lien, first and prior to any and all other existing liens, upon all of the property of any distributor, devoted to or used in his business as a distributor ....'3 It is the state's position that under this section it held a specific and perfected lien upon the refinery property which entitled it to priority despite  3466 of the Revised Statutes.\n Section 3466 mentions no exception to its requirement that 'the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.' It is nevertheless true that in several early decisions this Court read an exception into the section in the case of previously executed mortgages. Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat. 396, 426; Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 1 Pet. 386; Brent v. Bank of Washington, 10 Pet. 596, 611, 612. This doctrine seems to have been based on the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 485]\n\u00a0\n theory that mortgaged property passes to the mortgagee and is no longer a part of the estate of the mortgagor. See Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., supra, 1 Pet. at pages 441, 442. The question of whether the priority of the United States under  3466 would also be defeated by a specific and perfected lien upon property whose title remained in the debtor was reserved in those cases. Id; Brent v. Bank of Washington, supra, 10 Pet. at pages 611, 612. However, it was determined that a general judgment lien upon the lands of an insolvent debtor does not take precedence over claims of the United States unless execution of the judgment has proceeded far enough to take the land out of the possession of the debtor. Thelusson v. Smith, supra, 2 Wheat. at pages 425, 426.\n In more recent years the Court has had occasion to consider the argument that liens created in favor of states or counties by state statutes entitled them to priority over the United States under  3466. In Spokane County v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 80\n, 49 S.Ct. 321, the priority of the United States was upheld. The state statutes involved provided that if a certain personal property tax was not paid, and if the personal property against which it had been assessed was no longer in the hands of the delinquent taxpayer, the amount of the unpaid tax should become a lien upon all the real and personal property of the taxpayer. They went on to prescribe the procedure by which the lien was to be enforced. The Court determined that the statutory lien did not become specific until this procedure had been followed. Since these procedural conditions had not been satisfied in the case before it, the Court refused priority to the tax claims of the county. It specifically declined to consider what 'the effect of more completed procedure in the perfecting of the liens under the law of the state' would have been. 279 U.S. at page 95, 49 S.Ct. at page 325.\n The New York statute in New York v. Maclay, \n288 \nU.S. 290\n, 53 S.Ct. 323, declared that the corporate franchise tax there involved should 'be a lien and binding upon the real \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 486]\n\u00a0\n and personal property of the corporation ... until the same is paid in full.' 288 U.S. at page 292, 53 S.Ct. at pages 323, 324. Although the franchise taxes in question were overdue, the state had taken no steps to perfect and liquidate its lien at the time the receiver was appointed for the insolvent corporation. Under such circumstances, the Court was of the opinion that the tax claim of the state did not deprive the claim of the United States of its priority under  3466. It was at pains to make clear, however, that it intended by its decision to lend no support to the assumption that the doctrine of the mortgage cases, whatever its current vitality, would require the subordination of unsecured claims of the United States to a specific and perfected lien. 288 U.S. at pages 293, 294, 53 S.Ct. at page 324.4\n We think that it is equally unnecessary to test that assumption here. Prior to the appointment of the receiver on November 20, 1933, the state of Texas had made no move to assert the lien proclaimed in Article 7065a-7. And the priority which attached to the claim of the United States on that day (United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253, 260\n, 43 S.Ct. 295, 297) could not be divested by any subsequent proceedings in connection with the state's lien. New York v. Maclay, supra, 288 U.S. at page 293, 53 S.Ct. at page 324.\n It is urged, however, that Article 7065a-7 by its own force creates a specific and perfected lien. Support for this contention is said to lie in the fact that the statutory lien purports to affect only the property of the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 487]\n\u00a0\n distributor which is 'devoted to or used in his business as a distributor' rather than his property in general. This is thought to make the lien sufficiently specific. Moreover, the State argues, and the Supreme Court of Texas has declared,5 that the provisions of the Texas Civil Statutes which govern the levy, seizure and sale of the property of delinquent taxpayers generally6 are inapplicable to the gasoline tax. We are of course bound by this authoritative construction of the statute.\n With respect to this contention it may first be said that the property 'devoted to or used in his business as a distributor' is neither specific nor constant. But a more important consideration is that the amount of the claim secured by the lien is unliquidated and uncertain. As we said in New York v. Maclay: 'If the state were to ... omit to ascertain the debt, it would never be able to sell anything, for it would not know how much to sell.' 288 U.S. at page 293, 53 S.Ct. at page 324. That the legislature of Texas recognized this is revealed by another section of the statute. Article 7065a-8(d) declared that in the event of default, when it might become necessary for the state 'to bring suit or to intervene ... for the establishment or collection' of its claims in judicial proceedings, the tax reports required of the distributor by other provisions of the statute7 should be 'prima facie evidence of the contents thereof,' but 'the incorrectness of said report or audit may be shown.' Thus it was clearly envisaged that the amount of the taxes due, for which the lien was security, should be left to determination by the courts.\n As to the nature of the proper procedure for levy, seizure, and sale, it is enough to say that some procedure is essential. As we have indicated, the statutory scheme reveals that the legislature contemplated resort to the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 480, 488]\n\u00a0\n courts. In addition to the statutory provisions referred to above, Article 7065a-8(e) regulates the pleadings in suits by the Attorney General to collect the tax, and Article 7065a-9 determines the venue of such suits. Consequently, while it was clearly intended by Article 7065a-7 to create a lien in favor of the state, we must conclude that of necessity it was nothing more than an inchoate and general lien. Certainly it did not of its own force divest the taxpayer of either title or possession. It could not become specific until the exact amount of the taxes due had been determined, and it could not be enforced without the assistance of the courts. Like the tax lien in New York v. Maclay, supra, it served 'merely as a caveat of a more perfect lien to come.' 288 U.S. at page 294, 53 S.Ct. at page 324.\n We are not now called upon to decide whether the chattel mortgages held by Dailey are entitled to priority over the claim of the United States. \n8\n We hold only that the tax claim of the United States is entitled to priority over the tax claim of Texas. The case is remanded to the Court of Civil Appeals for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.Rev.Stat.  3466, U.S.C., Title 31, Section 191, 31 U.S.C.A.  191 provides: 'Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n314 \nU.S. 423\n, 62 S.Ct. 317, 86 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The full text of the paragraph, as of Nov. 20, 1933, when the receiver was appointed read: 'All taxes, fines, penalties and interest due by any distributor to the State shall be a preferred lien, first and prior to any and all other existing liens, upon all of the property of any distributor, devoted to or used in his business as a distributor, which property shall include refinery, blending plants, storage tanks, warehouses, office buildings and equipment, tank trucks or other motor vehicles, or any other property devoted to such use, and each tract of land on which such refinery, blending plant, tanks or other property is located, or which is used in carrying on such business.'

That city and Kansas City, Missouri, are both part \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n of a district known as Greater Kansas City, which for over three-quarters of a century had been served by a produce market located in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1937 the Union Pacific Railroad, acting upon the suggestion of two promoters, DeOreo and Fean, formulated a plan for the construction of a new market in Kansas City, Kansas. The Union Pacific in turn induced the City of Kansas City, Kansas, to undertake the development of such a market, which the City was to construct, operate and own. Union Pacific became interested in the development in order to increase the volume of its traffic; for unlike the situation in the Missouri market it was, with a minor exception, the only railroad with tracks serving the proposed Kansas site. Because business in the Greater Kansas City area was believed insufficient to support a split market, partly in Kansas and partly in Missouri, the plan included taking steps to persuade dealers on the Missouri side to move to Kansas. These negotiations will appear more fully below, but in general they contemplated certain concessions and free rents by the City of Kansas City, Kansas, to those dealers who decided to make the transfer. Ostensibly this was to compensate the dealers for their costs of removal, but actually, at least in some instances, it went somewhat beyond. Throughout the promotion, financing and leasing of the new market facilities, Union Pacific took a leading and dominant part. The market opened for operation on December 4, 1939\n\n\n On December 29, 1939, at the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Government filed a bill to enjoin the Union Pacific, the City of Kansas City, Kansas, certain of their officers and agents, and thirty-three produce dealers, from violating the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  1 et seq., 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and the Elkins Act, 49 U.S. C.  41-43, 49 U.S.C.A.  41-43, which prohibit rebates, concessions and discriminations in respect to the transportation of property by railroad \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce. \n1\n Under the provisions of section 3 of the Elkins Act,2 four other railroads and the City of Kansas \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n City, Missouri, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. The district court issued a temporary restraining order, held hearings, and on April 10, 1940, granted a temporary injunction. After further hearings a permanent injunction was entered on July 13. The appeal comes direct to this Court by virtue of the Expenditing Act, 49 U.S.C.  45, 49 U.S.C.A.  45, under section 238(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  345(1). 3 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n The facts set forth in the findings and opinion of the District Court, 32 F.Supp. 917, together with the supporting record references specified by the district judge, give a clear statement of the origin and development of the Kansas City, Kansas, project:\n Appellants DeOreo and Fean, before 1937, had promoted various metropolitan terminals with wholesale produce market and rail facilities. In December, 1936, they suggested to Union Pacific the feasibility of such a terminal to be served by its line at Greater Kansas City, and a plan was soon formulated for the construction of facilities on the Public Levee, property of Kansas City, Kansas; Union Pacific's aim was to increase its traffic and revenues from perishable food products. The plan contemplated that ownership of the terminal be vested in the City, which would be eligible for a PWA grant from the United States to cover part of the construction costs. A further consideration was that a city-owned market would be tax free, and thus able to offer dealers the inducement of especially low rentals. Union Pacific presented engineering and cost estimates to officials of the City of Kansas City, Kansas, who became interested in the project and determined that plans should go forward. Thereafter, Union Pacific and the City participated jointly in the promotion and financing of the terminal, and the court below found after a careful review of the evidence that Union Pacific took 'a leading and dominant part.' Union Pacific suggested the plan that financing be accomplished by a PWA grant and by revenue bonds of the City, secured only by revenue from the terminal and other levee property. Union Pacific suggested that the City make DeOreo and Fean exclusive leasing agents of the terminal for a period of ten years; when this contract was disapproved by PWA officials, the two promoters were persuaded to consent to its cancellation, and Union Pacific later causedsubstantial \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 456]\n\u00a0\n payments to be made to them by its subsidiary, the Kansas City Industrial Land Company. The City's first application for a PWA grant, which it prepared with Union Pacific's assistance, was denied, but a later application for $1,710,000 won approval in October, 1938. This supplied 45% of the cost of structures the City was to build; the remaining 55% was to be obtained by selling revenue bonds to investment bankers. Union Pacific helped the City secure state legislation authorizing the bonds; the bankers, however, declined to purchase them when Union Pacific refused to guarantee income sufficient to meet fixed charges. Union Pacific then decided to buy the bonds for itself, paying $3,000,000 plus accrued interest; $1,033,000 of this was used to retire outstanding revenue bonds, and the remainder made available for construction of the terminal. The bonds, which were held valid in State ex rel. Beck v. Kansas City, 149 Kan. 252, 86 P.2d 476, are secured solely by the revenues accruing from the terminal and other property on the Public Levee; they constitute no claim against the City's general revenues, and the district court found that they 'were and are speculative and were not then salable in the ordinary course of the commercial investment business.'\n Union Pacific also caused its officers, employees and agents, and those of its subsidiary, the Kansas City Industrial Land Company, and its affiliate, the Pacific Fruit Express Company, to render various ervices related to the promotional, leasing and financing activities; it advanced money for financing preliminary expenses; and together with the City it supervised the actual construction. The terminal as completed consists of railroad facilities, owned by Union Pacific, for which it spent $603,000; and the City's wholesale produce market, with a cold storage plant, produce dealers' buildings, a farmers' market, and some terminal trackage, all constructed with \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 457]\n\u00a0\n funds derived from the PWA grant and the revenue bonds sold to Union Pacific. \n4\n The Food Terminal is a unitary enterprise, with the market and the railroad facilities integral parts of a unified whole. Union Pacific has the only tracks reaching the terminal, except that the Missouri Pacific jointly serves the cold-storage plant.\n Active solicitation of the Missouri dealers to move to Kansas began in June, 1937. As early as August, 1937, Union Pacific contemplated the necessity of giving inducements to dealers, either by making direct payments or by buying from them 'unwanted properties.' In the summer and fall of that year, DeOreo and Fean induced five of the Missouri dealers to serve on a committee for the promotion of the Kansas terminal, agreeing to pay each of them $5000 'in consideration of the services rendered ... and the occupancy of the food terminal' as tenant. By August, 1938, Union Pacific's employees and agents had negotiated with other dealers with respect to cash payments and other inducements. As opposition developed on the Missouri side, the district court found that the campaign for enlistment of the Missouri dealers became 'open and intense.' Union Pacific, however, was anxious to avoid violating the Elkins Act, and sought the advice of its legal department, which rendered an opinion that payments made by the City to dealers would be lawful. With the assistance of a committee of prominent citizens, the City was persuaded to undertake such payments; in December, 1939, it passed Resolution 11275 authorizing use of the Public Levee Revenue Fund for settlements either with cash or credits on rental, or both, to cover costs incurred by prospective tenants, 'due to rental obligations on present places of business and costs due to abandonment of equipment and facilities \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 458]\n\u00a0\n now located in, and the good will of said established places of business.' The legality under state law of such payments by the City was promptly established in a test suit at least partially directed by Union Pacific. State ex rel. Parker v. Kansas City, 151 Kan. 1, 97 P.2d 104 and 151 Kan. 2, 98 P.2d 101.\n The City, although now willing to make payments to prospective tenants where necessary, was lacking funds. In arranging for refrigerator service at the market, Union Pacific contracted to buy its entire Kansas City and Omaha ice requirements from the City Ice & Fuel Company. This company leased the market's cold-storage unit for fifteen years at $37,500 per year; Union Pacific now urged the company to pay the City $80,000 as advance rent. The City Ice & Fuel Company did this and also, at Union Pacific's and the City's suggestion, deposited $25,000 with a bank as collateral for proposed unsecured and inadequately secured loans to Missouri produce dealers, although such loans, while offered, were never actually made.\n In the negotiations with the Missouri dealers, Union Pacific's representatives took an active part. The district court found that it and the City acted together to induce prospective tenants 'by means of offers, agreements, payments, and gifts to such defendant produce dealers and other produce dealers of free rents, reduced rents, free refrigeration, cash payments and rental credits purporting to be for the purpose of paying such produce dealers' cost of removal from Kansas City, Missouri ... and the value of furniture and fixtures in their Kansas City, Missouri, laces of business and the liability on unexpired leases in Kansas City, Missouri, but in some cases in excess of any such costs, values or liabilities.' The opinion adds that 'The testimony of several dealers with whom negotiations were conducted warrants the conclusion that the primary objective of those \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 459]\n\u00a0\n who conducted or took part in the negotiations was not the ascertainment of the loss or expense to the dealer of moving, but was the ascertainment of the amount necessary to be paid to bring about the move.' (32 F.Supp. 922.)\n The record fully supports the trial court's conclusion that the concessions offered were not confined to fair compensation for the costs of removal, as a brief review of the instances specified by the judge will show. Mallin Produce Company, the largest apple concern in the market, claimed $17,300 as its costs of removal, $7,300 for moving its apples, and $ 10,000 as the 'value of existing lease to be abandoned.' However, Mallin made no claim that he had any obligations under his Missouri lease;5 he merely said that he had been assured by his landlord that he could continue the lease as long as he lived, and that he would continue to lease the property 'in order to keep a competitor from securing it.' Union Pacific's representative nevertheless offered him $15,000 from the City, and then raised the offer to $20,000 when Mallin agreed to take two units instead of one at the terminal. The O. C. Evans, Company, which made no statement of the amount of its Missouri investment, was offered $5,000; when it demanded $10,000, the offer was increased to $7,000. The negotiators increased Cherrito's claim from $900 to $1,450 by raising the cost figures for his Missouri fixtures above the amounts he had specified. Garrett-Holmes & Company, which had claimed only about $20,000 in the summer of 1939 without presenting definite figures, in December demanded an adjustment of $35,000, and accepted $30,500 in cash and one year's free refrigeration. Settlement was reached on a claim for unexpired rentals of $ 15,000 and cost of irremovable business fixtures, $20,000. Litman Produce Company was given $15,000 in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 460]\n\u00a0\n case and advance rent after asserting an obligation to pay six years' rent on an unexpired Missouri lease, when in fact the lease was to expire in a few months and merely contained an option to renew for four years; Litman had not exercised the option, though after the injunction he entered into a new lease with his Missouri lessor. Robinson was allowed to put in a claim for $600 for several unexpired months of an asserted six months' lease, when the tenancy was in fact on a month-to-month basis. Winnick Brothers, a banana firm, was allowed more than $7,000 as the unamortized cost of fixtures and equipment that had apparently cost them less than a thousand dollars.\n The proposed cash payments to dealers totalled $111,000, and the proposed credits on rent more than $30,000. When negotiations with a dealer resulted in a tentative understanding or agreement, he would be told that Union Pacific could not pay him but that the matter would be submitted to the City. The district court's injunction intervened before more than one of the adjustments had been formally agreed to by the City Board and none of these payments had actually been made.\n In addition to these circumstances, the standard form lease contained express provisions for free rents and reduced rents. The standard rental adopted was $150 per month per unit, but for the first three months after the official completion date only $50 was charged. Moreover, the terminal opened for business on December 4, 1939; dealers began moving in then and enjoyed rent-free occupation until February 1, 1940, which was announced as the official completion date.\n Union Pacific also made available a certain amount of free advertising by interviewing the terminal's tenant on its radio program and allowing them to describe the kind and quality of their produce.\n Throughout all phases of these activities, Union Pacific's principal and compelling motive has been to divert produce \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 461]\n\u00a0\n traffic from other railroads to its own. By tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, charges for handling are collected by the Union Pacific for cars originating on or destined to other lines. If the market shifts from Missouri to Kansas, it is estimated that Union Pacific stands to gain traffic revenues of several hundred thousand dollars annually from the development of the market, due largely to the fact that a railroad on whose line a shipper is located enjoys a substantial advantage in soliciting competitive traffic, and comparable losses may be reasonably expected by the railroads now serving the Missouri market.\n The Applicable Statutes. The Elkins Act is a part of the federal statutory system for the regulation of interstate carriers of commerce. As with other portions of that system a chief purpose for its enactment was to eliminate rebates, concessions or discriminations from the handling of commerce, to the end that persons and places might carry on their activities on an equal basis. With the adoption of prohibition against open rate cutting, various devices were resorted to.6 The railroads sought control over competitors to escape rate wars and, despite abhorrence of monopolies even in the utility field, strong in the early years of this century, such concentrations of carrier control were thought to have one advantage at least, the reduction of discriminatory practices. \n7\n Concealment of the receipt or payment of rebates was made manifest. Strengthening of the enforcement provisions was sought. This effort finally culminated in the legislative authorization of the injunction as the simplest and most summary legal instrument to destroy discrimination. \n8\n The courts have found the statutes effective to accomplish the destruction \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 462]\n\u00a0\n of discriminatory practices, whatever their form. Violation of the commerce acts through receipt of advantages is to be tested by actual results not by intention. \n9\n Any and all means to accomplish the prohibited end are banned. \n10\n We recently said that under competitive conditions existing in the New York area the action of the Commission in attacking discrimination by an order against furnishing non-transportation services below cost to the carrier was valid, although there was no showing that the charges were below fair value. \n11\n Contribution to a shipper's construction cost is forbidden. \n12\n In fact favoritism which destroys equality between shippers, however brought about, is not tolerated. Of course, no party to this appeal disputes this broad principle.\n Difficulties in statutory construction arise upon further analysis of the statute. Section 1, quoted in note 1, has a provision making it unlawful for any person to give or receive any concession in respect to transportation. A subsequent clause makes the act of giving or receiving a concession a misdemeanor and punishes its violation by 'every person or corporation, whether carrier or shipper.' Obviously a bonus paid by a railway to induce a prospective shipper to locate along its line would be as much a concession under the statute as a reduction in tariff applicable only to the favored shipper. We are of the opinion that such a payment by a person who is not a carrier, if it is a payment 'in respect to ... transportat on,' would be equally violative of the section in question.\n The first prohibition makes it unlawful 'for any person ... or corporation' to give or receive the concession. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 463]\n\u00a0\n The appellants' argument that only carriers or shippers are covered is based on the clause stating the punishment to be applicable whether the alleged violator is 'carrier or shipper.' Such an argument assumes that the carrier and shipper clause restricts the ordinary meaning of 'any person.' No reason is advanced for such a restriction. As has been set out, there has been a well defined and continuous purpose to eliminate preferences to shippers from our system of transportation for reasons of fairness and to avoid rate wars, detrimental to the efficiency of the carriers. The words stressed by appellants as restrictive were added by the Hepburn Act as an amendment to Section 1 of the Elkins Act to make clear that the earlier phrase 'any person, persons, or corporation' included shippers as well as carriers. \n13\n In our view, action by any person to bring about discriminations in respect to the transportation of property is rendered unlawful by the Elkins Act. Any other conclusion would do violence to a dominant purpose of carrier legislation.\n This conclusion is buttressed by other language in the Elkins Act and by decisions in other courts which have dealt with the question. Section 3 authorizes such suits as this against a carrier and such other persons 'as the court may deem necessary' when a carrier is 'committing any discriminations' and the court may enforce its orders 'as well against the parties interested in the traffic' as against the carrier. For example, in Spencer Kellogg & Sons v. United States, 2 Cir., 20 F.2d 459, a grain elevator owner, without carrier affiliation or cooperation, was convicted for sharing its allowance for elevation service with a shipper. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 464]\n\u00a0\n The statute specifically requires that the concession given or received shall be 'in respect to the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce by any common carrier.' As the language of the section covers indisputably the carrier and the freight involved in movement into and out of a metropolitan terminal market,15 only the phrase 'in respect to the transportation' requires analysis. What has been said shows its meaning connotes more than discrimination in payment of tariffs. Offering or soliciting the concessions explicitly violates the section. So does a building bonus granted on condition that the favored industry use the carrier's facilities. \n16\n The concessions are none the less illegal, if made for non-transportation services,17 as long as they result in lowering directly or indirectly transportation costs to a shipper. That other inducements may also have influenced the concessions is not important when a materially effective purpose is the securing of traffic for an interstate carrier. Where traffic is an object and discriminatory advantage the means employed in attempting to obtain or actually obtaining it, there is a violation of the section in respect to transportation.\n Validity of the Plan. Appellants urge that the City's action in making rrangements for payments to dealers located in the Missouri city was taken solely in furtherance of its municipal interests and without intention to influence traffic and consequently not 'in respect to the transportation of any property.' It is pointed out that it is quite permissible and indeed desirable for a railroad, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 465]\n\u00a0\n largely dependent as its prosperity is upon the prosperity of the communities reached by its tracks, to take part in furthering civic development. Certainly there can be no objection on the score of illegality under federal transportation acts for a city, anxious to make its market house profitable, to adopt business practices, normal for real estate operators, if the practices do not involve discriminations 'in respect to ... transportation' by interstate carriers. Thus it is understandable that city and railroad might individually and even cooperatively work hand in hand to promote the city's economic welfare without violating the Elkins Act. But the promotion of civic advancement may not be used as a cloak to screen the granting of discriminatory advantages to shippers. Consequently in the present case the things done are to be appraised by the standards of the statutes, heretofore examined. For this purpose we may lay aside as of small importance the action of the Union Pacific in advancing funds for the expenses of an inspection tour to other cities by the Missouri merchants who were thus made familiar with markets similar to the proposed market on the Kansas side of the Missouri River. The use of the railroad's radio time to advertise shippers' available stock in trade, while unlawful, seems too minor for further comment in a suit to enjoin discriminations through cash bonuses and free rent. Further, while it would be a violation of the Elkins Act for a carrier to offer a shipper a concession to be paid to the shipper by a non- carrier, we do not find it necessary to rest the decision here upon the carrier's alleged action in offering payments to shippers by the City. For in this case invalidity of the carrier's action would follow a fortiori from the invalidity of the City's action. Therefore we examine the City's situation.\n Enough has heretofore been stated to support fully the conclusion that some shippers obtained agreements from \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 466]\n\u00a0\n the City committee on negotiations for concessions in return for moving into the new market. In determining whether the concessions were in respect to transportation, the cooperative functioning of railway and City, transportation and municipal officers become significant. The phrase 'in respect to ... transportation' has not a technical connotation. It differs from intent or purpose to affect transportation. It is broader than 'in reduction of tariffs' though, as appears from the act, it is such a discrimination as results in transportation 'at a less rate than that named in the tariffs ... or whereby any other advantage is given ....' Our attention is not called to any legislative history as to the purpose of the inclusion of the words in the Elkins Act or as to their meaning. We have found none. We are of the view that the phrase limits the 'rebate, concession, or discrimination' to advantages or disadvantages in transportation but has no further effect. As the discrimination is limited to transportation matters, normally one would find involved in the discrimination not only a user or prospective user of the facilities of the carrier but also the carrier itself. This is true in this instance. Carrier and City, through a committee of employees of each and through DeOreo and Fean and their aides, worked together to bring into the terminal tenants whose business as found below was 'shipping into and out of the Food Terminal products transported in interstate commerce upon which the dealers pay the freight.' Where concessions are offered to such dealers by the City in a plan worked out cooperatively by the City and carrier, as here, these concessions are necessarily in respect to transportation. The Union Paci ic is charged with the public duty of and is interested in transportation. The promoters brought the scheme for the market first to the railway company. It was impressed with the possibilities and worked earnestly to convince first a few city officials and then the Board of the desirability of action \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 467]\n\u00a0\n by the City. Money for the preliminary expenses was advanced by the Union Pacific. No objection was made to the use by the City of prepaid rents from the City Ice & Fuel Company to further the removal of the dealers in the manner 'conceived and devised,' in the words of a finding, by the Union Pacific. The railroad was the 'leading and dominant' influence in the entire transaction. If the City was not completely 'subservient to the competitive needs' of the carrier, as we said of the warehousing corporations in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 507, 516\n, 517 S., 59 S.Ct. 284, 287, at least the encouragement and cooperation given by the railroad was of a kind to make it plain that the City's action looked specifically towards gaining traffic for the road. While, as has been stated, it is the result and not the purpose which determines the illegal character of advantages granted shippers, when there is a purpose or plan for securing traffic, developed cooperatively by a carrier and others, the purpose makes clear that the concessions offered are in respect to transportation.\n The power of the City to make the concessions and the question of whether any money to be used by the City was contributed directly or indirectly by the Union Pacific do not affect this conclusion. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas in State ex rel. Parker v. Kansas City,18 that the City, in its proprietary capacity, under Kansas law has 'authority to pay such sums as are necessary ... to carry out ... such policies and transactions as may be to the best interest of said City in securing tenants ... for said Terminal' is not reviewable here. But the opinions in these Kansas cases do not consider or decide whether the proposed payments are a part of a plan to grant advantages to shippers contrary to the Elkins Act. Even if the City's action had \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 468]\n\u00a0\n been discussed from that standpoint, the result would not conclude this Court. It is our duty to determine finally the effect of acts or plans plainly under that federal statute. \n19\n It is impossible, and in our view immaterial, to determine from the evidence and findings whether the Union Pacific contributed indirectly to the fund for making payments to shippers. The railroad owned a three million dollar bond issue which carries a covenant to apply all revenues of the properties involved, after operating expenses, to the bond liquidation. By acquiescing in the application of the revenues to secure tenants, the railway did contribute financially, if there was a failure to earn enough to meet expenses. The estimates as to earnings are necessarily uncertain. From its finding that the projected net return was compensatory, the district court was apparently of the view that the Terminal would pay out. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 469]\n\u00a0\n Injunction. One provision of the permanent injunction entered by the district court enjoined the Union Pacific and Kansas City, Kansas, and their officers or agents from giving cash or rental credits to produce dealers to move into or remain in quarters in the Kansas City Food Terminal. \n21\n The appellants assign as error the action of the district court in entering any prohibition against payments 'in such amounts as its ( the City's) governing body may determine' and 'against use of its Public Levee revenues' for the payment of 'damages sustained by produce dealers moving' to the Terminal.\n Resolution 11275 was construed by the Supreme Court of Kansas to authorize disbursements of available market funds for such purposes 'as in the judgment of said governing body will be to the best interest(s) of ( the) city.' \n22\n By the resolution these expenditures were limited to the dealers' actual costs of removal, including loss of good will.\n In prior sections of this opinion, it has been pointed out that any concession by any person or corporation in respect to transportation is forbidden by the federal transportation statutes. The paragraph of the injunction now \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 470]\n\u00a0\n under examination undertakes to apply this rule so that no cash payments or rental credits may be given. It is clear that in so far as such cash or credit is a 'rebate, concession, or discrimination' such an injunction is proper, but do all payments to induce dealers to rent space in the Terminal fall in these classifications? The trial court said, 'The proposed payments to Missouri dealers to induce them to move to the new market not being made to all tenants at the new market and being in the nature of bonuses the amount of which was not based on actual loss or expense, fall within the classification of discriminations prohibited by the Elkins Act.'\n The words of the injunction, however, go farther and forbid payments even though the payments are in all fairness and strictness limited to actual and necessary expenses and losses in moving an establishment. Consequently, in deciding the form of the injunction, we need to determine the breadth of language necessary 'to suppress the unlawful practices' and preclude their revival. \n23\n The district court summarized in findings of fact and conclusions of law the constant activity of the Union Pacific in pressing forward the idea of the Terminal. It has before it the testimony that the road sought, meticulously, to avoid conflict wit the Elkins Act and yet gain the installation of the market; that the railway representatives acted with the City committees and talked with prospective tenants. Railroad influence pervaded each City action and in those circumstances, the decree must be molded to meet the danger of subtle moves against the equality between shippers guaranteed by the Elkins Act.\n Where, as here, the action of the City in giving cash and rental credits is, as we have decided, a part of a plan in re- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 471]\n\u00a0\n spect to transportation resulting in an advantage to shippers, we conclude that the giving of any cash, rental credit, free or reduced rents to induce leasing of space in the Terminal is contrary to the Elkins Act. Even if we assume that nothing will be given except the actual costs of removal, the receipt of those costs would put the shipper in a preferred position to all other shippers using the facilities of an interstate carrier who did not receive such concessions. The act condemns any device 'whereby any other advantage (than lower tariffs) is given ....' The wording of paragraph (1) is approved.\n Another prohibition of the injunction determines that the rates for space shall be such 'which will yield a proper rate of return upon the full value of the market facilities as a whole, after making provision for all expenses of operation, including maintenance and depreciation.' \n24\n Identical language in paragraph Third (2) of the injunc- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 472]\n\u00a0\n tion forbids produce dealers, of whom many were parties to this proceeding, and their agents from being tenants of the Terminal at rental rates which are not adequate to yield the required amount. The inclusion of this requirement is in our opinion erroneous. The words quoted in the text should be stricken and the injunction amended by inserting in lieu of the stricken words the following: 'which is a fair rental value for the facilities occupied.' The reasons for the deletion follow.\n The preliminary injunction referred to in the excerpt from the final injunction quoted in note 24 set the rentals at not less than certain definite amounts per month and per annum for operating units and office space. There were allowances for uncompleted facilities not now important. No issue is raised here as to whether the sums fixed were or were not a fair rental value. Adequate findings determined the values of the facilities, the estimated gross and net revenues and rates of return. W th these findings before it, the district court further found in its final order that the rates fixed in the preliminary injunction were compensatory and did not amount 'to a gift of any part of the value of the use of the Food Terminal to the tenant shippers.' 25 This result is not \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 473]\n\u00a0\n questioned. It may therefore be concluded that this scale of charges meets the requirements of the decree for aggregate rates which do not amount to concessions. Since the adequacy of these rates was reached in considering the full value of the properties, including the land furnished by the City and the grant from the Public Works Administration, it may be assumed that they are not less than a fair rental value. The last paragraph of the order provides a method for modification by application to the court should either side be of opinion that this assumption is incorrect. As will immediately appear from this opinion, it is unnecessary to give consideration to the contention that the district court erred in adding the value of the City's land and the amount of the grant to the cost of the facilities. If the correct test is fair rental value, cost of facility is only persuasive, not determinative. Consequently it may be shown as a material factor in determining the fair rental value of the properties but the rates are not required to be upon a level which will give a return upon the value of the investment as a whole.\n Fair rental value rather than a compensatory return upon full value of the market facilities is the standard by which the City's schedule of rates is to be judged. To determine fair rental value the going rates of rental for similar facilities in the community are significant, as are the rentals prospective tenants are willing to pay. Likewise evi- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 474]\n\u00a0\n dence of the overall cost and the overall value of the properties would be material. The cost of furnishing the facilities, including the normal return on capital employed in like enterprises would have weight. Other pertinent factors would doubtless emerge in a controversy to have determined judicially, whether certain rentals received are or are not fair. When enough evidence is offered to justify a conclusion based upon judgment amd not guesswork, the requirements of the judicial process are met. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n This is not the case for a rigid rule that aggregate rentals are to equal costs, such as was applied i Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 507, 523\n, 524 S., 59 S.Ct. 284, 290, where this Court approved an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission designed to root out competitive evils in discriminatory warehousing indulged in by carriers in an effort to acquire traffic. The City is entitled to develop its properties and location in accordance with the laws of Kansas for civic advantage, so long as it does not utilize its facilities in furtherance of a scheme to obtain customers for a carrier by the offering of concessions, contrary to the Elkins Act. It was recognized in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States that a charge of fair rental value for services accessorial to transportation would adequately protect even a carrier under proper circumstances. We are of the view that rental charges fixed upon that concept will avoid the discriminatory evils proscribed by the Elkins Act.\n With the modifications directed in this opinion, the order of the district court is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 475]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I cannot agree with the judgment in this case. In last analysis the question presented is whether the Elkins Act proscribes financial transactions by a city with proposed occupants of a city-owned building because those occupants will be shippers in interstate commerce from such building, where the city is to furnish no facilities or services of transportation, where the transactions involve no payments, concessions or discriminations on the part of any interstate carrier, are authorized by State law and are for the city's benefit. A subsidiary question is whether in fact the proposed transactions amount to discriminations in favor of such occupants. A further question is presented with respect to the decree to be entered.\n I find it unnecessary to discuss the evidence in detail, or narrowly to examine the findings. I shall endeavor, for the purpose of reaching the legal questions, to consider the case in the light most favorable to the appellees.\n The defendants De Oreo and Fean are not philanthropists but promoters who had more or less successfully promoted produce terminals in various cities. They conceived the plan of establishing one in Kansas City, Kansas. They expected a profit out of the venture. Their original idea was that they should become lessees of the terminal and make their profit by subrenting space in it. When this purpose was abandoned they sought to be made exclusive rental agents. Objection by the P.W.A. rendered this proposal impracticable. They have received considerable payments from Union Pacific for their efforts in connection with the establishment of the terminal.\n De Oreo and Fean presented their plan to Union Pacific. That company took an interest, not eleemosynary but practical, in the project. Inasmuch as its tracks would serve the proposed terminal the railroad naturally desired that the plan go through so that it might get in- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 476]\n\u00a0\n creased business and obtain a competitive advantage over other railroads serving the area known as Greater Kansas City and particularly the food terminal at Kansas City, Missouri. But the railroad did not desire to erect the terminal. It sought to interest the officials of Kansas City, Kansas, in the scheme, and succeeded in doing so.\n Some years ago Kansas City, Kansas, had been given a large tract of water front land which, until recently, had been unused. Through a P.W.A. grant and a loan from Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the city had made some improvements and had erected a grain elevator and docks on the tract which were served by the lines of Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific. The balance of the tract was available for a produce terminal. The establishment of such an instrumentality would obviously be of great benefit to the city in both financial and civic aspects. The plan evolved was that the city should erect such a terminal; that Union Pacific would construct a arge team track and switching yard on the ground adjacent to the terminal to be leased by Union Pacific from the city and that the terminal should be financed by the city through a P.W.A. grant and income bonds.\n De Oreo and Fean, Union Pacific, and the city officials all struggled earnestly to obtain a grant from P.W.A. An investigation by the Department of Agriculture disclosed that the terminal would be highly beneficial to the producers tributary to the Kansas City market. Investigation by the P. W.A. disclosed that the scheme was desirable and practicable. A grant of not to exceed $1,700,000 was made conditioned on the financing of the remainder of the project.\n Union Pacific and the city officials negotiated with an underwriting house for the sale, by the city, of $3,000,000 of income bonds, $1,033,000 of which were to be used to pay off the outstanding bonds, and the balance for the erection of the terminal. Although a firm commitment \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 477]\n\u00a0\n had been obtained the bond house, at the last moment, receded from the proposition thus leaving the whole project in jeopardy. In this situation Union Pacific asserted its willingness to buy the bonds. A bidding was held and Union Pacific was the successful bidder. No question is made of the legality of this investment by the railroad, and its intention to take the bond issue was approved by P.W.A. and was certified to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The city had no power to pledge its property and its general revenues as security for the bonds. It had full authority to issue income bonds, interest, and principal to be paid from the receipts of the terminal. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The condition precedent to the P.W.A. grant having been fulfilled, the city proceeded with the erection of the terminal with the fullest aid and cooperation of Union Pacific. That company had advanced some $22,000 for preliminary expenses, which the city proposed to repay it. Under a ruling of P.W.A. the city could not do so with funds procured for construction and if the sum is repaid, the funds must come out of income. The railroad, not unnaturally, retained an architect to collaborate with the city's architect respecting the construction and exerted every effort to bring the plan to fruition.\n In Kansas City, Missouri, there was an existing wholesale produce market. This needed extensive alterations and additions and the expectation was that many of the tenants would move to the new and more convenient terminal in Kansas City, Kansas. All who were interested in the latter realized that tenants of the old one in Missouri might incur expense in giving up their quarters and moving to the new. They realized also that, in order promptly to fill the new building, some concessions in \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 478]\n\u00a0\n the amount of early-accruing rentals might have to be made. An ice manufacturing and cold storage plant was part of the project. A tenant was obtained for this unit at a substantial rental. The city authorities negotiated an arrangement with the tenant for payment of some $80,000 in advance rental. With this money, and other advance rents it might obtain, the city felt that it could arrange to reimburse persons who might become tenants for losses incident to their removal. The question arose, however, as to the city's authority so to do. The matter was referred to a committee of lawyers and ultimately to the Attorney General of Kansas. That officer thought the matter should be settled by court decision. Accordingly a proceeding was instituted in the Supreme Court of Kansas and that court held the city had power, in the circumstances, to use advance rents in the manner proposed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n As was expected, tenants of the old market in Missouri, when solicited to move to the new, raised questions of losses due to unexpired leases, abandonment of fixtures, etc. Everybody interested in the new terminal, including De Oreo and Fean, employes of Union Pacific, and representatives of the city, negotiated with these prospective tenants with respect of what would be a fair recompense for their losses due to removal and reestablishment. None of these negotiators had authority to do more than ascertain the claims of such proposed tenants which were to be submitted to, and adjusted by, a committee representing and acting for Kansas City, Kansas. The evidence is uncontradicted and overwhelming that Union Pacific's employes, and everyone else concerned, made it clear that any adjustment of these losses would have to be made by the city, and by the city only; that the railroad could not, and would not, pay a cent towards any such expense. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 479]\n\u00a0\n When this suit was brought nothing had been paid to any claimant. One claim had been approved by the committee. It turns out that although that claim was supported by affidavit it was in an unjustifiably large amount with respect to the cancellation of an existing lease but there is no evidence that the city officials, in approving the claim, knew this or would have approved the claim had they known it, and there is no finding that the claim was made in bad faith. Moreover, neither with respect to this claim nor to any other which was under consideration at the time suit was instituted is there evidence, and there is no finding by the court below or by this court, except by innuendo, that if the claims made were paid any payee would have even been made whole for losses consequent on moving and establishing himself in the new location, or that he would thereby have had any preference or advantage over other tenants to whom no such payments were made.\n At an early day in the development of the project Union Pacific expressed its willingness to switch all consignments in and out of the terminal to and from other railroads at a uniform and fair charge. It filed a switching tariff with the Interstate Commerce Commission which has been accepted and is concurred in by the other railroads. The tariff is the same as that which has been in force for similar service in Kansas City, Missouri. Thus all railroads and shippers are to be served indifferently and at a uniform and fair rate for the transportation services involved.\n On these facts the question is whether the actions of the railroad, those of the city, or those of the two jointly, constitute a rebate or a discrimination within the meaning of the Elkins Act. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nIt has always been understood that one of the purposes of the interstate commerce law was to prevent a \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 480]\n\u00a0\n carrier from giving, and a shipper from receiving, transportation services at less than the published tariff rates, and to preclude what is equivalent, namely, the furnishing of a service at tariff rates to one shipper which is withheld from others. The sections of the Elkins Act here relied upon were merely intended to implement this Congressional aim and more efficiently to provide against evasion. Thus it is made unlawful for any person or corporation to offer, to grant, to give, or to solicit, to accept, or to receive, any rebate, concession or discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate commerce by any common carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., whereby any such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than the published tariff rate, or whereby any other advantage is given or discrimination is practiced. The language seems too clear to be misunderstood. It is only the carrier, or someone acting in its behalf, who can give or grant a concession. It is only the shipper, or someone acting in his behalf, who can receive or solicit one. The section as originally enacted, 32 Stat. 847, goes on to provide: 'Every person or corporation who shall offer, grant, or give or solicit, accept or receive any such rebates, concession, or discrimination' shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by fine. As a ended, it imposes a further punishment by fine or imprisonment upon any officer of a corporation or any person 'acting for or employed by' any corporation, who is convicted of violating the provisions of the Act. Until the present time no one has supposed that a third party who is neither carrier nor shipper and neither furnishes nor receives transportation service, in making a business deal with a man who happens to be a shipper over an interstate carrier's line, may render himself liable criminally if, and merely because, the result of his transaction will be beneficial when reckoned up in the year's profit and loss statement of the other party to the transaction. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 481]\n\u00a0\n There seems to have been some question, although it is hard to understand why, whether the penal provisions of the Act applied to a shipper or his agents. When the Act was amended by the Hepburn Act the phrase 'every person or corporation' was supplemented by an epexegetical clause 'whether carrier or shipper'. The legislative record shows that the amendment was intended to make sure that shippers who received rebates should be guilty equally with carriers who gave them. It had no other purpose.\n Every decision applying the relevant provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and the Elkins Act has turned upon the fact that someone furnishing a service of transportation covered by a tariff has remitted a part of the tariff charge, or has rendered a free service, or a service below cost to some shippers which others did not enjoy; and where one not a carrier has been held guilty of a violation of the Act it has been because he returned to the shipper through one performing a part of the transportation service covered by the carrier's tariff part of the published rate or has induced the carrier to perform a service for the shipper covered by the tariff at less than the published rate, or has induced the carrier to perform a transportation service for a shipper to which the shipper was not entitled under the published tariff and which, therefore, the carrier failed to perform for others.\n The District Court, sensible of this unbroken line of authority, thought it necessary to attribute the proposed payments in some way to Union Pacific. To reach this result, it held that in the terminal enterprise Union Pacific and Kansas City were joint adventurers. Obviously the conclusion is incorrect. Union Pacific was in no sense a partner and did not stand to make a profit from the conduct of the enterprise. It was a lessee of a part of the property for its frieght yard at an adequate rental. It \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 482]\n\u00a0\n was the owner of bonds lawfully acquired, and, as such, dealt at arm's length with the city. Although the Government seeks to sustain the conclusion of the District Court this court apparently discards it as unjustifiable.\n In the second place, the District Court held that Union Pacific and the city were in a conspiracy to grant compensation to prospective tenants. But this is not equivalent to finding that the purpose of the conspiracy was to grant transportation to these tenants at less than the tariff rates of Union Pacific. Inasmuch as it is conceded that there was no purpose to grant any shipper any service not granted to others, or to give any shipper a rebate from the published tariff rates, it seems plain that the latter sort of conspiracy is not made out.\n Finally, the District Court sought to spell out a financial contribution by Union Pacific for the benefit of proposed tenants by what it denominated the waiver of the lien of the bonds held by the railroad on the terminal property. An examination of the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas4 makes it clear that, under the law of that State, the railroad had no lien, in any proper sense of the term. The state court held that the obligation of the city under the bonds was to devote the net profits of the enterprise to the payment of the principal and interest, but that it was at liberty to pay all necessary operating expenses, including he expenses of obtaining tenants. I do not understand that the opinion of this court approves the finding and conclusion of the District Court in this respect.\n The ruling here is much broader, and does not condition violation of the law on any payment or concession by Union Pacific. It is that if the city, which is not a shipper, nor a carrier, and not a furnisher of any transportation service, in dealing with its own property not \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 483]\n\u00a0\n devoted to any service of transportation, sees fit to make an advantageous financial arrangement with a proposed tenant of its property that transaction, otherwise legal, at once becomes illegal and subjects the city, or its officers, to criminal penalties and to an injunction if it happens that the party with whom it deals becomes, in virtue of the transaction, a shipper over the lines of an interstate carrier, and is benefited by the transaction. The distinction sought to be made between benefits applicable to transportation and benefits generally seems to me illusory. The court expressly holds that intent is immaterial; that if the result is advantageous to the shipper a rebate, concession, or discrimination from the tariffs of the carrier has been accomplished within the meaning of the Elkins Act.\n I venture to think that no one will be more surprised than the members of the Congress at the attribution to the statutory phrase 'every person' who gives or receives, grants or solicits rebates or discriminatory service to states and municipal corporations and their officers who, in promoting lawful municipal purposes, incidentally bring additional business to an interstate carrier. We know that it is a common practice for chambers of commerce and city authorities to offer to manufacturing and business concerns lands and sites on favorable terms, such as low purchase price, reduced rentals, exemption from taxation for a given period, in an effort to induce such concerns to locate within the limits of a municipality.\n We know that, in order to induce men to move their plants from one location to another, it is a practical necessity to offer them some recompense for the expense involved and for the loss which may result from doing business in a new location. Under the decision now announced, citizens or city officials connected with such a transaction, though their purpose be wholly remote from any benefit to a railroad, are guilty of a criminal offense. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 484]\n\u00a0\n We also know that in the competitive effort of railroads to obtain business they have assisted municipalities to establish industries along their lines. It has never been thought that such activity on the part of the railroad, where it gave nothing in money and rebated nothing from its published tariffs in service or rates, constituted a violation of the Elkins Act. To hold that, by this statute, Congress intended to paralyze lawful effort, well within the powers conferred by the states on their municipalities, in the view that such effort constitutes a rebate from a carrier's tariff rate, seems to me to place a forced and unreasonable construction upon the words of the Act.\n The opinions of the court below and of this court point out that, as a result of the consummation of the plan for a terminal, Union Pacific expected to carry greatly increased traffic into and out of Kansas City and that this increase necessarily would inflict losses upon its competitors. But the Elkins Act and the Interstate Commerce Act, were aimed at specific abuses, and were not general prohibitions of all forms of competition between carriers or limitations on the increase of a carrier's traffic by any sort of competition. In fact the Congressional policy is to foster and encourage competition between railroads, and to prohibit agreements or conspiracies to suppress it. \n5\n It is common knowledge that carriers customarily advertise the advantages of sites lying along their lines in the hope of encouraging shippers to locate thereon. It seems to me that the circumstanc so pointedly noticed is irrelevant to any question involved in this case. Of course, Union Pacific was actuated by the legitimate desire of increased traffic in all its efforts towards the establishment of the terminal. That avowed motive was, in my judgment, innocent and lawful. Moreover, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 485]\n\u00a0\n in truth, this controversy has its roots in the competition of two cities, rather than that of railroads.\n\n 2. \nAssuming, as the opinion does, that the city and its officers were, within the meaning of the Act, persons 'acting for' Union Pacific, the proof fails to disclose that the sum proposed to be paid to any produce merchant in connection with his moving to the new terminal was in fact more than fair compensation for loss or was a discrimination against any other tenant. There is no proof, and indeed it would be very difficult to furnish any, that at the end of one, two, or three years of business at the new terminal,-considering the attendant expense of moving and reestablishing the business at the new location, the incident loss of good will and custom, and the necessity of finding new custom to take the place of that lost,-the balance sheet of any of the tenants would disclose that he was better off than if he had stayed in his old location. And it would be even more difficult to determine that a sum paid him to cover such loss and damage is reflected upon his books in the transportation charges paid by him, rather than in the other items of expense connected with his business. How shall any such allocation be made? None such is necessary where the carrier itself, or someone representing it, grants a concession from the published rate or renders a service not comprehended in its tariff. In such case the fact speaks for itself. In this case the court assumes the fact and, by a blanket and sweeping decree, bans any compensation, however just, to anyone for removing from an old location to the new terminal on the suspicion that the payee may have some advantage over another tenant who did not incur any such expense. Thus the decree will render it impossible for Kansas City to make what it deems legitimate and proper arrangements for the prosecution of a business enterprise in no sense consisting of the service of transportation. It seems clear that Congress never had any such intent in adopting the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 486]\n\u00a0\n Elkins Act. This is to reach into the peculiarly local affairs of the states and to lay the dead hand upon the otherwise lawful activities of states and their subdivisions. Certainly a far more specific mandate should be required to persuade us that Congress had any such purpose.\n\n 3. \nAnother feature of the decree seems to me to be equally unjustified. The record discloses that the city adopted a standard form of lease which fixed a uniform rental per unit of space. In order to fill the building promptly this lease provided that for the first three months the monthly rental should be one-third of the standard monthly rental. Thus a tenant who, after the three months, would pay $150 a unit would get the use of that unit for the first three months for $50. It is again common knowledge that, in a competitive situation, the owner often has to make rental concessions for a brief time at the beginning of the lease term. There is nothing unlawful about this and the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas sanctions it. The court below swept aside all these arrangements and, although it found 'the present rental rates and the consequent return to the City are not so low that the use of the Food Terminal by tenants in interstate commerce at those rentals will amount to a gift of any part of the value of the use of the Food Terminal to the tenant shippers', it nevertheless required that the rentals must be such as to allow a fair return to the city on the total value of the premises including the product of the money granted by P.W.A. and the land acquired by free gift. Under the law, the city was at liberty to turn this land to account in such manner and at such rate of return as it might see fit. While the opinion of the court holds this provision of the decree erroneous, it substitutes what I think an equally improper rule. The city is to be prohibited from leasing its own publicly owned property, in the prosecution of an enterprise which it deems beneficial to the community, at rates it deems proper and rates \n\n[313 \nU.S. 450, 487]\n\u00a0\n which are otherwise within its lawful power. It is told that it must get a fair rental value and various criteria of fairness are suggested. Thus, the court holds, that Congress intended in such a situation to shackle the municipal arm of a sovereign state, for the indefinite future, and compel it to conduct its business contrary to what the law of its own state permits. This result cannot be justified in the guise of preventing an alleged rebate of tariff rates by a carrier unconnected with, and neither controlled by the city nor exerting any legal control over the city, whose only function is that of serving those who use the city's facilities.\n I am of opinion that the bill should have been dismissed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1(1) of the Elkins Act (32 Stat. 847; 34 Stat. 587; 49 U.S. C.  41(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  41(1)), so far as pertinent here, provides: 'Anything done or omitted to be done by a corporation common carrier, subject to chapter 1 of this title, which, if done or omitted to be done by any director or officer thereof, or any receiver, trustee, lessee, agent, or person acting for or employed by such corporat on, would constitute a misdemeanor under said chapter or under sections 41, 42, or 43 of this title, shall also be held to be a misdemeanor committed by such corporation, and upon conviction thereof it shall be subject to like penalties as are prescribed in said chapter or by sections 41, 42, or 43 of this title, with reference to such persons, except as such penalties are herein changed.

The City's estimate of operating expenses is unduly low by reason of the omission of any sums to cover the annual loss due to depreciation and obsolescence not made good by current maintenance.\n\n'The defendant City will derive no immediate direct financial benefit from the operation of the Kansas City Food Terminal. The Union Pacific, by reason of the anticipated improvement of the volume of its traffic in perishable produce and consequent increase in its revenues, will receive an immediate and continuing benefit from the project.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] This provision reads: '(1) From offering, granting, or giving, or assisting, joining, or cooperating in offering, granting, or giving cash payments or rental credits, free rents, and reduced rents, unsecured or inadequately secured loans constituting concessions, or other valuable considerations to defendant produce dealers or other produce dealers, or produce brokers or other persons, firms, or corporations shipping produce by railroad in interstate commerce to move or for moving to the Kansas City Food Terminal or for leasing space or remaining as tenants in said food terminal.' \n[\nFootnote 22\n] State ex rel.

Provided further that nothing contained in this decree shall be construed to limit the City in the renting of said facilities to a unit basis; but in no event shall the rates of rental and charges prescribed for such facilities aggregate less than is hereinabove provided.' \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] These ultimate findings are as follows:\n'41. The uniform or standard rates of rental adopted and approved by Kansas City, Kansas, for lease of warehouse space and office space at the Kansas City Food Terminal are $150.00 per month per unit and $1.10 per square foot per annum, respectively, and the average rate of rental adopted or approved by Kansas City, Kansas, for lease of the cold storage plant and appurtenant facilities at said Food Terminal is $38,497 per annum. Such rentals are intended to provide sufficient funds to amortize the principal and pay the interest on the Public Levee Revenue Bonds purchased by the defendant Union Pacific Railroad Company, representing 55 percent of the total cost of construction of the said Food Terminal, and to compensate the City for the use of the facilities for the purpose to which they are dedicated.\n\n'42. The net return, while low as compared to the fair return of many privately owned utilities devoted to the service of the public, is compensatory and, in view of the purpose of the City to bring about industrial improvement and the incidental advantage to the City for that purpose and the return generally obtained from investments in utilities of like or similar nature, the present rental rates and the consequent return to the City are not so low that the use of the Food Terminal by tenants in interstate commerce at those rentals will amount to a gift of any part of the value of the use of the Food Terminal to the tenant shippers.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Cf.

KREIDER CO.(1941)\nNo. 853\nArgued: May 7, 1941Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 443, 444]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Alexander Levene, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1921, respondent filed its income tax return for 1920, disclosing tax liability of $52,481.97 which it paid in full. Thereafter, and prior to June 15, 1926, it executed a waiver extending until December 31, 1926, the time for audit and possible additional assessment of taxes. On July 26, 1926, respondent paid a deficiency assessment of $1,362.50. Almost three years later, on March 23, 1929, respondent filed a claim for refund of $53, 844.47, the entire amount of taxes paid for 1920\n\n\n The Commissioner found that respondent had overpaid its 1920 taxes in the sum of $14,833.68. In October, 1929, he sent respondent a certificate of overassessment which noted that there had been an overpayment in that amount but that $13,471.18 was 'barred by statute of limitations'. Accompanying the certificate was a check for the difference, $1,362.50, which respondent apparently accepted. In thus computing the refund owing to respondent, the Commissioner assumed that subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), \n\n[313 \nU.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n and (g) of  2841 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 66, 67, 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 220, 222, authorized him to remit only that part of the 1920 tax which was paid in 1926.\n On March 7, 1932, respondent brought the present action in a United States District Court to recover the sum withheld. At the close of the trial, petitioner moved for judgment on the ground that the action was barred by  1113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 116, 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 324. The District Court granted the motion and entered judgment for petitioner. 30 F.Supp. 722. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting, holding that the general six-year limitation in  24(20) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C. A.  41(20) rather than the limitations in  1113(a) determined the timeliness of respondent's action. 3 Cir., 97 F. \n2\n 387.\n The cause was returned to the District Court. Over the renewed contention of petitioner that the action was barred by  1113(a), the District Court proceeded to the merits. It held, in effect, that  284(b)( 2) did not limit the refund sanctioned by  284(g) to the portion of the \n\n[313 \nU.S. 443, 446]\n\u00a0\n tax paid within four years of respondent's claim, and entered judgment as prayed in the complaint. 30 F.Supp. 724. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, accepting as the law of the case its earlier decision that the action was timely, despite petitioner's argument to the contrary. 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 133. On April 14, 1941, we granted certiorari. \n313 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S. Ct. 843, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Relying principally on Bonwit-Teller & Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 258\n, 51 S.Ct. 395, respondent maintains that its action was commenced well within the applicable period of limitation. Further, respondent contends that both courts below correctly refused to regard  284(b)(2) as a limitation on the Commissioner's duty to make refunds under  284(g). We find it unnecessary to examine the latter contention, for we are of opinion that respondent sued too late.\n Insofar as material here,  1113(a) provides: '... No (suit or proceeding for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected) shall be begun ... after the expiration of five years from the date of the payment of such tax ... unless such suit or proceeding is begun within two years after the disallowance of the part of such claim to which such suit or proceeding relates.'\n Undoubtedly, respondent has failed to begin its action within either of the periods specified in  1113(a). See A. S. Kreider Co. v. United States, 3 Cir., 97 F.2d 387, 388. The suit was not instituted until March 7, 1932, although the last tax payment was made on July 26, 1926, and the claim for refund was disallowed in October, 1929.2 But as al- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 443, 447]\n\u00a0\n ready stated, the court below held that the action was not barred because the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505), later incorporated in  24(20) of the Judicial Code, rather than  1113(a) prescribed the period within which respondent was bound to bring suit. We view the statutes differently.\n Section 24(20) gives the district courts jurisdiction concurrent with the court of claims of certain suits against the United States. To equate the right thus conferred to the existing right to sue in the court of claims (see 28 U.S.C.  262, 28 U.S.C.A.  262), the statute provides: 'No suit against the Government of the United States shall be allowed under this paragraph unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made.'\n We think the quoted language was intended merely to place an outside limit on the period within which all suits might be initiated under  24( 20). Clearly nothing in that language precludes the application of a different and shorter period of limitation to an individual class of actions even though they are brought under  24(20). Phrasing the condition negatively, Congress left it open to provide less liberally for particular ctions which, because of special consdierations, required different treatment. See Christie-Street Commission Co. v. United States, 8 Cir., 136 F. 326, 332, 333.\n Section 1113(a) is precisely that type of provision. Recognizing that suits against the United States for the recovery of taxes impeded effective administration of the revenue laws, Congress allowed only five years from payment of the tax for the commencement of such actions, unless specified circumstances extended the period. That this specific provision is entirely consistent with the general provision in  24(20) is plain. Indeed, the limita- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 443, 448]\n\u00a0\n tion in  1113(a) has no meaning whatever unless the limitation in  24(20) is construed not to govern proceedings for the recovery of 'internal- revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected'.3\n Bonwit-Teller & Co. v. United States, supra, does not remove the bar of  1113(a) here. There we held under the peculiar facts disclosed that the taxpayer could evade the limitations of that section by grounding its action on a subsequent 'account stated' rather than on the original, wrongful overassessment. But the instant case is plainly distinguishable, for, assuming that familiar doctrines of contracts furnish the test (Daube v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 367, 370\n, 53 S.Ct. 597, 598), we are unable to find the requisites of an account stated in the transactions on which respondent relies.\n To establish an account stated, respondent must show that a balance was struck 'in such circumstances as to import a promise of payment on the one side and acceptance on the other'. R. H. Stearns Co. v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 54, 65\n, 54 S.Ct. 325, 329; see also, Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 325; Nutt v. United States, \n125 \nU.S. 650\n, 8 S.Ct. 997. But plainly, 'no such promise is a just or reasonable inference from the certificate of overassessment delivered to this taxpayer, if the certificate is interpreted in the setting of the occasion.' R. H. Stearns Co. v. United States, supra. In fact, a contrary inference is the only legitimate supposition respondent could make. At most, respondent could assume that the United States prom- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n ised to pay $1,362.50; the check was there in fulfillment. Obviously, refusal to refund the balance did not and could not imply a promise by pay the amount withheld.\n Acceptance by respondent, another essential of an account stated, in equally lacking. By accepting the check for $1,362.50 respondent agreed only to a partial account stated (compare Sturm v. Boker, \n150 \nU.S. 312, 340\n, 14 S.Ct. 99, 108), thereby converting that much of the statement into an account settled. The institution of this suit is ample proof that respondent never intended to accept the certificate in its entirety as a correct computation of the amount which it claimed was due.\n We conclude that respondent's suit is barred by the limitations of  1113(a). The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the petition.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded, with directions. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 284. (a) Where there has been an overpayment of any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax imposed (by specified Acts), the amount of such overpayment shall (subject to enumerated conditions) ... be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.\n'(b) Except as provided in subdivisions ... (g) of this section-\n\n'(1) No such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after ... four years from the time the tax was paid in the case of a tax imposed by any prior Act, unless before the expiration of such period a claim therefor is filed by the taxpayer; and\n\n'(2) The amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the ... four years ... immediately preceding the filing of the claim. ...\n\n'(g) ... If the taxpayer has, on or before June 15, 1926, filed such a waiver in respect of the taxes due for the taxable year 1920 or 1921, then such credit or refund relating to the taxes for the taxable year 1920 or 1921 shall be allowed or made if claim therefor is filed either on or before April 1, 1927, or within four years from the time the tax was paid. ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It should be noted that this action seeks recovery of money which was paid in 1921. We assume, so far as this decision is concerned, that the phrase 'such tax' in the quoted language refers to the total tax for the year in question whenever determined and assessed; or stated differently, that 'payment' within the meaning of this statute does not occur until the entire tax for 1920 is paid, including deficiency assessments made several years later. Compare Union Trust Co. v. United States, 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 629.\n We assume also that the Commissioner's refusal in 1929 to make the refund was a 'disallowance' of respondent's claim. Compare Bonwit-Teller & Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 258, 265\n, 51 S.Ct. 395, 397, with United States .v Bertelsen & Peterson Engineering Co., \n306 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, 59 S.Ct. 541, 542. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Apparently the applicability of a specific limitation instead of the general Tucker Act limitation has not been challenged for 35 years.

Cox, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 602]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Luther Day, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondents. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 603]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We took this case because it presents the important question whether the United States may maintain an action for treble damages under  7 of the Sherman Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The complaint charged the respondents had illegally \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 604]\n\u00a0\n combined and conspired to fix collusive prices of articles purchased by the United States; alleged the money damage inflicted upon the United States thereby, and sought judgment for three times that amount. The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the United States is not a person as the term is used in  7 of the Sherman Act. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Section 7 provides:\n'Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three fold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.'\n\n The United States is a juristic person in the sense that it has capacity to sue upon contracts made with it or in vindication of its property rights. The Sherman Act, however, created new rights and remedies which are available only to those on whom they are conferred by the Act. \n4\n The precise question for decision, therefore, is whether, by the use of the phrase 'any person', Congress intended to confer upon the United States the right to maintain an action for treble damages against a violator of the Act.\n Since, in common usage, the term 'person' does not include the sovereign, statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it. \n5\n But there is no hard \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 605]\n\u00a0\n and fast rule of exclusion. The purpose, the subject matter, the context, the legislative history, and the executive interpretation of the statute are aids to construction which may indicate an intent, by the use of the term, to bring state or nation within the scope of the law. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Government admits that often the word 'person' is used in such a sense as not to include the sovereign but urges that where, as in the present instance, its wider application is consistent with, and tends to effectuate, the public policy evidenced by the statute, the term should be held to embrace the Government. And it strongly urges that all the considerations which moved Congress to confer the right to recover damages upon individuals and corporations injured by violations of the Act apply with equal force to the United States which, as a large procurer of goods and services, is as likely to be injured by the denounced combinations and monopolies as is a natural or corporate person. We are asked, in this view, so to construe the Act as not to deny to the Government what public policy is thought to require.\n Decision is not to be reached by a strict construction of the words of the Act, nor by the application of artificial canons of construction. On the contrary, we are to read the statutory language in its ordinary and natural sense, and if doubts remain, resolve them in the light, not only of the policy intended to be served by the enactment, but, as well, by all other available aids to construction. But it is not our function to engraft on a statute additions which we think the legislature logically might or should have made. 7 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 606]\n\u00a0\n The recent expressions of this court in Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141, 148\n, 149 S., 60 S.Ct. 879, 882, 883, 130 A.L.R. 1321, warn that it is not for the courts to indulge in the business of policy making in the field of antitrust legislation. Congress has not left us at large to devise every feasible means for protecting the Government as a purchaser. It is the function of Congress to fashion means to that end, and Congress has discharged this duty from time to time according to its own wisdom. Our function ends with the endeavor to ascertain from the words used, construed in the light of the relevant material, what was in fact the intent of Congress.\n\n 1. \nWithout going beyond the words of the section, the use of the phrase 'any person' is insufficient to authorize an action by the Government. This conclusion is supported by the fact that if the purpose was to include the United States, 'the ordinary dignities of speech would have led' to its mention by name. \n8\n It is supported also by the collocation of the phrase in the section. The provision is that 'any person' injured by violation of the Act 'by any other person or corporation' may maintain an action for treble damages against the latter. It is hardly credible that Congress used the term 'person' in different senses in the same sentence. Yet, unless it did, the United States would not only be entitled to sue but would be liable to suit for treble damages. The more natural inference, we think, is that the meaning of the word was in both uses limited to what are usually known as natural and artificial persons, that is, individuals and corporations. In addition, the concluding words of the section give the injured party, as part of his costs, a reasonable attorney's fee,-a provision more appropriate for a private litigant than for the United States.\n\n 2. \nThe connotation of a term in one portion of an Act may often be clarified by reference to its use in others. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 607]\n\u00a0\n The word 'person' is used in several sections other than  7. In  1, 2, and 3, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-3, the phrase designating those liable criminally is 'every person who shall' etc. In each instance it is obvious that while the term 'person' may well in clude a corporation it cannot embrace the United States. In  8, 15 U.S.C.A.  7, Congress attempted to make clear that the term 'person' is to include a corporation. The provision is 'that the word 'person,' or 'persons,' wherever used in this act (section 1, 2, 3, or 15 of this chapter) shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of any State, or the laws of any foreign country.' The very fact, however, that this sweeping inclusion of various entities was thought important to preclude any narrow interpretation emphasizes the fact that if the United States was intended to be included Congress would have so provided We may say in passing that the argument that the United States may be treated as a corporation organized under its own laws, that is, under the Constitution as the fundamental law, seems so strained as not to merit serious consideration. It is fair to assume that the term 'person', in the absence of an indication to the contrary, was employed by the Congress throughout the Act in the same, and not in different, senses.\n\n 3. \nThe scheme and structure of the legislation is likewise important to a proper ascertainment of its purpose and intent. Sections 1, 2, and 3 impose criminal sanctions for violations of the acts denounced in those sections respectively. Section 4, 15 U.S.C.A.  4, gives jurisdiction to the federal courts of proceedings by the Government to restrain violations of the Act and imposes upon United States Attorneys the duty to institute equity proceedings to that end. Section 5, 15 U.S.C.A.  5, regulates service in such suits. Section 6, 15 U.S.C.A.  6, authorizes seizure, in the course of interstate transportation, of goods owned under any contract or pursuant to any conspiracy made illegal by the statute. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 608]\n\u00a0\n Thus far the Act deals in detail with the criminal and civil remedies of the Government in vindication of the policy of the legislation. There follows  7, the only other substantive section, giving a civil action for an injury to property rights.\n It seems evident that the Act envisaged two classes of actions,-those made available only to the Government, which are first provided in detail, and, in addition, a right of action for treble damages granted to redress private injury. If this be the fair construction of the Act, the Court's task is finished when it gives effect to the purposes of the law, evidenced by the various remedies it affords for different situations. Though the law gave a remedy by way of injunction at the suit of the United States, we were pressed to say that a private person should have the same remedy. We were compelled to answer that Congress had not seen fit so to provide. \n9\n For the like reasons we cannot hold that since a private purchaser is given a remedy for his losses in treble damages, the United States should be awarded the same remedy.\n\n 4. \nSupplemental legislation lends support to the view that Congress had in mind the distinction between public and private remedies and did not intend to confer a right of action on the United States by the use of the phrase 'any person' in  7. The antitrust provisions of the Wilson Tariff Act10 follow the same pattern as the Sherman Act. Section 7311 denounces combinations and agreements between parties importing articles from a foreign country and declares that every person guilty of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 609]\n\u00a0\n violation of its terms shall be punished. Section 74 confers jurisdiction upon the federal courts and authorizes proceedings in equity by the United States to restrain such acts. Section 76 provides for seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law and  77 gives an action for treble damages to any person against any other person or corporation in the exact words of  7 of the Sherman Act.\n The antidumping provisions of the Revenue Act of 191612 make it a criminal offense for 'any person' importing articles from a foreign country to sell, or cause to be imported or sold, such articles within the United States at substantially less than the market value of such articles at the time of exportation in the principal markets of the country of production, etc. They further declare that any person injured in his business or property by any violation may sue therefor in the United States courts and recover threefold damages and costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee. It must be obvious that the United States cannot be embraced by the phrase 'any person' there used.\n When Congress came to supplement the Sherman Act by the Clayton Act, 13 it included in the latter a significant section bearing upon the question under consideration. Doubts had arisen as to whether issues adjudicated in a criminal proceeding or a suit in equity brought by the United States should be taken as concluded in an action for treble damages subsequently brought by an injured party. By  5 of the Clayton Act it was sought to give such adjudication that effect. The section provides:\n'A final judgment or decree hereafter rendered in any criminal prosecution or in any suit or proceeding in \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 610]\n\u00a0\n equity brought by or on behalf of the United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant in any suit or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said laws as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto: Provided, This section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken.'\n\n Immediately following this provision the section continues:\n'Whenever any suit or proceeding in equity or criminal prosecution is instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain or punish violations of any of the antitrust laws, the running of the statute of limitations in respect of each and every private right of action arising under said laws and based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in said suit or proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof.'\n\n Here again it seems clear that Congress recognized the distinction between proceedings initiated by the Government to vindicate public rights and actions by private litigants for damages.\n It should be noted that  1 of the Clayton Act again defined the term 'person' exactly as it was defined by  8 of the Sherman Act, and  4 again enacted that any person injured by a violation might recover treble damages together with a reasonable attorney's fee.\n\n 5. \nThere has been a considerable body of judicial expression to the effect that  7 authorizes an action for damages only by private suitors and not by the Government. \n14\n While none of the cases presented the exact ques- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 611]\n\u00a0\n tion here involved, the statements bearing on the subject exhibit a uniform opinion contrary to the Government's present contention.\n\n 6. \nThe legislative history is persuasive that the Sherman Act was not intended to give the United States a civil action for damages. Senator Sherman, on March 18, 1890, introduced a bill which, in  1, provided that the United States might bring various civil actions and, in  2, that 'any person' should be entitled to sue any 'person' or 'corporation' for double damages. \n 15\n\u00a0\n\n In the discussion of the bill it was pointed out that  1 authorized the United States to bring civil actions including those for simple damages and that, under  2, private parties were entitled to sue for double damages. Senator Sherman stated that  2 gave a right to sue for double damages only to private parties and not to the United \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 612]\n\u00a0\n States. He stated that the civil suit by the United States authorized by  1 might be for an ouster of the power of the corporation, for damages, or in quo warranto, and added: 'But the second section provides purely a personal remedy, a civil suit also by citizens of the United States.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n As is well known, after Senator Sherman's bill had been amended, Senator Hoar rewrote most of the bill. In so doing he eliminated  1 with its provision for civil suits by the United States and substituted  1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, specifying the remedies, civil, criminal, and by way of forfeiture, available to the United States. In that revision he retained, with slight change,  2 of the bill, increasing the recoverable damages to treble instead of double, and renumbered the section as  7. In this form the bill was adopted.\n As already stated, the language of  7 of the Sherman Act was repeated in later statutes extending the antitrust laws although in the meantime this and other courts had expressed the view that the section accorded the Government no right of suit for treble damages. When the Clayton Act was before the Senate, Senator Culberson, Chairman of the Committee which reported the bill, enumerated the usual types of action prosecuted under the Sherman Act,-criminal prosecutions, suits in equity, and actions for damages, and stated with respect to Government suits under the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act: 'There is no suit authorized by any of these statutes except a criminal prosecution or a suit in equity. The United States does not bring a suit at law for damages.' 17 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 613]\n\u00a0\n In 1926 the Attorney General, in response to a Senate Resolution asking for information with respect to cases instituted under the first seven sections of the Sherman Act, wrote: 'Under Section 7, which gives to private persons the right to sue for injuries arising under the act, a number of actions have been instituted. The United States, however, under the statute is not a party to suits under that section.' \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Senator O'Mahoney has introduced a bill, which is pending as S. 2719, prepared jointly by him and by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of antitrust matters. On June 28, 1939, the Senator stated that the purpose of the bill was to provide more effective civil remedies. In the course of his statement he said: 'There is only one other remedy worth mentioning available under existing law to the Department of Justice-the civil action for an injunction. In addition, there is the action in damages by a private person who has been injured. Neither of these remedies is effective.' He further stated: 'The bill permits the United States, in effect, to bring a suit for damages against an offending corporation and against its individual directors and officers.' \n 19\n\u00a0\n\n\n 7. \nIt is significant that, in the light of the expressions by the courts, the supplemental legislation, and the legislative history, no action has ever been brought by the United States under  7 in the fifty years during which \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 614]\n\u00a0\n the statute has been in force until the present action was instituted. Down to the close of the year 1937, 428 criminal prosecutions and suits in equity had been instituted by the Government. \n20\n Down to December, 1939, 103 civil suits had been instituted by private persons, including corporations. \n21\n In the meantime the World War intervened with the Government a purchaser of enormous quantities of material and supplies. Then, as now, the complaint was prevalent that agreements and conspiracies existed to fix and maintain prices of materials needed by the Government. And throughout the life of the legislation able and vigilant officials devoted to enforcement of the policy of the Sherman Act have not been wanting.\n In these circumstances the conviction that no right to sue had been given the Government, rather than a supine neglect to resort to an available remedy seems to us the true explanation of the fact that no such actions have been instituted by the United States.\n In summary, we are of opinion that the text of the Act, taken in its natural and ordinary sense, makes against the extension of the term 'person' to include the United States and that the usual aids to construction, taken together, instead of inducing the contrary conclusion, go to support the view that Congress did not use the word in the sense for which the Government contends.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 615]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK (dissenting).\n In order to give purchasers of goods an opportunity to buy them at prices fixed by competitive trade, the Sherman Act made it illegal to fix prices by combination or conspiracy. It is difficult for me to believe that Congress did not intend to give equal protection to all purchasers similarly injured. In my judgment, no language of that Act, nothing in its history, and no argument now presented for our consideration makes necessary the conclusion that Congress intended to discriminate in favor of some purchasers and against others. It would require clear and unequivocal statutory language to persuade me that Congress intended to grant a remedy to all except one of those who were injured by trust prices- the 'all' including every natural and artificial person, every corporation and association,1 foreign and domestic, and the single exception \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 616]\n\u00a0\n being the United States, which buys more goods and services than any other single purchaser. \n2\n No such clear and unequivocal statutory language exists. And no plausible reason has been hazarded to prove that the government as a purchaser of goods needs less protection from unlawful combinations than do other buyers. \n3\n Many deplorable instances in our history, in fact, indicate the contrary. Congress, no doubt stimulated to action by these historical occurrences, has by numerous enactments recognized the urgent necessity for safeguarding governmental purchases of goods and services against unfair and collusive price-fixing. To that end, competitive bidding as a prerequisite to government contracts has been the general statutory rule over a long period of years, and combinations to deprive the government of the advantages of such competition have been made criminal. It is therefore strange indeed that the Sherman Act, the greatest of all legislative efforts to make competition, not combination, the law of trade, should now be found to afford a greater protection against collusive price-fixing to every other buyer in the United States than is afforded to the United States itself.\n So much for what seems to me to be the logical approach to the problem, and the one that should cause us to say that the government can sue for damages. If, however, we apply familiar canons of construction, I think we are led to the same result. For it is a primary principle that a law should be construed so as to carry \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 617]\n\u00a0\n out its purpose, in the light of the evil aimed at and the protection intended to be afforded. Here, among the evils legislated against was price-fixing by combination, and among the remedies afforded was the giving of a right of action to purchasers injured by prices so fixed. The result of this case-denying to the largest single purchaser of all goods manufactured and sold in the nation the protection afforded by this legislation-is to restrict the remedy in such way that the evil aimed at is less likely to be suppressed. For the construction given the Sherman Act, insofar as sales to the government and civil damages are concerned, enables those guilty of violating it to elude its provisions, escape its consequences, and defeat its objects.\n Nor do I believe that the previous failure of the Attorneys General of the United States to bring actions similar to this should be deemed a persuasive reason to read the government out of the Act's benefits. The 1926 statement of the Attorney General to the effect that 'the United States ... is not a party to suits under' section 7 does not supply such a reason. For in the quoted statement the Attorney General did not take the position that the government lacked the power to sue for civil damages; apparently what he had reference to was the fact that the Sherman Act did not make the United States a party to actions for civil damages by private persons against private persons. We do not know and cannot possibly determine why no prior suits were instituted for the benefit of the government. To assign reasons for such inaction is but to guess. And the guesses would doubtless vary almost in accordance with the preconceived notions of the guessers. But whatever might have been the reasons behind the government's failure to sue, sure it is that the Attorney General is not the purchasing agent of the government. He cannot be assumed to have constant knowledge of the manifold prob- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 618]\n\u00a0\n lems that face those who buy the government's supplies. In the final analysis, it is probably true that even an Attorney General who might zealously desire to enforce the criminal provisions of the Sherman Act would not likely be stimulated to institute civil proceedings for damages unless his attention was directed to the point by keenly alert and diligent purchasing agencies. To attempt to construe the Sherman Act by a vain effort to appraise the reasons responsible for the non-action of Attorneys General is a journey into the realm of imponderables I find it unnecessary to take. I would simply read the Act from its language and manifest purpose as giving all purchasers of goods a right to sue if they have been injured as the result of prices held up by those types of unlawful combination condemned by the Act. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The principle of strict construction now adopted in this case, resulting as it does in denying to the government the benefit of section 7 of the Sherman Act, is a radical departure from a long established policy under which the courts have construed laws most liberally in order to de- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 619]\n\u00a0\n clare the government entitled to their benefits. \n5\n And certainly it can hardly be denied that the language of the Act, giving all persons a right of action, should if liberally construed be held to justify suit by the United States. For in Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229, 231, decided forty years before the Sherman Act was adopted, this Court said in speaking of the United States: 'Every sovereign State is of necessity a body politic, or artificial person, and as such capable of making contracts and holding property. ... It would present a strange anomaly, indeed, if, having the power to make contracts and hold property as other persons, natural or artificial, they were not entitled to the same remedies for their protection.' And, speaking in similar vein in Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 92\n, 55 S.Ct. 50, 53, after having cited Blackstone for the proposition that the sovereign is a 'corporation', and after having gone even beyond this to hold that the statutory word 'resident' included the United States, the Court said: 'This may be in the nature of a legal fiction; but legal fictions have an appropriate place in the adminis- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 600, 620]\n\u00a0\n tration of the law when they are required by the demands of convenience and justice.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n These particular cases are but facets of a general rule that has long been accepted-the United States can exercise all of the legal remedies which other persons, bodies or associations can exercise, both at common law and under statutes,7 unless there is something in a statute or in its history to indicate an intent to deprive the United States of that right. \n8\n In this case, nothing in the Sherman Act itself and nothing in its legislative history makes necessary the conclusion that Congress intended to withhold from the United States a remedy given to all other purchasers. 9 Under these circumstances, it is my opinion that the judgment below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, 210, 15 U.S.C.A.  15 note. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] D.C., 31 F.Supp. 848. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 413. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Wilder Mfg.

Representative Webb the chairman of that Committee mentioned the civil remedies available under the bill as treble damage actions by persons, suits by the Federal Trade Commission, suits by the United States for injunctions, and similar suits by persons.

Senate Document No. 172, 76th Cong., 3rd Sess., Part 1, p. 4. The judgment here does not foreclose such corporations from suing for damages under section 7, or so I assume. If I am correct in my assumption, the result is that as to those purchases made by its corporate agencies, the Government is protected by the Sherman Act, while as to those purchases made by its non-corporate agencies, it is not so protected. A process of statutory construction which results in giving to government corporations a right denied to constitutionally authorized government departments seems to me to conflict with the frequently declared rule that a statute should not be interpreted in such way as to produce an unreasonable or unjust result. See United States v. American Trucking Associations, \n310 \nU.S. 534, 542\n, 543 S., 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063; Sorrells v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 435, 446\n, 53 S.Ct. 210, 214, 86 A.L.R. 249. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a recent study, see 'Government Purchasing-An Economic Commentary', Monograph No. 19 of the Temporary National Economic Committee ( 1940). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] An argument is offered to the effect that the government has no need of a right to damages, because it has the power to bring criminal and injunctive proceedings. But the right to bring those proceedings is given to the government for the protection of the public, rather than for its self protection as a purchaser. Further, criminal and injunctive proceedings, whatever their efficacy, do not achieve the object of section 7, which is to indemnify all injured purchasers. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Though the Act is all-inclusive in naming those who may sue for damages, it is not equally all-inclusive in describing those acts which may be regarded as unlawful combinations. This is true both because of the original language and objects of the Sherman Act itself, and because of subsequent legislation. The most notable example of such subsequent legislation is that portion of the Clayton Act which provides: 'The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce. Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations ... or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws.' 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C.  17, 15 U.S.C.A.  17. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469\n, 60 S.Ct. 982, 128 A.L.R. 1044. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It is argued that if the government can sue for damages it may also be sued for damages. That question is not before us and need not be decided. Other principles will be material if such a question ever should be presented. See United States v. Sherwood, \n312 \nU.S. 584\n, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. --, this day decided; Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 384 S., 58 S.Ct. 275, 277; United States v. Knight, 14 Pet. 301, 315. Among these principles the most important is that of sovereign immunity.

Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Andrew D. Sharpe, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Phil D. Morelock, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent seeks reimbursement from the United States of the amounts paid to processors to compensate them for processing taxes paid on cotton goods sold to respondent. The suit is based on a contract between respondent and the United States rather than on Title \n\n[312 \nU.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n VII of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1747, 7 U.S.C.A.  623 note 644 et seq., which authorizes refunds to processors, under certain circumstances, of processing taxes illegally collected under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. The question is whether the 'federal taxes' clause of the contract obligates the United States to make the reimbursement.\n Prior to June 6, 1933, the War Department called for bids on a contract to furnish a certain kind of mechanic's suit. On June 6, 1933, respondent submitted its bid, and on June 24, 1933, executed a contract with the United States whereby respondent agreed to furnish a specified number of the suits at a stated price. The contract provided, in the 'federal taxes' clause, that: 'Prices set forth herein include any Federal Tax heretofore imposed by the Congress which is applicable to the material purchased under this contract. If any sales tax, processing tax, adjustment charge, or other taxes or charges are imposed or changed by the Congress after the date set for the opening of the bid upon which this contract is based and made applicable directly upon the production, manufacture or sale of the supplies covered by this contract and are paid by the contractor on the articles or supplies herein contracted for, then the prices named in this contract will be increased or decreased accordingly. ...'\n To perform its contract with the United States, respondent contracted to purchase cotton cloth, thread, and labels from subcontractors who were liable, as processors, to pay any processing taxes levied on the articles sold to respondent. At the time these contracts were made no taxes were in effect on the processing of cotton, but in anticipation of such taxes respondent and the subcontractors agreed that respondent would reimburse them for any taxes they were required to pay on the processing of goods sold to respondent, the taxes to be billed as a sepa- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n rate item. Thereafter, respondent received the goods covered by these contracts and compensated the subcontractors for the taxes they were later required to pay on the processing of the cotton. It has performed its contract with the United States and now claims that the quoted provision obligates the United States to pay respondent the amounts it has paid its subcontractors to compensate them for the processing taxes they have paid. Because the Comptroller General rejected its claim, respondent brought this suit in the Court of Claims and obtained judgment. 32 F.Supp. 141. We granted certiorari on October 14, 1940, to resolve the uncertainty as to the correct construction of the 'federal taxes' clause which appears in a large number of government contracts. \n311 \nU.S. 624\n, 61 S.Ct. 24, 85 L.Ed . --.\n The only question is whether the United States, in the 'federal taxes' clause, has agreed to pay respondent the amount respondent paid its subcontractors to reimburse them for taxes paid on the processing of the goods sold to respondent. We hold that it has not.\n We are of opinion that the 'federal taxes' clause does not obligate the United States to reimburse its contractor for taxes which the latter has borne merely as a matter of contract with its subcontractors. On the contrary, the fair import of the clause is that the United States must make reimbursement only for such taxes as the contractor has paid pursuant to an obligation imposed upon him by the statute which exacts the tax.\n The language of the clause is precise. It provides only for reimbursement of those taxes which are 'made applicable directly upon the production, manufacture, or sale of the supplies covered by this contract'. The supplies 'covered by this contract' are the mechanics' suits, the completed articles furnished to the United States. Since the clause further provides in exact language that the tax must be 'directly' applicable, we cannot agree that a tax on the cloth, thread, and labels is a tax on the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n 'supplies covered by this contract'. Compare Telescope Folding Furniture Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 31 F.Supp. 780, 784; United States v. Glenn L. Martin Co., \n308 \nU.S. 62\n, 60 S.Ct. 32, 124 A.L.R. 1017.\n Moreover, the clause stipulates for reimbursement of taxes 'paid by the contractor'. It is reasonable to conclude that this phrase also contemplates payment of taxes to the United States in consequence of an obligation imposed by statute upon respondent. For while in a sense, perhaps, respondent 'paid' these processing taxes, it is more accurate to say that they were 'paid' by the subcontractors who merely shifted their burden to respondent as a separate item of the contract price. The clause as a whole indicates that this was the sense to be attributed to the phrase quoted.\n A contrary construction of the 'federal taxes' clause introduces difficulties not contemplated by the parties. It would force them to trace the taxes back to the one upon whom the obligation first rested, whether the subsequent transactions were simple or complex. For if it could be said in this case that the processing taxes were imposed on the supplies covered by the contract and were paid by the contractor, it would be immaterial how far the contractor were removed from the original processor if the former could show that the burden of the tax had been shifted as the processed articles had changed hands and perhaps form. We can find nothing which suggests that the parties intended to draft a clause that would operate in such fashion.\n We conclude that the quoted clause does not obligate the United States to compensate respondent for taxes which were paid by its subcontractors and were merely shifted to respondent pursuant to their subcontract. The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the petition.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. GOLTRA(1941)\nNo. 191\nArgued: January 9, 1941Decided: February 3, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 204]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Messrs. Herman J. Galloway, of Washington, D.C., and Frederick W. P. Lorenzen, of New York City, for Goltra and others.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appeal brings here the correctness of the ruling by the Court of Claims which allows interest on a claim against the appellant, the United States. The cross appeal raises an issue that the compensation awarded is inadequate because the court failed to consider certain evidence as to the value for lease or use of the property involved. \n1\n The judgment was entered upon a petition filed under authority of a private jurisdictional act, quoted in the margin. 2 \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 205]\n\u00a0\n This controversy had its inception on March 25, 1923. At that time Edward F. Goltra was the lessee of four tug boats and 19 steel barges belonging to the United States. While tied up for the winter on the Mississippi at the Port of St. Louis, they were repossessed, because of an alleged breach of the lease, by Colonel Ashburn, Chief of the Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service, under orders from the Acting Secretary of War. Apparently some unloading facilities were also seized. In several court proceedings to recover possession Mr. Goltra was defeated. \n3\n It would be futile to examine as to whether these adjudications determined all or any controversies between the parties, since the jurisdictional act opened the doors of the Court, 'notwithstanding the lapse of time or the bar of any statute of limitations or previous court decisions.' Suing under this special legislation Mr. Goltra4 sought damages for the wrongful taking of the fleet and facilities and recovered $350,000 with six per cent interest from March 25, 1923, to the date of payment. The Government assigns error only to the allowance of interest and the executors only to the refusal to consider certain proffered evidence.\n By a contract of 1919, with a supplement of 1921, Mr. Goltra leased the fleet of river boats for governmentally \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 206]\n\u00a0\n supervised operation as common carriers on the Mississippi and its tributaries from the Chief of Engineers as lessor. The lessor was acting for the War Department, the executive agency in charge of the boats. The term of the lease was five years from the delivery of the first unit of the fleet, which occurred on July 15, 1922. All net earnings were sequestered during the term for application upon the purchase of the fleet at cost or appraised value as detailed in the lease, with provision for subsequent installment payments over sixteen years. Section eight provided for termination by the lessor upon the lessee's noncompliance 'in his judgment with any of the terms and conditions' and for the return to the lessor of the plant, barges and towboats.\n On March 4, 1921, the Secretary of War consented, in accordance with the lease, that Mr. Goltra's tariffs should be 80 per cent of the prevailing rail tariffs. This consent was withdrawn in May, 1922, before the delivery of the boats, and a consent limited to specific articles substituted. A control over the amount of grain to be carried was delegated to the Federal Manager of the Mississippi-Warrior River Service, a government corporation which operated a competing line. The enterprise got under way in the summer of 1922 and was immediately entangled in the ordinary vicissitudes of river transportation. The towboats had mechanical deficiencies; the open barges were not suitable for grain or other perishables; low water seriously interfered with navigation. After a few months towing by one tug, the fleet went into winter quarters late in the fall. Before business was resumed, Mr. Goltra was notified on March 4, 1923, by the Secretary of War that the lease was terminated and he was directed to turn over the towboats, barges and unloading facilities to Colonel Ashburn. Obedience to this order was refused and on March 25, 1923, Colonel Ashburn, under orders from the Acting \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 207]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of War, took possession of the fleet without the consent of Mr. Goltra or his employees, for the use and benefit of the United States.\n The seizure was without the knowledge of the Chief of Engineers, who was the lessor empowered by its terms to terminate the lease, and that officer had not reached any conclusion to the effect that Mr. Goltra had in any manner failed in his obligations under the contract. Subsequently, in April, the Chief of Engineers terminated the lease pursuant to section eight. The action did not represent his judgment but was done under direction of his superior, the Secretary of War.\n The Court of Claims fixed the damages as of the time of seizure, with interest to the date of payment 'not as interest but as a part of just compensation.'\n Interest. By statute,5 derived from the Act of March 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 766, no interest is allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment by the Court of Claims. This accords with the traditional immunity of the Government from the burden of interest unless it is specifically agreed upon by contract or imposed by legislation. \n6\n Without controverting this general rule, the executors find authority for the allowance of interest in the provision of the jurisdictional act for 'just compensation ... for certain vessels and unloading apparatus taken, whether tortiously or not ..., for the use and befefit of the United States.' Their argument is that the words 'just compensation' have within themselves the same legal significance of interest on the award or damages from the date of the taking as has been given to these same words \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 208]\n\u00a0\n in the Fifth Amendment. They further urge that this interpretation is required by the phrase in the act 'for the use and benefit of the United States' and the accepted finding that Colonel Ashburn's taking was for that purpose. In support of this position, the ruling of this Court in Seaboard Air Line Railway Company v. United States7 and subsequent similar authority8 is relied upon.\n In the Seaboard case, section 10 of the Lever Act, 40 Stat. 279, authorizing the taking by eminent domain of property for the public use on payment of just compensation was under examination. It contains no specific provision for interest. This Court held that a taking under the authority of section 10 required the just compensation 'provided for by the Constitution' and that such compensation is payable 'as of the time when the owners were deprived of their property.' \n9\n This case, however, and the others cited in the preceding paragraph, involve the requisitioning or taking of property by eminent domain under authority of legislation. The distinction between property taken under authorization of Congress and property appropriated without such authority has long been recognized. \n10\n Acts of government officials in taking property without authorization of Congress confer no right of recovery upon the injured citizen. \n11\n There are two instances of Congressional ratification of takings which turned tortious acts into the exercise of the power of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 209]\n\u00a0\n eminent domain and placed upon the Government the duty to make 'just compensation,' including sums in the nature of interest. These are United States v. Creek Nation12 and Shoshone Tribe v. United States. \n13\n In both cases there was a special jurisdictional act. In neither case was interest expressly allowed. In both this Court found Congressional confirmation of the previously unauthorized acts; in the Creek case, by disposition of the wrongfully acquired lands and failure to seek cancellation of the disposals after 'full knowledge of the facts'14 and in the Shoshone case by 'the statutes already summarized, recognizing the Arapahoes equally with the Shoshones as occupants of the land, accepting their deeds of cession, assigning to the tribes equally the privilege of new allotments, and devoting to the two equally the award of future benefits.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n In the case now before us, however, there is neither the requisite Congressional authority before the taking nor any ratification or confirmation of the tort after the taking, which would justify a conclusion that the fleet was acquired by eminent domain. The jurisdictional act in itself is not an exercise of the power of eminent domain. \n16\n As the lease required action by the Chief of Engineers, the attempt to cancel it by the letter of the Secretary of War of March 3, 1923, and the order of the Acting Secretary of March 22, 1923, to take possession was unauthorized. The lower court found the taking tortious. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 210]\n\u00a0\n Nor can it be said that the continued possession and use by the United States indicated any confirmation or ratification of the tortious act, so as to bring this case within the rule of the Creek or Shoshone cases. A reading of the reports of the prior litigation18 makes abundantly clear that the United States relied upon the termination of the lease by the Chief of Engineers which was practically contemporaneous with, though subsequent to, the taking, as their justification for possession of the fleet and property. This reliance found complete support in the various cited decisions of the courts, even though Mr. Goltra's petition for rehearing in this Court pointed out that the letter of the Chief of Engineers was written to justify the seizure. \n19\n Notwithstanding these definite judicial decisions upon the rights of the parties, Congress felt that Mr. Goltra may not have had fair treatment. It passed the present jurisdictional act and to that the executors are relegated to find authority to allow interest.\n Such acts are to be strictly construed. \n20\n In the pre- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 211]\n\u00a0\n ceding paragraphs we have demonstrated that this unauthorized taking and judicially approved retention was in no sense an exercise of the power of eminent domain. We see no ground to read into this act of grace, which was apparently drawn to rectify what Congress felt might be a wrong, an authority to allow interest as a part of just compensation. If interest was to be allowed for so long a period upon an ordinary claim, and contrary to established governmental practice, Congress would have so declared. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Evidence. The main issue raised by the appeal of Mr. Goltra's executors relates to the evidence. In its opinion the Court of Claims said:\n'It is contended by the plaintiff that, in arriving at just compensation, an offer to rent the fleet made years after the fleet had been seized and the rental value of similar vessels on the Mississippi River should be taken into consideration. These contentions cannot be sustained.'\n\n Assuming that these items of evidence were competent, we cannot say that the Court of Claims, making a jury award, was bound to give them weight. The actual damages suffered by Mr. Goltra were highly speculative, especialy since the contract was subject to lawful cancellation whenever the Chief of Engineers rightly or wrongly but in good faith determined that Mr. Goltra was violating its provisions. Mr. Goltra's operation under the lease had been a losing venture. Under these circumstances, the Court of Claims may have believed that an offer to purchase, made in May, 1925, was too remote to influence its judgment and that the rental value of other vessels on the Mississippi, not subject to the same restrictions as those taken by the Govern- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 203, 212]\n\u00a0\n ment, was too unreliable to afford a useful comparison. It was for the Court of Claims to decide what weight such facts deserved, and we construe its opinion only as holding that under the circumstances of this case the evidence was not considered to be of any assistance in reaching a conclusion.\n Mr. Goltra's executors also complain of the failure of the Court of Claims to make certain findings, but there is no indication that the Court of Claims did not consider the facts which were embodied in the proposed findings.\n The judgment in No. 191 is modified as indicated in the opinion and, as modified, affirmed; the judgment in No. 192 is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration and decision of these appeals. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Both parties also sought review by petition for certiorari because of this Court's decision in Colgate v.

The inclusion of the phrase 'as of right' in the jurisdictional act sufficiently makes clear the intention of Congress to authorize either party to take a technical to this Court. Cf.

KALES(1941)\nNo. 35\nArgued: November 14, 1941Decided: December 8, 1941\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 187]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hal H. Smith, of Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Two questions are presented for decision by the record in this case. First, was a letter written to the tax collector \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 190]\n\u00a0\n by respondent taxpayer and lodged with the Commissioner a claim for refund of overpaid taxes so as to stop the running of the statute of limitations against the claim? Second, did a judgment refunding taxes paid to the collector in 1925 upon profits from the sale of certain shares of stock in 1919 bar a later suit for a further recovery of 1919 taxes overpaid in 1920 to a different collector upon profits from the same transaction?\n In 1919 respondent was the owner of 525 shares of the stock of the Ford Motor Company which she had acquired before March 1, 1913. In anticipation of the sale of the stock she requested and obtained in 1919 from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a ruling that the March 1st, 1913 value of the stock was $9,489 per share. She then sold the stock for $ 12,500 a share and reported in her income tax return for 1919 the profit over the March 1, 1913 value thus established. In 1920 she paid the tax so computed, amounting to $1,216,086, to Collector Grogan, since deceased.\n In March, 1925, the Commissioner made a jeopardy deficiency assessment against respondent for an increase of profit on the sale of the stock in 1919, on the ground that respondent had overstated the 1913 value of the stock in her 1919 tax return. Respondent paid the additional assessment, amounting to $2,627,309, to Collector Woodworth on March 24, 1925. At the same time she lodged with the collector and the Commissioner a written protest, dated March 23, 1925, against the jeopardy assessment on the ground, among others, that the Commissioner was without authority in law to reopen and set aside the 1913 valuation of the stock as determined in 1919 by the then Commissioner, on the basis of which respondent had sold her stock. By paragraph 9 of the protest respondent also advised the collector, the Commissioner and the Government, that while it was respondent's position that the deficiency assessment was illegal and void for this and \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 191]\n\u00a0\n other reasons stated, if the Internal Revenue Department, the Board of Tax Appeals or any court having jurisdiction should hold that the assessment of March 1, 1913 value of her stock, made in 1919, should be vacated, set aside, reopened or reversed, then respondent would insist that the valuation fixed by the Commissioner in 1919 was less than the fair market value as of March 1, 1913, that the 1919 tax which she had paid in 1920 was correspondingly excessive and that she should recover the tax to the extent of such excess when the fair value had been determined. She added in paragraph 10 that 'if for any reason a revaluation shall be had', she 'will insist' that the stock was greatly undervalued by the Department and 'will claim the right to a refund' of the excess tax collected.\n After a claim duly filed for refund of the amount of the jeopardy assessment, paid in 1925, respondent brought suit in the district court against Collector Woodworth, which resulted in a judgment for the taxpayer for the full amount of the assessment with interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment, Woodworth v. Kales, 26 F.2d 178, which was satisfied in November, 1928\n\n\n September 24, 1928, respondent filed a formal claim for refund of the taxes paid in 1919, stated to be an amendment of the claim for refund contained in her letter of protest of March 23, 1925. By the amendment respondent sought an additional refund of income taxes, paid for the year 1919, in the amount of $195,710 with interest, upon the ground that the Ford stock, as the Board of Tax Appeals had then determined in James Couzens v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 11 B.T.A. 1040, had a March 1, 1913 value of $10,000 per share, and that she should accordingly have the benefit of this higher basis in computing her profit. At a hearing granted by the General Counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue on June 13, 1929, the amended claim was considered on the merits. Again in January, 1933, a mem- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 192]\n\u00a0\n ber of his staff, at a conference with respondent's attorney, advised the latter that the informal claim was filed in time and was good as an informal claim.\n By letter of June 4, 1935, however, the Commissioner declined to act upon it, on the single ground that because respondent's judgment for refund of the jeopardy assessment for 1919 taxes had been satisfied 'the Bureau is precluded from giving further consideration in any respect to the matter of your income tax liability for the taxable year 1919.' This was followed by the Deputy Commissioner's letter of August 20, 1935 to respondent, stating that 'the refund claim filed in 1925 was merged into the judgment ... and you were, therefore, precluded from filing an amendment to the earlier claim which had been finally adjudicated.' The letter added 'The adjudication by the court removed this matter from the realm of administrative action other than to make refund as directed by the judgment.'\n Collector Grogan having retired from office and having died, the present suit for refund of the overpayment of the tax claimed was brought in the district court against the United States under the provisions of  1122(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 331. This section authorizes suits in the district court for the refund of overpayment of revenue taxes even if in excess of $10,000 to be brought against the United States where the collector to whom the overpayment was made is dead or is not in office when the suit is brought. The judgment of the district court dismissing the suit on motion was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 6 Cir., 115 F.2d 497, which held that the letter of March 23, 1925, was a timely informal claim for refund which had been perfected by the formal amended claim filed in September, 1928, that consequently the respondent's cause of action was not barred by limitation and that recovery was not precluded by the previous judgment for recovery of the jeopardy assessment for 1919. We granted \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 193]\n\u00a0\n certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 553\n, 61 S.Ct. 940, upon petition of the Government, which urged that any further recovery for overpayment of the 1919 tax was barred by the judgment in the respondent's suit and recovery of the jeopardy assessment for that year, a question of importance in the administration of the revenue laws. The Government urges as grounds for reversal that if respondent's letter of March 23, 1925 be considered a claim for refund any recovery is barred by the 1928 judgment, and that in any event the letter was not a claim for refund and does not support the present suit.\n First: Concededly recovery of the 1919 tax, paid in 1920, is not barred by limitation if respondent's letter of March 23, 1925, be treated as a claim for refund. The Collector of Internal Revenue extended the respondent's time to make return of her 1919 income taxes for thirty days from March 15, 1920, and her letter was placed with the Commissioner within five years of the expiration of the extended time. Section 284(h) of the 1926 Revenue Act, 44 Stat. 9, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 223, provides that a claim for refund of 1919 taxes shall not be barred by a lapse of time if filed within five years from the date when the return was due. Revised Statutes,  3226, 26 U.S.C.  1672, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code ,  3772, makes the filing of a claim for refund in accordance with the law and Treasury regulations a condition precedent to suit to recover it. Article 1306 of Treasury Regulation 65, promulgated under the 1924 Revenue Act and applicable here, provides that claims for refund shall be made upon Form 843, setting forth all the facts relied on under oath. But Treasury Decision 4266, promulgated March 27, 1929, authorizes the Commissioner to make a refund after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation, even though no formal claim has been filed before that time, in any case in which an informal or defective claim, duly filed prior to the expiration of the period of limitation and stating specifically the grounds for the refund, is perfected by the filing of a claim prior to May 1, 1929. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 194]\n\u00a0\n This Court, applying the statute and regulations, has often held that a notice fairly advising the Commissioner of the nature of the taxpayer's claim, which the Commissioner could reject because too general or because it does not comply with formal requirements of the statute and regulations, will nevertheless be treated as a claim where formal defects and lack of specificity have been remedied by amendment filed after the lapse of the statutory period. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S.Ct. 278; United States v. Factors & Finance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 89\n, 53 S.Ct. 287; Bemis Bros. Bag Co. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 28\n, 53 S.Ct. 454; Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 53 S.Ct. 620, 624. This is especially the case where such a claim has not misled the Commissioner and he has accepted and treated it as such. Bonwit Teller Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 258\n, 51 S. Ct. 395; United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra, 288 U.S. at page 70, 53 S.Ct. at page 281.\n In applying these guiding principles to the case in hand it is necessary to read the letter of March 23, 1925, in the light of the peculiar circumstances then well known to the Commissioner and referred to in the letter. The letter dealt with two distinct subjects. One was the jeopardy assessment which the taxpayer was about to pay and did in fact pay to the collector on the following day when the letter in duplicate was given to the collector and the Commissioner. The other, stated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the letter, related to the liability of the Government for overpayments of 1919 taxes made to Collector Grogan in 1920 in the event that the Commissioner's 1919 assessment of the Ford stock should be set aside by the courts or administrative action. In that event the letter recites that the 1919 valuation was too low, the tax paid in 1920 was too high, and asserts the taxpayer's consequent 'right to a refund of said tax to the extent of such excess.'\n The letter states correlative alternative rights on which the taxpayer relied. One was the challenge to the validity \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 195]\n\u00a0\n of the 1925 jeopardy assessment on the ground that the appraisal in 1919 of the then Commissioner was unalterable. The other was respondent's right to a refund of taxes paid in 1920 in the event that the 1919 appraisement of the stock should be set aside by the Bureau or be determined to be erroneous. Whether the Commissioner would insist upon changing the 1919 appraisal of her stock, and whether in any case the Board of Tax Appeals would find a different 1913 value for the stock, were matters for future determination. When respondent filed her letter the time within which a claim for refund could be filed was about to expire, and the occurrence of the contingencies on which a recovery could be had by respondent remained uncertain. But the Commissioner could have been left in no doubt that she was setting forth her right to a refund in the event of a departmental revision of its 1919 valuation of her stock. Her letter was present notice that if the department insisted upon changing its original decision as to the 1913 value, she asserted that the stock had been undervalued and in consequence of the undervaluation she had a 'right to a refund of said ( 1919) tax to the extent of such excess'. Her concluding paragraph made the like assertion 'if for any reason a revaluation shall be had' of the Ford stock. At that time the Commissioner had assessed deficiencies aggregating $ 31,000,000 against former Ford stockholders who had sold stock which they had acquired before March 1, 1913. See James Couzens v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 11 B.T.A. 1040, 1043, 1044. Respondent's amended formal claim of September 11, 1928, only made more specific the allegations of her earlier informal claim by stating that the Board of Tax Appeals had found the 1913 value of the stock to be $10,000 per share and by computing the excess tax, the right to which had been asserted in the earlier claim.\n The fact that respondent had originally stated her claim in the future tense, saying that in the event of depart- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 196]\n\u00a0\n mental revision of the valuation of the stock she 'will insist' on a higher valuation and 'will claim the right to a refund', does not in the circumstances of this case lend even grammatical support to the Government's contention. Such a use of the future tense in stating a claim may, with due regard to the circumstances of making it, rightly be taken as an assertion of a present right. See Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 198 S., 36 S.Ct. 541, 544; cf. George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, supra, 289 U.S. at page 384, 53 S.Ct. at page 624, reversing, 5 Cir., 61 F.2d 605. Here the claim is alternative and contingent upon future events. The statement that upon the happening of the contingency the claim will be prosecuted is not inconsistent with the present assertion of it. It is indeed an appropriate, if not the necessary phraseology for the present assertion of an alternative claim with respect to which a taxpayer in his presentation of an informal tax refund claim, should be in no less favorable position than the plaintiff in a suit at law who is permitted to plead his cause of action in the alternative. See Rule 8(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c; United States v. Richards, 6 Cir., 79 F.2d 797.\n If the point were more doubtful than we think it is, it would be resolved by the consistent administrative treatment of respondent's letter of March 23, 1925, and the later amendment as a claim for refund. Neither the original nor the amended claim has ever been rejected as inadequate by the Commissioner or the Bureau. There has been no objection to the claim on the ground that it was informal, deficient in its content, or untimely. Acknowledgment of the letter of March 23, 1925 by the Commissioner referred to the jeopardy assessment, but made no mention of the asserted right to refund of taxes paid in 1920. After the amendment was filed in September, 1928, the claim was held under advisement by the Bureau for nearly seven years. As we have said, it was consistently treated in correspondence by the Bureau and at hearings \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 197]\n\u00a0\n during this period as a claim for refund. The Commissioner finally by his letters of June 4, 1935 and August 25, 1935, declined to consider the claim on the sole ground that it was no longer a subject of administrative action because 'the refund claim filed in 1925 was merged into the judgment' for refund of the tax paid on the jeopardy assessment. Not only do we think that this entire course of departmental action was an administrative construction of respondent's letter of March 23, 1925, conforming to our own interpretation of its words, but we think it was a waiver of the requirements of the regulations as to the formality and particularity with which the grounds for refund are required to be stated. Bonwit Teller Co. v. United States, supra, 283 U.S. at page 264, 51 S.Ct. at page 397; United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra, 288 U.S. at page 70, 53 S.Ct. at page 281; cf. Tucker v. Alexander, \n275 \nU.S. 228, 231\n, 48 S.Ct. 45, 46; United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., \n302 \nU.S. 528, 533\n, 58 S.Ct. 320, 323.\n Second: The Government argues that the right to recover for overpayment of income taxes in any tax year constitutes a single cause of action against the Government and that the present suit by the respondent, seeking recovery of 1919 taxes, after having recovered the amount of the jeopardy assessment for the same year involved an inadmissible splitting of her cause of action. In any event it insists that no cause of action for recovery of overpayment of 1919 taxes could survive the recovery of the amount of the jeopardy assessment, since the judgment for that recovery merged all claims for overpayment of 1919 taxes and so foreclosed the present suit for additional overpayments of taxes growing out of the same transaction.\n But we think these contentions disregard the statutory scheme which has been set up for the recovery from an internal revenue collector, of taxes which he had unlawfully collected. See Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415. Originally payment under protest to an internal revenue \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 198]\n\u00a0\n collector of illegally exacted taxes gave rise to a common law cause of action against the collector for restitution of the overpayment. Elliott v. Swarthwout, 10 Pet. 137, 153, 156; Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, supra, 289 U.S. at page 375, 53 S.Ct. 373, and cases cited. By the protest the collector was informed of the contention of the taxpayer and was thus precluded from relieving himself, by payment into the Treasury of the moneys collected, from liability to make restitution. Elliott v. Swarthwout, supra; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 42 S.Ct. 1. By a series of Congressional acts it was made the duty of the collector to pay to the Government the moneys collected, regardless of a protest. 12 Stat. 442; 13 Stat. 483; R.S.  3210; 26 U.S.C .  1761, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  3971. But with imposition of this duty on the collector to pay over, the Government undertook to indemnify him upon certification by the court either that there was probable cause for the act done by the collector or that he acted under directions of the Secretary of the Treasury or other proper officers of the Government. 12 Stat. 741,  12. In that event no execution was to issue against him but the amount of recovery was to be paid out of the Treasury. These provisions, carried into Revised Statutes  989, are continued as 28 U.S.C .  842, 28 U.S.C.A.  842. By  1014 of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, amending Revised Statutes  3226, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 128, the requirement for protest of the payment was abolished.\n While the effect of the certificate in indemnifying the collector has been said to convert the suit against him into a suit against the Government, at least so far as the ultimate incidence of the liability is concerned, United States v. Sherman, \n98 \nU.S. 565\n, 567; Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, supra, 289 U.S. at page 381, 53 S.Ct. at page 623, the statutory provisions have not altered the nature and extent of the claims which the taxpayer is authorized to prosecute in suits against the collector. Originally it was the payment of the illegally exacted tax which gave rise to the cause of action. It \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 199]\n\u00a0\n was the payment which designated the person against whom the suit might be brought and which measured the right of recovery. Payments made to one collector could not be recovered from another, and since the cause of action against the two collectors were different recovery upon one could not bar recovery upon the other.\n After the enactment of legislation requiring collectors of customs to pay over to the Government duties collected under protest, 5 Stat. 348; R. S.  3010, doubts arose whether suit could, in such circumstances, be maintained against them, since it was thought that the statutory command had relieved the collectors from personal liability. See Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236. But those doubts were put at rest by later acts of Congress establishing the continued right of the taxpayer to maintain a suit against such a collector notwithstanding payment over of his collections to the Treasury. 5 Stat. 727, R.S.  3011; Curtis' Administratrix v. Fiedler, 2 Black 461, 479; Arnson v. Murphy, \n109 \nU.S. 238, 241\n, 3 S.Ct. 184, 186. A like uncertainty as to the effect of the statutes requiring internal revenue collectors to pay moneys collected to the Government was resolved by this Court's decisions in Philadelphia v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 720, 731; The Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 13. As Congress had enacted provisions for indemnification of the collector by the Government, the implication necessarily arose that the taxpayer could maintain an action against him. See 12 Stat. 434, 729, 741; 13 Stat. 239.\n The right of action thus continued is identical with that which existed before Congress had acted. Notwithstanding the provision for indemnifying the collector and protecting him from execution, the nature and extent of the right asserted and the measure of the recovery remain the same. It was payment to the collector which gave rise to the suit against him and limited the amount of the recovery. The judgment against the collector is a personal judgment, to which the United States is a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 186, 200]\n\u00a0\n stranger except as it has obligated itself to pay it. See Sage v. United States, supra; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., supra, 257 U.S. at pages 4, 5, 42 S.Ct. at pages 1, 2.\n While the statutes have for most practical purposes reduced the personal liability of the collector to a fiction, the course of the legislation indicates clearly enough that it is a fiction intended to be acted upon to the extent that the right to maintain the suit and its incidents, until judgment rendered, are to be left undisturbed. Among its incidents are the right to a jury trial, which is not available in suits against the United States. 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20).\n By no possibility could the respondent in the suit brought against Collector Woodworth in 1925 recover taxes paid to Collector Grogan in 1920, which she demands here. Recovery from one collector of the payment to him does not bar recovery on the different cause of action arising upon payment to the other, even though the two collections are for taxes arising out of the same transaction.

KANSAS FLOUR MILLS CORPORATION(1941)\nNo. 45\nArgued: November 21, 1941Decided: December 8, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edgar Shook and Phil D. Morelock, both of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 212, 213]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Between May, 1935, and January 6, 1936, the respondent entered into eight contracts for the sale of flour to the United States. Deliveries were duly made and the contract price was paid.\n Each of the eight contracts provided: 'Prices set forth herein include any Federal tax heretofore imposed by the Congress which is applicable to the material purchased under this contract. If any sales tax, processing tax, adjustment charge or other taxes or charges are imposed or changed by the Congress after the date set for the opening of the bid upon which this contract is based and made applicable directly upon the production, manufacture, or sale of the supplies covered by this contract, and are paid to the Government by the contractor on the articles or supplies herein contracted for, then the prices named in this contract will be increased or decreased accordingly, and any amount due the contractor as a result of such change will be charged to the Government and entered on vouchers (or invoices) as separate items.'\n Under the terms of the Agricultural Adjustment Act,1 processing taxes were due in respect of the flour sold aggregating $28,419.20.\n In 1936 the respondent entered into four contracts for the sale of flour and bran to the United States for a total price of $23,288.11. The commodities were delivered and vouchers for the purchase price tendered to the General Accounting Office. Payment was withheld by the Comptroller General who notified the respondent that the Government had overpaid it in the sum of $28,419.20.\n The respondent had obtained an injunction against the collection of any processing taxes from it and, as a result \n\n[314 \nU.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n of the decision in United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914, paid no processing taxes on the wheat used in the manufacture of flour covered by the 1935 contracts.\n The respondent sued in the Court of Claims to recover the purchase price under the four 1936 contracts and contested the offsets claimed by the Government arising out of the eight 1935 contracts. Judgment was rendered in favor of the respondent for $23,288.11. We granted certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 554\n, 61 S.Ct. 1085, because of the importance of the question2 and of the number of pending cases involving the same question. We are of opinion that the respondent was not entitled to recover.\n The contracts are to be construed in the light of the relations between the parties at the time they were executed. The Agricultural Adjustment Act did not exempt a vendor to the United States from the processing tax; and a Treasury Regulation required that he pay the tax. \n3\n The quoted clause shows that this tax was specifically in the minds of the parties, for it was stipulated that it was included in the price bid. The Government stood in a dual relation to the respondent. It became, at the same time, a purchaser at the named price and also a claimant of the processing tax upon the material purchased. The stipulation was evidently made in view of the facts that the purchasing officer could not buy the goods tax-free and that the Government desired that the price to it should be ex-tax. To accomplish this the sale price was pro tanto offset by the amount of the tax. Plainly, if the United States had not been thought entitled to collect the tax, the bid price would not have been acceptable. Plainly, also, if the respondent had not been thought \n\n[314 \nU.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n liable for the tax, the bid price would have been less. \n4\n As disclosed by the contracts, the understanding was that the price would have been less by the amount of the tax. The respondent disputes this, contending that we cannot say how much of the tax it was willing to absorb in order to obtain the contracts; that it may have been making the sales at an actual loss. But this is not the theory of the contracts. They provide that if, in future, any existing tax described therein is changed by Congress the price named in each contract 'will be increased or decreased accordingly.' This does not mean, as contended by respondent, that the amount of increase or decrease is an unknown quantity to be made definite and certain by proof. It means that the amount of any increase in tax shall be added and the amount of any decrease subtracted from the contract price. This view is strengthened by the provision for separate billing of the increase, if any.\n The respondent, however, argues that, under any construction, the Government is not entitled to maintain its set-off, first, because the contracts contain no undertaking by respondent that it will pay the tax and, secondly, that, even if they do, the stipulation for reduction of price applies only to changes by Congress and excludes relief from the tax by an adjudication that the exaction is unconstitutional.\n In support of the first proposition, the respondent relies on numerous decisions holding tax clauses in private contracts not to require adjustment of the contract price as a result of the decision in the Butler case, supra. \n5\n These \n\n[314 \nU.S. 212, 216]\n\u00a0\n go on the absence of an express provision respecting the constitutional validity and upon the omission of the parties to bill the tax separately from the purchase price. We think they are inapplicable in the present case since the tax clause here had a purpose different from those in private contracts. As we have said, the purpose here was to deprive either party of the advantage or disadvantage resulting from the incidence of the tax and, therefore, it was sought to eliminate the effect of the exaction on the contract price.\n In the case of private contracts, the vendees purchase for resale and the tax burden assumed is passed on to their customers. The fact that the processor-the vendor-is protected from the payment of the tax by injunction does not reduce the price to the vendee or to purchasers from him. The courts will not permit the unjust enrichment involved in recovery by the vendee of the amount of tax which he has passed on to his customers. 6 In the contracts in question, the Government did not buy for resale. Unless it received the tax it suffered a definite disadvantage. \n7\n Its purpose, as shown by the contracts, was to balance the tax element in the price \n\n[314 \nU.S. 212, 217]\n\u00a0\n paid with the tax collected. \n8\n The Government, which could not pass on the tax on resale, was thus protected, not against a fall in the market price but against a loss in its tax revenues. In cases of private sales, the processor's injunction against collection of the tax, as held by the cases cited, worked no harm to his vendee. A similar injunction, in the case of Government contracts, would leave the price to the Government at the higher level reflecting the tax and deprive the Government of the reciprocal benefit flowing from collection of the tax.\n In its second position the respondent attempts to meet what has been said as to the inequity of its retaining the full price, when it escapes paying the tax, with the argument that the result is inevitable under the contracts. It refers to the fact that it had already obtained an injunction against the collection of the processing tax when some of the 1935 contracts were made and asserts that if the Government desired to provide against a decision that the taxing act was unconstitutional this could readily have been done by the addition of a single phrase.\n As we have said, there is respectable authority for the position that tax clauses in private contracts do not reach a judicial decision of invalidity of the statute. We think, however, these decisions have no application in the present instance. Here legislation recognizing the decision in United States v. Butler, supra, and imposing taxes on the enrichment of those who passed on the amount of the tax without having to pay it, may properly be said to have been a change of the tax by Congress within the terms of the contracts.\n The decision in the Butler case was rendered January 6, 1936. It is true that after that decision a taxpayer's right to an injunction against the collection of the tax \n\n[314 \nU.S. 212, 218]\n\u00a0\n was clear. \n9\n But, by the Revenue Act of 1936,10 which became a law June 22, 1936, Congress not only recongized the effect of that decision as doing away with the tax in question but legislated with respect to the consequent rights and remedies of those who had paid the tax and the liability of those who had passed on its burden and escaped payment.\n By Title III a tax is laid on the unjust enrichment consequent upon the passing on to customers the burden of unpaid processing taxes. In  501(b), (i)(2) and (j)(2) Congress defines the date of termination of the tax as 'in the case of a Federal excise tax held invalid by a decision of the Supreme Court, the date of such decision.' In Title IV there is a provision relative to floor stock taxes which recognizes the invalidity of the Agricultural Adjustment Act by reenacting the refund provisions of that Act in respect of transactions prior to January 6, 1936, the date of the Butler decision.  601(a), 7 U.S.C.A.  641(a) The title defines a taxable commodity as one on which a processing tax was provided for as of January 5, 1936, the day before the Butler decision.  602(c)(1), 7 U.S.C. A.  642(c)(1)\n Title VII, 7 U.S.C.A.  623 note, 644 et seq. makes provision for the refund of processing taxes collected under the Agricultural Adjustment Act and is a recognition by Congress that the taxes were invalid.\n Thus a change in respondent's tax liability has been recognized and confirmed by Congress. Even though this legislative action was a confirmation of or acquiescence in the Butler decision, and although its effect may have been merely cumulative, it amounted to a change made by Congress in respondent's liability for the tax, within the meaning of the contracts.\n The judgment is reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.C.Supp. V, Tit. 7,  609, 7 U.S.C.A.  609. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] United States v.

PELZER(1941)\nNo. 393\nArgued: January 7, 1941Decided: March 3, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Sol. Gen., and Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert A. Littleton, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Decision in this case turns on the question whether certain gifts of property in trust for the benefit of several beneficiaries are gifts of 'future interests' which, in the computation of the gift tax, are, by  504(b) of the 1932 Revenue Act, 47 Stat. 169, 247, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 585, denied the benefit, otherwise allowed, of exclusion from the compu- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n tation to the extent of the first $5,000 of each gift 'made to any person by the donor' during the calendar year.\n Sections 501(a) and 502(1) of the 1932 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts., page 580, impose for each calendar year a tax upon the net amount of transfers 'by any individual ... of property by gift'. For the purpose of computing the tax  504(b) provides 'In the case of gifts (other than of future interests in property) made to any person by the donor during the calendar year, the first $5,000 of such gifts ... shall not ... be included in the total amount of gifts made during such year'.\n In 1932 the taxpayer, respondent here, created a trust for the benefit of his eight grandchildren and any other grandchildren who might afterward be born during the term of the trust. The trustee was directed to accumulate the income for a period of ten years and thereafter to pay an 'equal grandchild's distributive share' of the income to each of the named grandchildren who were then living and twenty-one years of age and to pay a like share of income to each other named grandchild for life after that child should reach the age of twenty-one years. Provision was made whereby grandchildren born after the creation of the trust and during its life were to receive like participation in the income of the trust except as to distributions of income made prior to the birth of such after- born grandchildren, and except that the after-born grandchildren should be paid their shares of the income during their respective minorities after the termination of the ten-year accumulation period. The trust instrument also made gifts over of the share of the income of each grandchild at death, the details of which are not now material. It was further provided that the trust should terminate twenty-one years after death of the last survivor of the named grandchildren, when the corpus of the trust, with accumulated income, was to be distributed in equal shares among \n\n[312 \nU.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n the surviving grandchildren and the issue per stirpes of the deceased grandchildren.\n During the years 1933, 1934, and 1935, the taxpayer added further amounts of property to the 1932 trust. In 1934 he also made gifts directly to his three granddaughters and created a trust to pay the income in equal shares to his wife and three daughters with gifts over of each share of the corpus of the trust upon the death of the life tenant.\n Upon claims for refunds of overpaid taxes upon the transfers made in the years 1933, 1934, and 1935, the commissioner recomputed the tax and allowed one $5,000 exclusion only from the net amounts subject to gift tax given or added in each year to each trust. In the present suit, brought in the Court of Claims, respondent sought to recover overpaid taxes for the years in question on the grounds that the gifts to the beneficiaries were gifts of present not future interests and that the taxpayer in the computation of the tax for each year was entitled to one exclusion of $5, 000 for each beneficiary. The court sustained both contentions and gave judgment for respondent accordingly. 31 F.Supp. 770. We granted certiorari October 21, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 634\n, 61 S.Ct. 65, 85 L.Ed. --, to resolve the conflict of the decision below with that of the Seventh Circuit in Ryerson v. United States, 114 F.2d 150.\n The Government challenges both grounds of decision below. It argues that only a single $5,000 exclusion is allowable under  504(b) from the total gifts made to the trust in each calendar year and that if the gifts are deemed to be made to the named beneficiaries of the trust no deduction can be allowed in the case of gifts to the 1932 trust because they were of future interests for which no exclusion is allowed by  504(b).\n We have this day decided the first question, in Helvering v. Hutchings, \n312 \nU.S. 393\n, 61 S.Ct. 653, 85 L.Ed. --, in which we held that in the case of gifts in trust the beneficiaries are the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n persons to whom the gifts are made and that for purposes of computation of the tax  504(b) excludes the first $5,000 in value of the gift to each beneficiary from the taxable amount of the gifts made in the calendar year. For the reasons stated in our opinion in that case we hold that the first beneficiaries of the trusts in this case are the persons to whom the gifts were made and that the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of the $5,000 exclusion for each gift to such beneficiary if it is not of a future interest.\n But the Government argues here, as it did below, that the gifts to the beneficiaries of the 1932 trust are of future interests within the meaning of the statute and treasury regulations. While the eight named grandchildren are the first beneficiaries of the trust, and the persons to whom the gifts were made, none of them takes any benefit from the trust before the end of the ten-year accumulation period or until he is twenty- one, whichever last occurs, and then only if he survives that event. And the question is whether such a gift is a gift of a 'future interest' within the meaning of  504(b). Respondent, relying on statutes and judicial decisions of Alabama, where the trust was created and is being administered, insists that the gifts to the named grandchildren are present not future interests as defined by Alabama law. He argues that as  504(b) does not define the 'future interests' gifts of which are excluded from its benefits, they must be taken to be future interests as defined by the local law, and it is the local law definition of future interests which must be adopted in applying the section. But as we have often had occasion to point out, the revenue laws are to be construed in the light of their general purpose to establish a nationwide scheme of taxation uniform in its application. Hence their provisions are not to be taken as subject to state control or limitation unless the language or necessary implication of the sec- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n tion involved makes its application dependent on state law. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77; Morgan v. Commissioner, \n309 \nU.S. 78, 81\n, 60 S.Ct. 424, 426.\n We find no such implication in the exclusion of gifts of 'future interests' from the benefits given by  504(b). In the absence of any statutory definition of the phrase we look to the purpose of the statute to ascertain what is intended. It plainly is not concerned with the varying local definitions of property interests or with the local refinements of conveyancing, and there is no reason for supposing that the extent of the granted tax exemption was intended to be given a corresponding variation. Its purpose was rather the protection of the revenue and the appropriate administration of the tax immunity provided by the statute. It is this purpose which marks the boundaries of the statutory command. The committee reports recommending the legislation declared (H.Rept. No. 708, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29; S.Rept. No. 665, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 41):\n'The term 'future interests in property' refers to any interest or estate, whether vested or contingent, limited to commence in possession or enjoyment at a future date. The exemption being available only in so far as the donees are ascertainable, the denial of the exemption in the case of gifts of future interests is dictated by the apprehended difficulty, in many instances, of determining the number of eventual donees and the values of their respective gifts.'\n\n Article XI of Treasury Regulation 79, 1933 and 1936 editions, interpreting  504(b), declared that 'future interests' include any interest or estate 'whether vested or contingent, limited to commence in use, possession or enjoyment at some future date or time'. This definition stands unchanged in the regulations and while  504(b) was amended by  505 of the 1938 Revenue Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 1139, so as to withdraw the benefit of the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n $5,000 exclusion from all gifts in trust the section as amended continues to withhold the benefit of the exclusion from all gifts of 'future interests in property'.\n We think that the regulations, so far as they are applicable to the present gifts, are within the competence of the Treasury in interpreting  504(b) and effect its purpose as declared by the reports of the Congressional committees, and that the gifts to the eight beneficiaries of the 1932 trust were gifts of future interests which are excluded from the benefits of that section. Here the beneficiaries had no right to the present enjoyment of the corpus or of the income and unless they survive the ten-year period they will never receive any part of either. The 'use, possession or enjoyment' of each donee is thus postponed to the happening of a future uncertain event. The gift thus involved the difficulties of determining the 'number of eventual donees and the value of their respective gifts' which it was the purpose of the statute to avoid.\n We have no occasion to consider the definition of future interests in other aspects than those presented by the present case. The judgment of the Court of Claims will be reversed so far only as it excluded the gifts to the 1932 trust from the computation of the tax for each of the years in question.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Gartner, of Washington, D.C., for respondents. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 127, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether upon this record the Court of Claims1 committed error in concluding that respondents, as executors, were, in computing their federal income tax, entitled to deduct expenses properly incurred in the administration of an estate, Congress having provided that such a deduction could be taken only by individuals, estates, or trusts engaged in 'carrying on ... business.' Revenue Act of 1934,  23(a), 161, 162, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(a)(1), 161, 162. Compare City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Helvering, just announced, \n313 \nU.S. 121\n, 61 S.Ct. 896, 85 L.Ed. --.\n In computing the 1934 net income of the estate, respondents claimed a deduction of $40,000 for fees paid to the estate's attorney during the taxable year. The Com- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 127, 129]\n\u00a0\n missioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction; the respondents paid under protest, and filed suit for refund in the Court of Claims. Their complaint alleged that 'The payment of attorney's fees and the claim for allowance thereof as a deduction from gross income is predicated upon the contention that the tremendous size of the corpus of the estate and the proper administration thereof constituted the operation of a business and the employment of an attorney as counsel to guide the executors in the handling of the affairs of the estate was just as much a necessary expense of the estate as is incurred in the operation of any commercial business engaged in the manufacturing or selling of commodities.' The court made detailed findings of fact, and as its single conclusion of law stated that the respondents should recover.\n We recently stated in Higgins v. Commissioner, \n312 \nU.S. 212\n, 61 S.Ct. 475, 85 L.Ed. --, that determination of what amounts to carrying on business requires examination of the facts in each case. In this case, the record before us contains the findings of the Court of Claims, a conclusion of law, and an opinion summarizing the findings of fact and indicating the reasons which prompted the court to reach its conclusion of law. The most that can be said of the findings of fact is that the court was of the opinion that the facts found showed that the activities of the executors were such as to meet certain criteria set out in the opinion as determinative of what constituted carrying on business. For what the court found as a fact was that the decedent, prior to his death 'was engaged in business as a financier and investor, maintaining an office where he employed an office manager and an average of six clerks. ... In general the operations of the estate continued in substantially the same manner after the decedent's death as before ....' (35 F.Supp. 83.) In addition the court found that the attorney employed by the executors 'was called upon to advise them with reference to mat- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n ters both legal and economic that arose in the business activities of the estate, with reference to federal estate and state inheritance taxes, and also in regard to the acquisition and disposal of the estate's securities and in regard to various matters pertaining to companies in which the estate held investments.' But the executors might do all the things that the court found that they did and still not be engaged in 'carrying on ... business' within the meaning of the Revenue Act. For as we said in the Higgins case, 'All expenses of every business transaction are not deductible. Only those are deductible which relate to carrying on a business.' Also, we there sustained a holding that an individual who was engaged in financial and investing activities in all ways similar to those of the decedent and his executors in this case was not entitled to a deduction such as that sought by respondents. Therefore, the finding of the Court of Claims that the executors continued to conserve the decedent's estate as he had when he was himself 'a financier and investor' falls far short of a finding that the executors were entitled to a deduction accorded by Congress only to those 'carrying on ... business.' Failure of the Court of Claims to make a specific finding on this ultimate and determinative issue deprives that court's judgment of support. Under such circumstances we are not called upon to weigh the different facts set out in the subsidiary findings in order to determine whether or not they would support a conclusion that the executors were 'carrying on ... business' within the meaning of the statute. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n When we turn to the opinion of the Court of Claims,3 it is made clear that absence of such a specific finding \n\n[313 \nU.S. 127, 131]\n\u00a0\n was the result of the court's adoption of criteria of 'carrying on ... business' inconsistent with our holding in the Higgins case. Since the judgment must be vacated because not supported by adequate findings, it is appropriate that we point out this inconsistency. Accepting as true the statement of the Court of Claims that a broad definition of 'business' might be that it is 'whatever engages the time, attention, and labor of men in order to conserve what they have or to avoid loss' it does not follow at all that this is synonymous with the statutory language, 'carrying on ... business.' This definition of 'business' stems in part from the case of Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 171\n, 31 S.Ct. 342, 357, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312, upon which the Court of Claims relied. But however applicable that definition may have been to the case there under consideration, it cannot be accepted as a guide in the present case. The reasons why it is not applicable to the statutory provision now under consideration were given in our opinion in the Higgins case; its non- applicability to specific situations has also been explained in a number of other opinions of this C urt. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Nor can the judgment of the Court of Claims be supported by that court's statement that the executors were engaged 'in the business of conserving the estate and protecting its income.' Such activities are the traditional duty of executors. Executors who engage actively in trade and business are the exception and not the rule. Rather obviously, there could be clear cases where executors 'carry on ... business' by continuing to operate a store, a factory or some other well known, well marked type of business activity. But in the absence of evidence showing activities coming within the general acceptation of the concept of carrying on a trade or business, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n it cannot be said as a matter of law that an executor comes into this category merely because he conserves the estate by marshalling and gathering the assets as a mere conduit for ultimate distribution. And determination of what constitutes 'carrying on ... business' under the Revenue Act does not depend upon the size of the estate or the number of people whose services are required in order properly to conserve it.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is vacated and the cause is remanded to that court for proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed. It is so ordered.\n Judgment vacated and cause remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 F.Supp. 81. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] United States v.

Rasquin, \n312 \nU.S. 254\n, 61 S.Ct. 507, 85 L.Ed. --, decided this day. Consequently the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals holding that cash-surrender value on the dates of the gifts was the proper method of valuing single-premium life insurance policies for gift-tax purposes (7 Cir., 114 F.2d 150) must be reversed, unless the elapse of time between the issuance of the policies and the making of the gifts calls for a different result. The single-premium policies here involved were taken out by the insured in 1928 and 1929. They were assigned as gifts in December, 1934, when the insured was 79 years old. The cost of the policies was less than their cash-surrender value at the dates of the gifts. But the cost of replacing the policies at the then age of the insured would have been in excess of their cash-surrender value. We think that such cost of replacement, as held by the District Court, is the best available criterion of the value of the policies for the purposes of the gift tax. The elapse of time between issuance and assignment of the policies does not justify the substitution of cash-surrender value for replacement cost as the criterion of value. We cannot assume with respondents that at the dates of the gifts the policies presumably had no insurance, as distinguished from investment value to the donor. Here, as in the case where the issuance of the policies and their assignment as gifts are simultaneous, cash-surrender value reflects only a part of the value of the contracts. The cost of dupli- cating the policies at the dates of the gifts is in absence of more cogent evidence the one criterion which reflects both their insurance and investment value to the owner at that time. Cf. Vance on \n\n[312 \nU.S. 260, 262]\n\u00a0\n Insurance, 2d Ed., pp. 332, 333; Speer v. Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co., 36 Hun. 322. The fact that the then condition of an insured's health might make him uninsurable emphasizes the conclusion that the use of that criterion will result in placing a minimum value upon such a gift.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Kaplan, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Milton U. Copland, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The New York Supreme Court, acting under authority of  795 of the New York Civil Practice Act, made an order authorizing respondent, as a judgment creditor, to maintain a suit under the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 505,  24(20) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), to recover damages from the United States for breach of its contract with the judgment debtor. The question for decision is whether a United States District Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\n The order authorized respondent, who had recovered a judgment against Kaiser in the New York Supreme Court for $5,567.22, to bring suit against the Government to recover for breach of its contract with Kaiser for the construction of a post office building. The order \n\n[312 \nU.S. 584, 586]\n\u00a0\n directed that out of the amount recovered respondent should be entitled to a sum sufficient to satisfy his judgment with interest 'as well as costs, disbursements and expenses which may be allowed by the court'.\n Respondent brought the present suit against the United States and Kaiser in the District Court for Eastern New York. By his complaint he set up the judgment and the order of the state court, the breach of contract by the United States, and the consequent damage to Kaiser in the sum of $ 14,448.49, and prayed judgment in the sum of $10,000. The order of the District Court dismissing the complaint for want of jurisdiction was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 112 F.2d 587, which held that under Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, respondent's 'capacity to sue' was governed by the law of New York which was his domicile; and that the order of the state court had conferred authority upon respondent to maintain the suit, the United States being a 'person indebted' within the meaning of  795 of the Civil Practice Act which sanctions orders by the state court authorizing a suit by a judgment creditor against a 'person ... indebted to the judgment debtor.'

Jurisdiction to entertain suits against the United States to recover damages for breach of contract and certain other specified classes of claims was conferred on the Court of Claims by Act of February 24, 1855, 10 Stat. 612. With additions not now material, the jurisdiction was continued by paragraph First of the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 505, which, as supplemented and re-enacted, is now  145 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  250, 28 U.S.C.A.  250. Section 2 which, as supplemented and re-enacted, is now  24(20) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S. C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), confers jurisdiction on the district courts 'Concurrent with the Court of Claims, of all claims not exceeding $ 10,000 founded ... upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect to which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable ....'\n The Court of Claims is a legislative, not a constitutional court. Its judicial power is derived not from the Judiciary Article of the Constitution, article 3, but from the Congressional power 'to pay the debts ... of the United States', article 1,  8, cl. 1, which it is free to exercise through judicial as well as non-judicial agencies. See Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553, 569\n, 579 S., 53 S.Ct. 751, 756, 759; Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 452\n, 49 S.Ct. 411, 413, et seq. It is for this reason, and because of the power of the sovereign to attach conditions to its consent to be sued, that Congress, despite the Seventh Amendment, may dispense with a jury trial in suits brought in the Court of Claims.

Luckenbach Steamship Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 536\n, 47 S.Ct. 186, 187, et seq. For that reason it has been uniformly held, upon a review of the statutes creating the court and defining its authority, that its jurisdiction is confined to the rendition of money judgments in suits brought for that relief against the United States, United States a. Alire, 6 Wall. 573; United States v. Jones, \n131 \nU.S. 1\n, 9 S.Ct. 669, and if the relief sought is against others than the United States the suit as to them must be ignored as beyond the jurisdiction of the court. United States v. Jones, supra; Lynn v. United States, 5 Cir., 110 F.2d 586, 588; Leather & Leigh v. United States, 61 Ct.Cl. 388, or if its maintenance against private parties is prerequisite to prosecution of the suit against the United States the suit must be dismissed. Jackson v. United States, 27 Ct.Cl. 74, 84; Waite v. United States, 57 Ct.Cl. 546; Leather & Leigh v. United States, supra; cf. Turner's Case, Turner v. Creek Nation of Indians, \n248 \nU.S. 354\n, 39 S.Ct. 109; Green v. Menominee Tribe, \n233 \nU.S. 558\n, 34 S.Ct. 706. See Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 44 F.2d 887, 888.\n We think it plain that the present suit could not have been maintained in the Court of Claims because that court is without jurisdiction of any suit brought against private parties and because adjudication of the right or capacity of respondent to proceed with the suit upon the contract of the judgment debtor with the United States is prerequisite to any recovery upon the Government contract. As the court below recognized, the judgment debtor, who is made a necessary party by  795 of the Civil Practice Act, in any suit brought pursuant to the order of the state court is entitled to attack the validity of the order and of the judgment on which it \n\n[312 \nU.S. 584, 589]\n\u00a0\n is founded. See Nankivel v. Omsk All Russian Government, 237 N.Y. 150, 158, 142 N.E. 569. Adjudication of that issue is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims whose authority, as we have seen, is narrowly restricted to the adjudication of suits brought against the Government alone.\n But the question remains whether such a suit is nevertheless within the jurisdiction conferred by the Tucker Act on the district courts. The Court of Appeals thought that the obstacles to joining private parties, as parties defendant, in suits against the Government are procedural only, and that while no procedure is provided whereby the Court of Claims can adjudicate the rights of private parties in suits against the Government, that court is nevertheless free to adopt such a procedure. Cf. 28 U.S.C.  263, 28 U.S.C.A.  263. In any case it thought such procedure has now been made applicable to suits in the district courts by the new rules of civil practice. It concluded that since the District Court, under the Tucker Act has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the United States and by virtue of other provisions of the Judicial Code has jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues between respondent and the judgment debtor, the Rules of Civil Procedure authorize the exercise of both jurisdictions in a single suit.\n This conclusion presupposes that the United States, either by the rules of practice or by the Tucker Act or both, has given its consent to be sued in litigations in which issues between the plaintiff and third persons are to be adjudicated. But we think that nothing in the new rules of civil practice so far as they may be applicable in suits brought in district courts under the Tucker Act authorizes the maintenance of any suit against the United States to which it has not otherwise consented. An authority conferred upon a court to make rules of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 584, 590]\n\u00a0\n procedure for the exercise of its jurisdiction is not an authority to enlarge that jurisdiction and the Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 28 U.S.C.  723b, 28 U.S.C.A.  723b, authorizing this Court to prescribe rules of procedure in civil actions gave it no authority to modify, abridge or enlarge the substantive rights of litigants or to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of federal courts.\n Nor with due regard to the words of  2 of the Tucker Act and to its legislative history can we say that the United States has consented to the maintenance of suits against the Government in the district courts which could not be maintained in the Court of Claims. The section must be interpreted in the light of its function in giving consent of the Government to be sued, which consent, since it is a relinquishment of a sovereign immunity, must be strictly interpreted. Schillinger v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 163\n, 15 S.Ct. 85; Price v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 373\n, 19 S.Ct. 765; United States v. Michel, \n282 \nU.S. 656\n, 51 S.Ct. 284; United States v. Shaw, \n309 \nU.S. 495\n, 60 S.Ct. 659; United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n309 \nU.S. 506\n, 60 S.Ct. 653; cf. Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, \n309 \nU.S. 242, 247\n, 60 S.Ct. 488, 491. Section 2, authorizing suits against the Government in district courts, is an integral part of the statute, other sections of which revised and enlarged the classes of claims against the United States which could be litigated in the Court of Claims. It was the jurisdiction thus defined and established for that court which was extended by the section to the district courts in the specified instances, for in consenting to suits against the Government in the district courts, Congress prescribed that the jurisdiction thus conferred should be 'concurrent' with that of the Court of Claims.\n Construing the statutory language with that conservatism which is appropriate in the case of a waiver of sovereign immunity and in the light of the history of the \n\n[312 \nU.S. 584, 591]\n\u00a0\n Court of Claims' jurisdiction to which we have referred, we think that the Tucker Act did no more than authorize the District Court to sit as a court of claims and that the authority thus given to adjudicate claims against the United States does not extend to any suit which could not be maintained in the Court of Claims. See United States v. Jones, supra, \n131 \nU.S. 19\n, 9 S.Ct. 671; United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547, 550\n, 41 S.Ct. 569, 570; cf. Bates Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 567, 571\n, 58 S.Ct. 694, 696. The matter is not one of procedure but of jurisdiction whose limits are marked by the Government's consent to be sued. That consent may be conditioned, as we think it has been here, on the restriction of the issues to be adjudicated in the suit, to those between the claimant and the Government. The jurisdiction thus limited is unaffected by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, which prescribe the methods by which the jurisdiction of the federal courts is to be exercised, but do not enlarge the jurisdiction.\n The present litigation well illustrates the embarrassments which would attend the defense of suits brought against the Government if the jurisdiction of district courts were not deemed to be as restricted as is that of the Court of Claims. The Government, to protect its interests, must not only litigate the claim upon which it has consented to be sued, but must make certain that respondent's right, as against the judgment debtor, to maintain the suit is properly adjudicated. And since the alleged claim for damages is larger than the $10,000 jurisdictional amount the Government must either be subjected to successive suits for partial recoveries of the amount due or must make certain that respondent has legal authority to relinquish the judgment debtor's claim in excess of $10, 000, and that this has been accomplished by the limitation of his demand for judgment to that amount. See Franklin v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 516\n, 60 S.Ct. 170; Otis Elevator \n\n[312 \nU.S. 584, 592]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. United States, D.C., 18 F.Supp. 87. The Government's consent to litigate such issues is hardly to be inferred from its consent to be sued upon a claim for damages for breach of contract. Cf. National Surety Co. v. Washington Iron Works, D.C., 243 F. 260.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVANDENBARK v. OWENS-ILLINOIS GLASS CO.(1941)\nNo. 141\nArgued: December 13, 1940Decided: January 6, 1941\n\n\n\n Messrs. Paul D. Smith and Thomas H. Sutherland, both of Marion, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Lawrence E. Broh-Kahn, of Toledo, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certiorari brings before us for review the determination of the Circuit Court of Appeals that cases at law sounding in tort, brought in the federal courts on the ground of diversity of citizenship, are ruled by the state law as declared by the state's highest court when the judgment of the trial court is entered and not by the state law as so declared at the time of entry of the appellate court's order of affirmance or reversal. We granted the certiorari because of the uncertainty of the law upon this question as contained in this Court's former decisions. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 538, 539]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner here, Virginia Vandenbark, the plaintiff below, is a citizen of Arizona. The defendant, respondent here, the Owens-Illinois Glass Company, is a corporation of Ohio. Petitioner brought an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio alleging that as an employee of respondent she had contracted various occupational diseases including silicosis through the negligence of respondent. The trial court sustained a motion to dismiss on the ground that the petition failed to state a cause of action. This ruling was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals with the statement that under the law of Ohio no recovery was permitted, at the time of the judgment in the trial court, for the type of occupational disease alleged by the petitioner to have been contracted by her as the result of respondent's negligence. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It is conceded that at the time the motion to dismiss was sustained neither the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Act2 nor the common law, as interpreted by the supreme court of that state, gave a right of recovery to petitioner. The Constitution of Ohio3 authorized the passing of laws establishing a state fund out of which compensation for death injuries or occupational diseases was to paid employees in lieu of all other rights to compensation or damages from any employer who complied with the law. At the time of the dismissal of the petition by the trial court no provision had been made by statute for any of the occupational diseases included in petitioner's complaint. Respondent had fully complied with the Workmen's Compensation Act. The Ohio Constitution and compensation statutes passed pursuant to its authority had been consistently construed by the Ohio courts as \n\n[311 \nU.S. 538, 540]\n\u00a0\n withdrawing the common-law right and as denying any statutory right to recovery for petitioner's occupational diseases. \n4\n After the action of the trial court in dismissing the petition, the Ohio supreme court reversed its former decisions and, in an opinion expressly overruling them, declared occupational diseases such as complained of by petitioner compensable under Ohio common law. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n While Erie Railroad v. Tompkins6 made the law of the state, as declared by its highest court, effective to govern tort cases cognizable in federal courts on the sole ground of diversity, there was no necessity there for discussing at what step in the cause the state law would be finally determined. In that case no change occurred in the state decisions between the accident and our judgment. There is nothing in the Rules of Decision section to point the way to a solution. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n During the period when Swift v. Tyson8 (1842-1938) ruled the decisions of the federal courts, its theory of their freedom in matters of general law from the authority of state courts pervaded opinions of this Court involving even state statutes or local law. As a consequence some decisions hold that a different interpretation of state law by state courts after a decision in a fed- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 538, 541]\n\u00a0\n eral trial court does not require the federal reviewing court to reverse the trial court. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n In Burgess v. Seligman, cited in the preceding note, a statute of Missouri relating to the liability of stockholders of a Missouri corporation was interpreted by the state supreme court contrary to the prior decision of the federal trial court. This Court affirmed the trial court, saying 'So, when contracts and transactions have been entered into, and rights have accrued thereon under a particular state of the decisions, or when there has been no decision of the state tribunals, the federal courts properly claim the right to adopt their own interpretation of the law applicable to the case, although a different interpretation may be adopted by the state courts after such rights have accrued.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n What we conceive, however, to be the true rule to guide a federal appellate court where there has been a change of decision in state courts subsequent to the judgment of the district court was stated, before any of the opinions just cited, in United States v. Schooner Peggy. \n11\n The Court there said 'It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if, subsequent to the judgment, and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied.' \n\n[311 \nU.S. 538, 542]\n\u00a0\n It is true this Court was speaking of the intervention of a treaty and also that it expressed a caution against retrospective operation between private parties but the principle quoted has found acceptance in a variety of situations. Kibbe v. Ditto12 and Moores v. Citizens' National Bank13 hold that subsequent decisions as to married women's rights control review. Sioux County v. National Surety Company14 gives effect to a later decision on a statute as to surety bonds. In Oklahoma Packing Company v. Oklahoma Gas Company,15 we applied as determinative a state decision, clarifying the local law, handed down after the decree then under consideration here.\n While cases were pending here on review, this Court has acted to give opportunity for the application by the lower courts of statutes enacted after their judgments or decrees. \n16\n It has vacated judgments of state courts because of contrary intervening decisions,17 and has accepted jurisdiction by virtue of statutes enacted after cases were pending before it. \n18\n Where, after judgment below, a declaration of war changed the standing of one litigant from an alien belligerent to an enemy, this Court took cognizance of the change and modified the action below because of the new status. \n19\n Similarly repeal of criminal laws or of a constitutional provision without a saving clause deprives appellate courts of jurisdiction to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 538, 543]\n\u00a0\n entertain further proceedings under their sanctions. \n20\n These instances indicate that the dominant principle is that nisi prius and appellate tribunals alike should conform their orders to the state law as of the time of the entry. Intervening and conflicting decisions will thus cause the reversal of judgments which were correct when entered.\n Respondent earnestly presses upon us the desirability of applying the rule that appellate courts will review a judgment only to determine whether it was correct when made; that any other review would make the federal courts subordinate to state courts and their judgments subject to changes of attitude or membership of state courts, whether that change was normal or induced for the purpose of affecting former federal rulings. While not insensible to possible complications, we are of the view that, until such time as a case is no longer sub judice, the duty rests upon federal courts to apply state law under the Rules of Decision statute in accordance with the then controlling decision of the highest state court. 21 Any other conclusion would but perpetuate the confusion and injustices arising from inconsistent federal and state interpretations of state law.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Vandenbark v.

Wright, of Columbus, Ohio, for respondents.[ Voeller v. Neilston Warehouse Co. \n311 \nU.S. 531\n (1941) ]\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 531, 533]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We granted certiorari in this case, \n311 \nU.S. 624\n, 61 S.Ct. 11, 85 L. Ed. --, to review a decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio invalidating a state statute on the ground that it constituted a denial of procedural due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1\n The statute in question provided that the value placed upon his stock by a dissenting shareholder should, after six months and under certain circumstances, 'conclusively be deemed to be equal to' the fair cash value. \n2\n The state court held that since the statute required that the demands of the dissenters be made known only to the corporation, the majority shareholders were unconstitutionally deprived of property without notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n Concretely, the question was raised here in the following manner: Petitioners, holders of stock in respondent corporation, were among those who dissented when a vote was called on a sale of substantially all the corporate assets. Two-thirds of the shareholders voted for the sale, which was thereupon consummated. Petitioners gave written notice to the corporation of their objection, the number of shares they held, and the claimed fair cash value of their stock. The corporation refused in writing to pay the amount asked, but made no counter- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n offer. Neither party filed a petition for appraisal. After six months had elapsed, petitioners filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas, asking that judgment be rendered in their favor for the amounts originally claimed.\n All of these proceedings were in accordance with the applicable Ohio law. \n3\n In their suit, petitioners relied on a section of that law which provided that the value claimed by the dissenting shareholders should 'conclusively be deemed to be equal to' fair cash value if the corporation had neither made a counter-offer nor requested an appraisal. \n4\n One of the majority shareholders filed an intervening petition on behalf of herself and all other shareholders similarly situated, alleging that the section of the state involved was unconstitutional. A judge of the Court of Common Pleas struck out this intervention at the request of petitioners, saying that the statute was constitutional, the petition for intervention irrelevant, and the majority shareholders without standing to intervene. \n5\n No appeal was taken from this ruling. When the case came on for trial on the merits, a different judge sat, and it was his opinion that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the trial court, and was itself reversed, two judges dissenting, by the Supreme Court of Ohio. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n It was the opinion of the Supreme Court that the statute had 'an unconstitutional operation against the majority stockholders, as being violative of the due process section of the 14th Amendment to the federal Constitution.' And the correctness of that conclusion is the only question properly before this Court. All other questions presented involve state law, for the conditions under which corporations shall organize and operate are matters within the exclusive province of the state, so long as those conditions do not clash with the national Constitution.\n We agree with petitioner's position that notice to the corporation of the demand for payment constituted notice to the majority stockholders, and that such notice was an adequate compliance with the constitutional requirement of due process. The objective of the Ohio statute permitting the right of appraisal to dissenting shareholders was the elimination of abuses that had long been a fixture in the field of corporate finance. \n6\n To assure that the right to appraisal would be promptly resorted to and to provide for the contingency that in some cases no such resort would be taken, the Ohio legislature thought it advisable to provide that under some circumstances the original offer or counter-offer should \n\n[311 \nU.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n conclusively be deemed equal to the fair cash value. The corporation was given the right to avoid the effect of being compelled to pay the claimed value either by making a counter-offer or by requesting an appraisal. In addition, it was given the right to avoid both appraisal and payment of the claimed value by abandoning its original purpose to sell its assents. The dissenting shareholders could, by requesting an appraisal, likewise avoid accepting the corporation's counter-offer. Thus the corporation is compelled to pay or the dissenting shareholder to accept payment of the amount of the offer or counter-offer only if none of the many available alternatives are pursued before the expiration of a six-month period. The provisions in effect operate as statutes of limitations. After the lapse of a period of time, given defenses-attacks on value-can no longer be asserted.\n It is true, as respondent urges, that after the majority authorizes the corporation to effect a sale, the alternatives are thereafter expressly open only to the corporation and the dissenters; no provision is made for notice to the majority shareholders as individuals. But the majority, by their vote approving the sale of assets, have indicated their intention to remain part and parcel of the corporation; the dissenters, on the other hand, by voting against the sale and by demanding payment, have indicated an intention to sever relationships. If thereafter the failure of the directors to make a counter-offer materially prejudices the financial stake of the majority, it is no more a want of due process to consider the majority bound thereby than it is to consider them bound by any other act of management. The majority are participants in a corporate enterprise. In entrusting their capital to the corporation, they accept the disadvantages of the corporate system along with its advantages. What is claimed to be a disadvantage here is a necessary con- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n comitant of the system and its most distinctive attribute-representation of the collective interest of shareholders by selected corporate management.\n The constitutional issue is here raised for the majority shareholders by the corporation, which admittedly itself had notice. Exercising the very delicate responsibility of passing upon the validity of state statutes, this Court has many times declared the rule that only those who have been injured as the result of the denial of constitutional rights can invoke our jurisdiction on constitutional questions. \n7\n Yet here the corporation would have us say that it is sufficiently the representative of the majority to raise in their behalf the constitutional issue, but not sufficiently their representative to receive notice. We hold that, so far as the constitutional requirement of due process is concerned, it is in this case sufficiently their representative for both purposes, and accordingly we find it necessary to reverse the judgment below. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n There is nothing unusual in such a holding; the rights of parties are habitually protected in court by those who act in a representative capacity; an executor or administrator may act for the beneficiaries of an estate; a receiver may represent the collective interests of stockholders, partners, or creditors; a lawyer may appear for his clients; and a corporation may represent the collective interests of its shareholders. In this case, in fact, the unappealed ruling of the trial judge on the attempted intervention by the majority stands as an adjudication that in those respects here material the majority had committed their interests to the corporation itself.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 136 Ohio St. 427, 26 N.E.2d 442, 445. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ohio Code Ann.

This made it possible for an arbitrary minority to establish a nuisance value for its shares by refusal to cooperate. To meet the situation, legislatures authorized the making of changes by majority vote. This, however, opened the door to victimization of the minority. To solve the dilemma, statutes permitting a dissenting minority to recover the appraised value of its shares, were widely adopted. See S.E.C. Report on the Work of Protective and Reorganization Committees, Part VII, pp. 557, 590. The Ohio appraisal statute here in issue was not adopted until after respondent had acquired its charter, but the Ohio Constitution expressly reserves to the state the right to alter or repeal the corporate law.

Johnston \n312 \nU.S. 275\n (1941) ]\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Herbert Wechsler, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents important questions of practice touching the issue of the writ of habeas corpus. We accordingly granted certiorari in forma pauperis, \n311 \nU.S. 635\n, 61 S.Ct. 68, 85 L.Ed. --, and appointed counsel for the petitioner to insure adequate presentation at our bar.\n The petitioner, who is confined in the Federal prison at Alcatraz, California, under sentence and commitment of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n the District Court for Northern Texas upon a plea of guilty to an indictment charging armed robbery of a national bank, sought habeas corpus in the District Court for Northern California. His petition recites that he was indicted in the District Court for Northern Texas March 9, 1936; that the cause came on for trial April 28, 1936, and he pleaded guilty; that he was sentenced May 1, 1936, to twelve years' imprisonment, was committed to the penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, May 4, 1936, and is now confined at Alcatraz. The petition alleges that at trial the petitioner was without the assistance of counsel; that he did not waive his right to counsel; that the court did not inquire whether he desired counsel or instruct him that he was entitled to counsel; that he did not know he was so entitled if he had no money to pay an attorney; and that the judgment of conviction is void, as he was deprived of the assistance of counsel for his defence in violation of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution. The prayer is that the writ issue and that he be released from custody.\n The court issued an order to show cause addressed to the warden of the penitentiary. That officer filed a return showing that he held the prisoner under a commitment issued by the Texas District Court and a transfer from Leavenworth to Alcatraz ordered by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons of the Department of Justice. Attached to the return were certified copies of the indictment, minute entries, sentence, and commitment, and docket entries in the cause, transfer order, and record of commitment. Also attached were affidavits of the United States Attorney, the Assistant United States Attorney, and the Probation Officer (formerly a deputy marshal) of the Northern District of Texas. These affiants, or some of them, deposed to the following effect: The petitioner was jointly indicted with one White, who pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted, and sentenced; \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n the petitioner had no counsel as he entered a plea of guilty. At the time of the commission of the offense for which the petitioner was indicted he was an escaped convict from the State Penitentiary of New Mexico and was brought thence for trial. On the day of the trial, the marshal brought him to the Federal building where the District Attorney talked to him; asked him whether he was guilty and he stated he was; asked him if he was going to plead guilty and he stated he was; asked him whether he had a lawyer and he stated he did not want an attorney as he thought an attorney would be of no value to him. The District Attorney explained to the petitioner that he thought the judge would give him greater consideration, if he was guilty, on his entering a plea of guilty. The petitioner was told his interviewers believed that if he would tell the judge the truth and testify in the case as to his accomplices that fact would be considered by the judge in passing sentence. The petitioner stated he would enter a plea of guilty but would not testify. He refused to say whether the co- defendant White was with him at the time of the robbery and said that he would prefer not to make a statement with respect to other facts in the case. One affiant stated his belief that petitioner told the judge in open court that he had no counsel and did not desire any as he was guilty and intended to plead guilty. Three witnesses identified the petitioner as being one of the men who entered the bank and there was no question of his guilt. After sentence, petitioner expressed his satisfaction at the length of sentence imposed. Some time later a letter was received from the petitioner thanking the District Attorney for what he had done for him.\n The petitioner answered, denying that he had stated to one or more of the affiants, or in the presence of one or more of them, that he was guilty or that he intended \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 281]\n\u00a0\n to plead guilty; that he did not want an attorney or felt that an attorney would be of no value to him. He alleged that he first learned he was to be prosecuted for the offense in question about April 26, 1936, when a deputy marshal took him from New Mexico to Texas; that, prior to trial, the District Attorney, in the presence of the deputy marshal, asked him to plead guilty and he replied that he intended to plead not guilty, whereupon the District Attorney exhibited to him pictures of the scene of the alleged crime and, by means of them and otherwise, sought to persuade him that he would be proved guilty; that the petitioner refused to talk further with the District Attorney at that time; that the District Attorney again visited him and the petitioner then requested that the trial be continued so that he could communicate with his relatives and try to obtain money to enable him to hire an attorney for his defense, but that the District Attorney advised him this was not possible and told him to plead guilty, warning him that he would be sentenced to twice as great a term if he did not so plead; that the petitioner had no relatives or friends near the scene of the trial other than his co- defendant White. He alleged that he requested the District Attorney to be permitted to talk to White or White's attorney, but the request was refused. In view of the District Attorney's warning, and in fear of a heavy prison term, he told the District Attorney he would plead guilty. The answer alleges that petitioner has no information and belief sufficient to enable him to answer the statement concerning his letter claimed to have been sent from the penitentiary and, therefore, denies the fact; denies that the petitioner stated to the judge that he did not desire counsel appointed for him or that he was pleading guilty because he was guilty; alleges that at no time was petitioner informed, did he know or believe \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 282]\n\u00a0\n that he was entitled to the assistance of counsel for his defense, and that at no time did anyone ask him if he desired the assistance of counsel nor did anyone offer to procure such assistance for him; avers that he was without money to pay for counsel and believed he could not obtain the assistance of counsel without money to pay a lawyer; asserts that he attended school to the fifth grade and had had no further schooling or education, was entirely unversed in the law and unable and unqualified to represent or act for himself in a criminal proceeding; that at no time was he asked to waive his right to the assistance of counsel nor did he by word or act state or indicate that he waived, or intended to waive, that right; denies his guilt and denies that the evidence produced at trial showed his guilt.\n Upon these pleadings the District Judge, after hearing argument, discharged the rule to show cause and dismissed the petition for the writ. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner contended in the Circuit Court of Appeals that the statute required the District Court to issue the writ and, upon his production in court, to hold a hearing on the issues made by the pleadings. The court found it unnecessary to pass on the contention, since it held 'another manner of proceeding' (that here followed by the District Court) was permissible under our decisions. It approved the summary disposition of the case on the pleadings and affidavits submitted, as the petitioner had been afforded an opportunity to submit by affidavit whatever he deemed material. It thought the District Court was justified in disbelieving the petitioner's allegations and, on the basis of such disbelief, discharging the rule and denying the petition. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 283]\n\u00a0\n The case presents these questions: (1) Was the District Court, on the filing of the petition, bound forthwith to issue the writ and have the petitioner produced in answer to it? (2) If the procedure followed by the District Court was permissible, and the pleadings raised issues of fact, should those issues have been resolved by testimony rather than upon affidavits? (3) Did the pleadings raise any material issue of fact?\n First. The statutes of the United States declare that the supreme court and the district courts shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus;2 that application for the writ shall be made to the court or justice or judge authorized to issue the same by complaint in writing, under oath, signed by the petitioner, setting forth the facts concerning his detention, in whose custody he is and by virtue of what claim or authority, if known. \n3\n The court or justice or judge 'shall forthwith award a writ of habeas corpus, unless it appears from the petition itself that the party is not entitled thereto.' The writ shall be directed to the person in whose custody the petitioner is detained. \n4\n The person to whom the writ is directed must certify to the court or judge the true cause of detention and, at the same time he makes his return, bring the body of the party before the judge who granted the writ. \n5\n When the writ is returned a day is to be set for the hearing, not exceeding five days thereafter, unless the petitioner requests a longer time. \n6\n The petitioner may deny the facts set forth in the return or may allege any other material facts, under oath. \n7\n The court or judge \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 284]\n\u00a0\n 'shall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts of the case, by hearing the testimony and arguments, and thereupon to dispose of the party as law and justice require.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n It will be observed that if, upon the face of the petition, it appears that the party is not entitled to the writ, the court may refuse to issue it. Since the allegations of such petitions are often inconclusive, the practice has grown up of issuing an order to show cause, which the respondent may answer. By this procedure the facts on which the opposing parties rely may be exhibited, and the court may find that no issue of fact is involved. In this way useless grant of the writ with consequent production of the prisoner and of witnesses may be avoided where from undisputed facts or from incontrovertible facts, such as those recited in a court record, it appears, as matter of law, no cause for granting the writ exists. On the other hand, on the facts admitted, it may appear that, as matter of law, the prisoner is entitled to the writ and to a discharge. This practice has long been followed by this court9 and by the lower courts. \n10\n It is a convenient one, deprives the petitioner of no substantial right, if the petition and traverse are treated, as we think they should be, as together constituting the application for the writ, and the return to the rule as setting up the facts thought to warrant its denial, and if issues of fact emerging from the pleadings are tried as required by the statute.\n Second. The District Court proceeded to adjudicate the petitioner's right to the writ upon the allegations of \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 285]\n\u00a0\n his petition and traverse and those of the return and accompanying affidavits. Thus the case was disposed of on ex parte affidavits and without the taking of testimony. The practice thus to dispose of applications for habeas corpus on matters of fact as well as of law has been followed in the Ninth and Tenth Circuits. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n In other circuits, if an issue of fact is presented, the practice appears to have been to issue the writ, have the petitioner produced, and hold a hearing at which evidence is received. \n12\n This is, we think, the only admissible procedure. Nothing less will satisfy the command of the statute that the judge shall proceed 'to determine the facts of the case, by hearing the testimony and arguments'. It is not a question what the ancient practice was at common law or what the practice was prior to 1867 when the statute from which R.S.  761 is derived was adopted by Congress. The question is what the statute requires.\n As we said in Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 466\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1024, 'Congress has expanded the rights of a petitioner for habeas corpus .... There being no doubt of the authority of the Congress to thus liberalize the common-law procedure on habeas corpus ... it results that under the sections cited a prisoner in custody ... may have a judicial inquiry ... into the very truth and sub- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 286]\n\u00a0\n stance of the causes of his detention ....' Such a judicial inquiry involves the reception of testimony, as the language of the statute shows.\n The Government properly concedes that if the petition, the return, and the traverse raise substantial issues of fact it is the petitioner's right to have those issues heard and determined in the manner the statute prescribes.\n Third. Did the pleadings present any material issue of fact? The Government says they did not. It urges that, construed most favorably to petitioner, the allegations of the petition and the traverse do not show that he was in appearent or actual need of counsel's aid; and do disclose that he voluntarily waived the right to counsel.\n Without repeating the allegations of the petition and traverse, which have been summarized above, we think it clear that, taken together, they overcome the presumption of regularity which the record of the trial imports and that, if the facts alleged were established by testimony to the satisfaction of the judge, they would support a conclusion that the petitioner desired the aid of counsel, and so informed the District Attorney, was ignorant of his right to such aid, was not interrogated as to his desire or informed of his right, and did not knowingly waive that right, and that, by the conduct of the District Attorney, he was deceived and coerced into pleading guilty when his real desire was to plead not guilty or at least to be advised by counsel as to his course. If he did not voluntarily waive his right to counsel,13 or if he was deceived or coerced by the prosecutor into entering a guilty plea,14 he was deprived of a constitutional right. On a hearing he would have the burden of sustaining his allegations by a preponderance of evidence. It is true that they are denied in the affidavits filed with the return \n\n[312 \nU.S. 275, 287]\n\u00a0\n to the rule, but the denials only serve to make the issues which must be resolved by evidence taken in the usual way. They can have no other office. The witnesses who made them must be subjected to examination ore tenus or by deposition as are all other witnesses. Not by the pleadings and the affidavits, but by the whole of the testimony, must it be determined whether the petitioner has carried his burden of proof and shown his right to a discharge.

Fraenkel and Edward I. Aronow, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. John T. Cahill, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is similar to Browder v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 335\n, 61 S. Ct. 599, 85 L.Ed. --, decided today. This petitioner also was indicted for the use of a passport for the purpose of entering the United States, which passport had been secured by false statements in the application for its issue. We granted certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 631\n, 61 S.Ct. 46, 85 L.Ed. --, because of the contention that this use of the passport was not prohibited by section 2, Title IX of the Act of June 15, 1917, 22 U.S.C.A.  220, and because of a conflict on a rule of evidence, referred to by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The false statements charged were with respect to petitioner's name, citizenship, place of birth and residence abroad and the use relied upon was the presentation of the passport to an immigration inspector. A jury convicted petitioner, a sentence of two years was imposed and that judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n As grounds for reversal petitioner urges (1) that the presentation of a wrongfully held passport to an immigration officer upon landing is not a use within the statute; (2) that the evidence of the use was insufficient to justify the submission of the case to the jury; and (3) that conviction was obtained by the use of admissions \n\n[312 \nU.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n before the crime, without corroboration, to establish necessary elements of the charge.\n Nothing need be added to the discussion in the Browder case of the illegality of this use. There are no marks of differentiation.\n Proof of Presentation.-Petitioner's argument that the proof of presentation of the passport was insufficient rests upon the testimony of the inspector, which was based on the manifest of United States citizens arriving on the S. S. Normandie on September 30, 1937. The manifest contains a list of names, accompanied by passport numbers and other information. Next to each name appears a check mark by the inspector. The list includes 'Robert Wiener,' the holder of passport No. 332207, which is the passport issued to petitioner. The inspector testified that he had no independent recollection of the arrival of this Robert Wiener, but that from looking at the manifest he could say that the passport had been presented to him, because 'it is my invariable practice when the number of the passport appears on the manifest to ask for that passport and have it shown to me ... by the passenger.' On cross examination the inspector stated that he himself did not make any writing on the manifest as to what the people showed him. This colloquy then occurred:\n'The Court: ... do you make any entry on the manifest when a man identifies himself as an American citizen?\n\n'The Witness: The whole manifest is of American citizens.\n\n'The Court: And when the man presented his passport what did you do?\n\n'The Witness: That check mark shows he was admitted as a United States citizen.\n\n'The Court: On a passport?\n\n'The Witness: Not necessarily.\n\n'The Court: Can you tell us whether he had a passport? \n\n[312 \nU.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n 'The Witness: From the fact the number of the passport appears there.\n\n'Q. And you checked-\n\n'Mr. Fowler: That is objected to.\n\n'Q. Did you check the information on the manifest with information in the passport? A. That is correct.'\n\n The petitioner asks reversal because of the answer 'Not necessarily,' contending this shows that the check mark did not inescapably indicate the presentation of a passport. The Government argues that the check mark was intended merely to show admission as a citizen and that the language does not nullify or indeed impugn the direct assertions of the inspector. We are clear that this testimony as a whole justified the submission to the jury at any rate and its conclusion that petitioner actually used his passport in securing admission to this country.\n Corroboration of Admissions.- The prosecution had the burden of proving that the passport was obtained by the use of false statements. As the trial court instructed the jury it might convict if any one of the statements charged in the indictment to be false was found false, it is necessary before affirmance is justified to decide whether there was adequate evidence to support the charge of falsity as to each of the statements. Petitioner contends that as to the allegedly false statements of American citizenship and no prior residence outside the United States, there was no proof of falsity except admissions to the contrary made by petitioner prior to the use of the passport. Such admissions, it is urged, require corroboration. This argument is drawn from the requirement of corroboration as to confessions after the crime. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[312 \nU.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n As a corollary, it is said that the corroboration must reach to each element of the corpus delicti. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n To establish that petitioner was not a citizen of the United States and that he had resided abroad, the Government relied on the following proof: The manifest of alien passengers of the S. S. Haverford, which arrived at Philadelphia on March 27, 1914, stated that Welwel Warszower, age 21, was a citizen or subject of Russia, whose last permanent residence was in Vikolsk, Russia, where his father lived; that he had never been in the United States before; and that he had been born in Radajenko, Russia. Although the officer who had examined Warszower on this occasion was dead, the boarding officer testified it was the practice to check all answers on the manifest with the alien personally before allowing him to enter. Three years later, on June 5, 1917, petitioner registered for the draft under the name 'William Weiner'; he stated he was an alien born in Russia on September 5, 1893, and a citizen or subject of Russia. Petitioner furnished the same information in a draft question-naire returned on December 31, 1917, where he also stated that he spoke Russian, that he arrived in this country at Philadelphia on March 28, 1914, on the S. S. Haverford, that his parents had not been naturalized, that he had not taken out first papers, and that he was willing to return to Russia and enter its military service. In 1932, preparatory to traveling abroad, petitioner applied for a reentry permit, which is required only of aliens. To support his application he showed the inspection card issued to him in 1914 upon his arrival in Philadelphia, and stated that he was born on September 5, 1893, at Kiev, Russia, which was his last permanent residence before his arrival in Philadelphia. The Government also showed that petitioner had never applied \n\n[312 \nU.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n for naturalization under his own name, or the names 'Weiner' or 'Wiener', which he on occasion used. In his 1936 application for a passport in the name of Robert William Wiener, petitioner submitted a certified transcript of an entry in the Atlantic City birth records that a person of that name was born there September 5, 1896, but at the trial the Government proved the entry a forgery.\n The rule requiring corroboration of confessions protects the administration of the criminal law against errors in convictions based upon untrue confessions alone. Where the inconsistent statement was made prior to the crime this danger does not exist. \n4\n Therefore we are of the view that such admissions do not need to be corroborated. They contain none of the inherent weaknesses of confessions or admissions after the fact. Cases in the circuits are cited by petitioner to the contrary. In Gulotta v. United States,5 the decision turned on the similarity of confessions and admissions rather than upon any differences between admissions before and after the fact. In Duncan v. United States6 and in Gordnier v. United States7 the conclusion was reached without any comment upon this difference. Our consideration of the effect of admissions prior to the crime leads us to the other conclusion. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The law requires that a jury be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt. An uncorroborated confession or evidence of perjury, given by one witness only,9 does not as a matter of law establish be- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n yond a reasonable doubt the commission of a crime but these are exceptions to the normal requirement that disputed questions of fact are to be submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions. In this case the earlier statements of birth and therefore necessarily of residence outside of the United States, if believed by the jury, prove the falsity of the statements to the contrary in the application. Where the crime charged is a false statement and where it finds its only proof in admissions to the contrary prior to the act set out in the indictment, it may be unlikely that a jury will conclude that the falsity of the later statement is proven beyond a reasonable doubt but such evidence justifies submission of the question to them.\n In this present case there was other evidence of the falsity of the disputed statements in the application. The manifest of the S. S. Haverford showed petitioner's arrival and classification as an alien at Philadelphia in 1914. The forged birth certificate adds to the proof of foreign birth by showing an effort to establish American nativity by false means and the Government's proof of the absence of any attempt at naturalization supports the allegation of false statement as to citizenship.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 100. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Wharton, Criminal Law, 12th Ed.,  357, 359; Daeche v.

Gibbs, of Jacksonville, Fla ., for Watson and others.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 394]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In broad outline, these cases involve the constitutionality of Florida statutes regulating the business of persons hol ing music copyrights and declaring price-fixing combinations of 'authors, composers, publishers, (and) owners' of such copyrights to be illegal and in restraint of trade.\n The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), one of the appellants in No. 611 and one of the appellees in No. 610, is a combination which controls the performance rights of a major part of the available supply of copyrighted popular music. The other appellants in No. 611 (appellees in No. 610) are individual composers, authors and publishers of music controlled by ASCAP. The appellees in No. 611 ( appellants in No. 610) are the Attorney General and all the state prosecuting attorneys of Florida who are charged with the duty of enforcing certain parts of the statutes in question.\n These who cases were originally a single action, in which ASCAP and its co-parties sought to enjoin the state officials from enforcing a 1937 Florida statute. \n1\n A \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 395]\n\u00a0\n federal district court, composed of three judges under  266 of Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, granted a temporary injunction, and this Court affirmed without passing upon the merits of the constitutional questions involved. Gibbs v. Buck, \n307 \nU.S. 66\n, 59 S.Ct. 725. A supplemental bill of complaint was then filed, asking that the three judge court enjoin a 1939 Florida statute relating to the same subject. \n2\n On final hearing, the three judge court again enjoined the state officials from enforcing any part of the 1937 statute, but granted the injunction only as to certain sections of the 1939 act. Buck v. Gibbs, D.C., 34 F. Supp. 510. No. 611 is an appeal by ASCAP and its co-complainants from the refusal to enjoin the state officials from enforcing the remainder of the 1939 act. No. 610 is an appeal by the state officials from the order granting the injunction as to the 1937 act and as to certain sections of the 1939 act.\n The court below, without passing at all upon the validity of thirteen out of the twenty-one sections and subsections of the 1937 act, held that the remaining eight sections deprived copyright owners of rights granted them by the federal copyright laws, and that the statute must fall in its entirety. This it did upon the premise that the sections held invalid and the other parts of the bill were intended by the Florida legislature to form 'a harmonious whole' and to 'stand or fall together.' (34 F.Supp. 517 .) The ultimate questions involved are such that we must first determine whether this ruling was correct. We hold that it was not, for the following reasons.\n The Florida legislature expressed a purpose directly contrary to the District Court's finding. For what the legislature intended in this regard was spelled out in section 12 of the Act in the clear and emphatic language of the legislature itself. That section reads:\n'If any section, sub-section, sentence, clause or any part of this Act, is for any reason, held or declared to be \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 396]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional, imperative (sic) or void, such holding or invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions of this Act; and it shall be construed to have been the legislative intent to pass this Act without such unconstitutional, inoperative or invalid part therein; and, the remainder of this Act, after the exclusion of such part or parts, shall be held and deemed to be valid as if such excluded parts had not been included herein.'\n\n This is a flat statement that the Florida legislature intended that the act should stand and be enforced 'after the exclusion of such part or parts' as might be held invalid. Unless a controlling decision by Florida's courts compels a different course, the federal courts are not justified in speculating that the state legislature meant exactly the opposite of what it declared 'to have been the legislative intent.' But the Supreme Court of Florida recognizes and seeks to carry out the legislative intent thus expressed. Speaking of a similar severabi ity clause of another statute, that court said: 'The act as a whole evinces a purpose on the part of the Legislature to impose a license tax on chain stores, and section 15 provides that if any section, provision, or clause thereof, or if the act as applied to any circumstances shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity shall not affect other portions of the act held valid nor shall it extend to other circumstances not held to be invalid. Under the liberal terms of section 15 it may be reasonably discerned that the Legislature intended that the act under review should be held good under any eventuality that did not produce an unreasonable, unconstitutional, or an absurd result. ... The test to determine work-ability after severance, and whether the remainder of the act should be upheld, rests on the fact of whether or not the invalid portion is of such import that the valid part would be incomplete or would cause results not contemplated by the Legisla- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 397]\n\u00a0\n ture.' Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee, 109 Fla. 477, 481, 147 So. 463, 149 So. 8, 9. Measured by this test the court below was in error, for there can be no doubt that section 1 and the other sections upon which the court failed to pass are complete in themselves; they are not only consistent with the statute's purpose but are in reality the very heart of the act, comprising a distinct legislative plan for the suppression of combinations declared to be unlawful. For as pointed out by the court below, the sections that were not passed on are those which outlaw combinations to fix fees and prescribe the means whereby the legislative proscription against them can be made effective. \n3\n Since, therefore, that phase of the act which aimed at unlawful combinations is complete in itself and capable of standing alone, we must consider it as a separable phase of the statute in determining whether the injunction was properly issued against the state officials.\n As a matter of fact, as the record stands the right of ASCAP and its co-complaintants to an injunction depends upon this phase of the statute and is not to be determined at all by the validity or invalidity of the particular sections which the court below thought inconsistent with the federal Constitution and the copyright laws passed pursuant to it. The ultimate determinative question, therefore, is whether Florida has the power it \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 398]\n\u00a0\n exercised to outlaw activities within the state of price fixing combinations composed of copyright owners. But before considering that question it is necessary that we explain why we do not discuss, and why an injunction could not rest upon, any other phase of Florida's statutory plan.\n Defendants in the injunction proceedings are the state's Attorney General, who is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the state's criminal laws, and all of the state's prosecuting attorneys, who are subject to the Attorney General's authority in the performance of their official duties. \n4\n Under the statutes before us, it is made the duty of the state's prosecuting attorneys, acting under the Attorney General's direction, to institute in the state courts criminal or civil proceedings. The original bill alleged that the defendants had threatened to-and would, unless restrained-enforce the 1937 statute 'in each and all of its terms and the hole thereof, and particularly against these complainants and others similarly situated ...', and that as a consequence complainants would suffer irreparable injury and damages. The supplemental bill contained similar allegations as to the 1939 act. Both bills were drawn upon the premise that complainants were entitled to an injunction restraining all the state's prosecuting officers from enforc- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 399]\n\u00a0\n ing any single part of either of the lengthy statutes, under any circumstances that could arise and in respect to each and every one of the multitudinous regulations and prohibitions contained in those laws. In their answers, the state's representatives specifically denied that they had made any threats whatever to enforce the acts against complainants or any one else. In their answer to the supplemental bill, however, they said that they would perform all duties imposed upon them by the 1939 act. The findings of the court on this subject were general, and were to the effect that 'Defendants have threatened to and will enforce such State Statutes against these Complainants and others similarly situated in the event that such Complainants and others similarly situated refuse to comply with said State Statutes or do any of the acts made unlawful by said State Statutes.' It is to be noted that the court did not find any threat to enforce any specific provision of either law. And there is a complete lack of record evidence or information of any other sort to show any threat to prosecute the complainants or any one else in connection with any specific clause or paragraph of the numerous prohibitions of the acts, subject to a possible exception to be discussed later. The most that can possibly be gathered from the meager record references to this vital allegation of complainants' bill is that though no suits had been threatened, and no criminal or civil proceedings instituted, and no particular proceedings contemplated, the state officials stood ready to perform their duties under their oath of office should they acquire knowledge of violations. And as to the 1937 act, the state's Attorney General took the position from the very beginning, both below and in this Court, that under his construction of the earlier act no duties of any kind were imposed upon him and his subordinates except with relationship to prohibited combinations of the type defined in section 1. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 400]\n\u00a0\n Federal injunctions against state criminal statutes, either in their entirety or with respect to their separate and distinct prohibitions, are not to be granted as a matter of course, even if such statutes are unconstitutional. 'No citizen or member of the community is immune from prosecution, in good faith, for his alleged criminal acts. The imminence of such a prosecution even though alleged to be unauthorized and hence unlawful is not alone ground for relief in equity which exerts its extraordinary powers only to prevent irreparable injury to the plaintiff who seeks its aid.' Beal v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Corp., \n312 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 61 S.Ct. 418, 420, 85 L.Ed. --. A general statement that an officer stands ready to perform his duty falls far short of such a threat as would warrant the intervention of equity. And this is especially true where there is a complete absence of any showin of a definite and expressed intent to enforce particular clauses of a broad, comprehensive and multi- provisioned statute. For such a general statement is not the equivalent of a threat that prosecutions are to be gegun so immediately, in such numbers, and in such manner as to indicate the virtual certainty of that extraordinary injury which alone justifies equitable suspension of proceedings in criminal courts. The imminence and immediacy of proposed enforcement, the nature of the threats actually made, and the exceptional and irreparable injury which complainants would sustain if those threats were carried out are among the vital allegations which must be shown to exist before restraint of criminal proceedings is justified. Yet from the lack of consideration accorded to this aspect of the complaint, both by complainants in presenting their case and by the court below in reaching a decision, it is clearly apparent that there was a failure to give proper weight to what is in our eyes an essential prerequisite to the exercise of this equitable power. The clear import of this record is that the court below thought that if a federal court finds a many-sided state criminal \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 401]\n\u00a0\n statute unconstitutional, a mere statement by a prosecuting officer that he intends to perform his duty is sufficient justification to warrant the federal court in enjoining all state prosecuting officers from in any way enforcing the statute in question. Such, however, is not the rule. 'The general rule is that equity will not interfere to prevent the enforcement of a criminal statute even though unconstitutional. ... To justify such interference there must be exceptional circumstances and a clear showing that an injunction is necessary in order to afford adequate protection of constitutional rights. ... We have said that it must appear that 'the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate'; otherwise, the accused should first set up his defense in the state court, even though the validity of a statute is challenged. There is ample opportunity for ultimate review by this Court of federal questions.' Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 96 S., 55 S.Ct. 678, 680, 681\n\n\n Such 'exceptional circumstances' and 'great and immediate' danger of irreparable loss were not here shown. Tested by this rule, therefore, and with the possible exception of that phase of the statute outlawing Florida activities by combinations declared unlawful in section 1 of the 1937 act ( which we shall later consider separately), neither the findings of the court below nor the record on which they were based justified an injunction against the state prosecuting officers.\n In addition to the fact that the situation here does not meet the tests laid down in the decided cases, the very scope of these two statutes illustrates the wisdom of a policy of judicial self restraint on the part of federal courts in suspending state statutes in their entirety upon the ground that a complainant might eventually be prosecuted for violating some part of them. The Florida Supreme Court, which under our dual system of government has the last word on the construction and meaning of statutes of that state, has never yet passed upon \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 402]\n\u00a0\n the statutes now before us. It is highly desirable that it should have an opportunity to do so.5 There are forty-two separate sections in the two acts. While some sections are repetitious, and while other sections are unimportant for present purposes, there are embraced within these two acts many separate and distinct regulations, commands and prohibitions. No one can foresee the varying applications of these separate provisions which conceivably might be made. A law which is constitutional as applied in one manner may still contravene the Constitution as applied in another. Since all contingencies of attempted enforcement cannot be envisioned in advance of those applications, courts have in the main found it wiser to delay passing upon the constitutionality of all the separate phases of a comprehensive statute until faced with cases involving particular provisions as specifically applied to persons who claim to be injured. Passing upon the possible significance of the manifold provisions of a broad statute in advance of efforts to apply the separate provisions is analogous to rendering an advisory opinion upon a statute or a declaratory judgment upon a hypothetical case. It is of course conceivable that a statute might be flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort might be made to apply it. It is sufficient to say that the statutes before us are not of this type. Cases under the separate sections and paragraphs of the acts can be tried as they arise-preferably in the state courts. Any federal questions that are properly presented can then be brought here. But \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 403]\n\u00a0\n at this time the record does not justify our passing upon any part of the statute except, possibly, that phase which prohibits activities in Florida by combinations declared unlawful. While the proof and findings in this regard are not as clear and specific as they might and should be, we nevertheless, under the circumstances of his case, proceed to this ultimate and decisive question.\n In the consideration of this case, much confusion has been brought about by discussing the statutes as though the power of a state to prohibit or regulate combinations in restraint of trade was identical with and went no further than the power exercised by Congress in the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note. Such an argument rests upon a mistaken premise. \n6\n Nor is it within our province in determining whether or not this phase of the state statute comes into collision with the federal Constitution or laws passed pursuant thereto to scrutinize the act in order to determine whether we believe it to be fair or unfair, conducive to good or evil for the people of Florida, or capable of protecting or defeating the public interest of the state. \n7\n These questions were for the legislature of Florida and it has decided them. And, unless constitutionally valid federal legislation has granted to individual copyright owners the right to combine, the state's power validly to prohibit the proscribed combinations cannot be held non-existent merely because such individuals can pre- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 404]\n\u00a0\n serve their property rights better in combination than they can as individuals. We find nothing in the copyright laws which purports to grant to copyright owners the privilege of combining in violation of otherwise valid state or federal laws. We have, in fact, determined to the contrary with relation to other copyright privileges. \n8\n But complainants urge that there is a distinction between our previous holdings and the question here. This contention is based on the idea that Congress has granted the copyright privilege with relation to public performances of music, and that with reference to the protection of this particular privilege, combination is essential. We are therefore asked to conclude from the asserted necessities of their situation that Congress intended to grant this extraordinary privilege of combination. This we cannot do. We are pointed to nothing either in the language of the copyright laws or in the history of their enactment to indicate any congressional purpose to deprive the states, either in whole or in part of their long-recognized power to regulate combinations in restraint of trade. Compare Waters- Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1), \n212 \nU.S. 86, 107\n, 29 S.Ct. 220, 225.\n Under the findings of fact of the court below, ASCAP comes squarely within the definition of the combinations prohibited by section 1 of the 1937 act. Section 1 defines as an unlawful combination an aggregation of authors, composers, publishers, and owners of copyrighted vocal or instrumental musical compositions who form any society, association, or the like and the members of which constitute a substantial number of the persons, firms or corporations within the United States who own or control such musical compositions and 'when one of the objects of such combination is the determination and fix- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 387, 405]\n\u00a0\n ation of license fees or other exactions required by such combination for itself or its members or other interested parties.' Section 8 of the 1937 act makes it an offense for such combinations 'to act within this State in violation of the terms of this Act.' The court below found that there were 1,425 composers and authors who were members of ASCAP; that the principal music publishers of the country are members; that the Society controls the right of performance of 45,000 members of similar societies in foreign countries; and that the Board of Directors of ASCAP have 'absolute control over the fixing of prices to be charged for performance licenses ....' Since under the record and findings here ASCAP is an association within the meaning of section 1 of the 1937 act, we are not called upon an its instance to pass upon the validity of other provisions contained in the numerous clauses, sentences, and phases of the 1937 or 1939 act which might cover other combinations not now before us. It is enough for us to say in this case that the phase of Florida's law prohibiting activities of those unlawful combinations described in section 1 of the 1937 act does not contravene the copyright laws of the federal Constitution; that particular attacks upon other specified provisions of the statutes involved are not appropriate for determination in this proceeding; that the court below erred in granting the injunction; and that the bill should have been dismissed. All other questions remain open for consideration and disposition in appropriate proceedings. For the reasons given, the judgment below in No. 610 is reversed and the cause is remanded to the lower court with instructions to dismiss the bill. The judgment in No. 611 is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded in part and affirmed in part.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Fla.Laws 1937, ch. 17807. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Fla.Laws 1939, ch. 19653. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court said:\n'There remain: Sections 1, 2-C and 3, in effect declaring ASCAP and similar societies illegal associations, outlawing its arrangements for license fees, and proscribing and making an offense, attempts to collect them; Section 7-B making persons, acting for such a combination, agents for it and liable to the penalties of the Act; Section 8 fixing the penalties; Section 9 giving the state courts jurisdiction to enforce the Act, civilly and criminally; and Sections 10-A, 10-B, 11-A and 11-B, prescribing procedure under it.' 34 F.Supp. 516.

LOVETT(1941)\nNo. 709\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1941\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of Arkansas.\n Mr. J. G. Burke, of Helena, Ark., for appellants. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 363]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter G. Riddick, of Little Rock, Ark., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal presents the question whether an Arkansas Act of March 17, 1937, as construed and applied, violates Article I,  10, of the Constitution.\n March 20, 1935, an act of the legislature of Arkansas1 took effect which provided: 'Whenever the State and County Taxes have not been paid upon any real or personal property within the time provided by law, and publication of the notice of the sale has been given under a valid and proper description, as provided by law, the sale of any real or personal property for the non-payment of said taxes shall not hereafter be set aside by any proceedings at law or in equity because of any irregularity, informality or omission by any officer in the assessment of said property, the levying of said taxes, the making of the assessor's or tax book, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 365]\n\u00a0\n the making or filing of the delinquent list, the recording thereof, or the recording of the list and notice of sale, or the certificate as to the publication of said notice of sale; provided, that this Act shall not apply to any suit now pending seeking to set aside any such sale, or to any suit brought within six months from the effective date of this Act for the purpose of setting aside any such sale.'\n Certain land in Desha County, Arkansas, was sold to the State in 1933 for nonpayment of 1932 taxes. The land was not redeemed and was certified to the State, as owner. In 1936 the Commissioner of State Lands, on behalf of the State, by deeds reciting his statutory authority so to do, con eyed to the appellants all the right, title, and interest of the State in two parcels of the land.\n By an Act of March 17, 1937, the Act of March 20, 1935, was repealed. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n January 10, 1939, the corporation which owned the land when sold for non-payment of taxes conveyed to the appellee and, on January 21, he brought suit against the appellants to cancel the State's deeds, to quiet his title, and for mesne profits or rents. He alleged that there were irregularities in the proceedings prior to the sale to the State which rendered it void. The appellants admitted the irregularities. It was agreed on all hands that though these irregularities would have constituted grounds for avoiding the sale but for the provisions of the Act of 1935, they would not have been available to the appellee if the Act were still in force. The trial court entered a decree in favor of the appellee which the Supreme Court affirmed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The appellants contended in the courts below, and con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 366]\n\u00a0\n tend here, that if the Act of 1937 be given the effect of divesting them of title confirmed in them by the Act of 1935 the later Act impairs the obligation of their contracts with the State. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that 'the Act (of 1935) does not profess to cure tax sales, but only (provides) that tax sales shall not be set aside by the courts because of certain irregularities and informalities, naming them.' It said that the appellants acquired no greater vested interest or title than the State had and the repeal of the Act of 1935 'violated no constitutional right of theirs to a defense' thereunder. We are of opinion that the decision was erroneous.\n For present purposes it is unnecessary to recite the statutory procedure for assessment, levy, and collection of real estate taxes in Arkansas. If the taxes levied become delinquent a sale by the Collector is authorized. If no person bids the amount of the delinquent taxes, penalty, and costs, the Collector is to bid in the property in the name of the State. \n4\n The State is not required to pay the amount bid in its name. \n5\n The Clerk of the County Court is required to make a record of the sale to the State and send a certificate thereof to the Auditor of State. \n6\n Lands thus sold to the State may be redeemed within two years of the sale. \n7\n After expiration of the period of redemption, the County Clerk executes a certificate of sale and causes the same to be recorded in the County Recorder's office. Thereupon the lands vest in the State. The certificate, after recordation, is sent by the Clerk to the Commissioner of State Lands and thereupon the lands are subject to disposal according to law. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 367]\n\u00a0\n The Commissioner is authorized to sell them and to make deeds to purchasers. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n As the Supreme Court has indicated in this case, Act 142 of 1935 was one of a series of statutes adopted to prevent the setting aside of tax sales and titles based upon them for informalities and irregularities in the assessment and levy of taxes and the sale of property for delinquent taxes which had seriously impeded the effective collection of taxes and diminished the State's revenue.\n In Berry v. Davidson, 199 Ark. 276, 280, 133 S.W.2d 442, 444, the court, after referring to several similar acts, said:\n'... we now think it apparent that the legislature was endeavoring to find and put into effect a remedy or means to correct the evils growing out of nonpayment of taxes, to prevent tax evasion. For many years it was a recognized proposition that tax forfeitures and sales of land on account thereof were well nigh universally held ineffectual to convey title, and there is perhaps at this time, no doubt, that the idea had grown and there was a general r cognition of the futility of taxing laws that it was thought by many that people need not pay taxes if they were willing to meet the worry and expenses of litigation in regard thereto.\n\n'Act 142, above mentioned, while it was still in force was another evidence of the legislature's effort and struggle to correct or cure these well grounded and long established practices illustrating the futility of the law requiring payment of taxes. Out of all this has come Act 119 of the Acts of 1935 construed and upheld in the last cited case. (Fuller v. Wilkinson et al., 198 Ark. 102, 128 S.W.2d 251.) According to the terms of that statute when it shall have been invoked in regard to such tax sales, we must, and do, hold that the decree of confirmation of a sale to the state operates 'as a complete bar against any and all persons, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 368]\n\u00a0\n firms, corporations, quasicorporations, associations ... who may ... claim said property', section 9, sold for taxes subject only to the exceptions set forth and stated in the act none of which is applicable to aid the appellant.'\n\n It is evident from these statements that the purpose of Act 142 was definitely to assure purchasers from the State that the land bought by them could not be taken away from them on grounds theretofore available to the delinquent taxpayer.\n In its opinion in the present case, the court lays stress on the fact that Act 142 was not a curative act although, in earlier decisions, it had repeatedly so designated it. \n10\n But we do not deem the name or label of the legislation important. The fact is, as the court below holds, that the purpose and effect of the statute was to render unavailing to the owner whose property had been sold for taxes, as grounds of attack on the title of the purchaser from the State, irregularities and informalities in the performance of acts by State officers in connection with the assessment, levy, and sale which the legislature could, in its discretion have omitted to prescribe as essentials to the passing of a valid title.\n The Act of 1935 must be viewed in the setting of the statutory scheme of taxation, sale of forfeited lands to the State, and sale in turn by the State. Its purpose was to assure one willing to purchase from the State a title immune from attack on grounds theretofore available. By its legislation the State said, in effect, to the pro- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 369]\n\u00a0\n spective purchaser of lands, acquired for delinquent taxes, that if he would purchase he should have the immunity. Under the settled rule of decision in this court the execution of the State's deeds to the appellants constituted the execution or consummation of a contract, the rights arising from which are protected from impairment by Article I,  10 of the Constitution; and the obligation of the State arising out of such a grant is as much protected by Article I,  10, as that of an agreement by an individual. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87. 136, 137, 139. The Act of 1935, taken in connection with the other statutes regulating the acquirement by the State, and the disposition by it, of lands sold for delinquent taxes, constituted in effect an offer by the State to those who might become purchasers of such lands, and the protection it afforded to the title acquired by such purchasers necessarily inured to every purchaser acting under it and constituted a contract with him. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The federal and state courts have held, with practical unanimity, that any substanti l alteration by subsequent legislation of the rights of a purchaser at tax sale, accruing to him under laws in force at the time of his purchase, is void as impairing the obligation of contract. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 370]\n\u00a0\n Appellee relies upon the circumstance that the State's deed is a quit- claim. From this it is inferred that no contract was made that the terms of the Act of 1935 were to bind the State with respect to the title conveyed. But 'the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.' 13 This court has held that the terms of a statute according rights and immunities to a vendee of the state are a part of the obligation of the deed made pursuant to it. The grant of the State of Georgia involved in Fletcher v. Peck, supra, was a patent of the public lands of the State and, of course, contained no warranty of title save such as is implied from the fact that the State purports to grant its own lands. In Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 \nU.S. 1\n, 11 S.Ct. 699, the rights of the plaintiff held to be protected by Art. 1, Sec. 10, arose out of his application for a patent filed pursuant to a state statute. The impairment was worked by a subsequent statute seeking to destroy the right of the plaintiff to the patent pursuant to his compliance with the earlier act. No warranty was involved. In Appleby v. New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364\n, 46 S.Ct. 569, it appeared that the legislature had fixed the shore line of the City of New York along the Hudson River and that the land inside that line had been granted to the city with the consequent right to convey it. The city had conveyed land under water, on the landward side of the line, to Appleby by a quit-claim deed. \n14\n By subsequent \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 371]\n\u00a0\n statutes the State granted the city authority to use the land in question for municipal purposes and the city proceeded to improve it. This court held that the city's grant, made with full legislative sanction, could not be impaired by the subsequent legislation.\n As in the cases cited, so here, the question is whether the State granted a valuable right which it subsequently essayed to take away. The Supreme Court of Arkansas sustained the constitutional validity of Act 142 of 1935 on the obvious ground that a taxpayer has no vested right in any given form of procedure for forfeiture of lands for nonpayment of taxes. As that court has held, the extent of his right is that he shall have notice of the sale and a fair opportunity to prevent forfeiture for default. It is suggested that the acts of the State in depriving the taxpayer of the right to set aside a sale for technical procedural defects is of like quality with the State's attempt to restore the taxpayer's rights against the appellants who purchased from the state. But obviously the two acts are not of the same quality. The taxpayer had neither a contract nor any other constitutional right as against the State to insist upon any given form of procedure so long as what was done in forfeiting his lands was not arbitrary or unfair. But the appellants, as purchasers from the State, were given, by the Act of 1935, an important assurance that the State would not itself take away or authorize others to destroy the estate which it had granted, by reason of technical defects in procedure cured by the Act of 1935\n\n\n The appellee suggests that it is significant that the State was not a party to this suit, and was not, therefore, seeking to take back what it had granted. But, as Fletcher v. Peck, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 372]\n\u00a0\n supra, shows, this is not important for that suit was between two private parties, as is this, one claiming rights conferred by the earlier state action and the other claiming superseding rights under later legislation.\n It begs the question to say that the State may not abdicate its police power. In the exercise of the policy committed to the legislature it is competent for the state to enter into a contract which it intends as an assurance of protection to its grantee. \n15\n This we think the State has plainly done in the present instance. The judgment is reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n There is far more involved here than a mere litigation between rival claimants to a few hundred acres of Arkansas land. In my view, the statute here stricken down is but one of many acts adopted both by Congress and by state legislatures in an effort to meet the baffling economic and sociological problems growing out of a nation-wide depression. These problems-among them the owners' loss of homes and farms, chiefly through mortgage sales and tax forfeitures and the states' concomitant loss of tax revenues-challenged the wisdom and capacity of the nation's legislators.\n Among the efforts of Arkansas' legislators to meet these problems was the legislation adopted by Act 142 of 1935 and repealed by Act 264 of 1937- the repealing act being the statute here held invalid. It is quite apparent that considerations of public policy induced the Arkansas legislature to pass the 1935 act whereby Arkansas courts were prohibited from setting aside certain types of defective tax sales 'by any proceedings at law or in equity.' At the time that act was passed, more than \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 373]\n\u00a0\n 25% of the real property in the state was tax delinquent. \n1\n Loss of revenue from so substantial a portion of the state's total acreage was a serious matter. In the eyes of some people, the land could be sold and the lost revenues recouped if some of the formal grounds on which tax titles could be invalidated were rendered unavailing. \n2\n It seems clear that the 1935 legislature was persuaded of the wisdom of such a step. But it also seems clear that the 1935 act was repealed in 1937 because the legislature became convinced that the law had worked directly contrary to the state's policy of obtaining the benefits believed to flow from continuity of possession b home owners and farmers,3 that it had accomplished inequitable results, that it had thereby 'operated injuriously to the interests of the State, and that sound policy dictated its repeal.' \n4\n This is apparent from reading that part of section 2 of the repealing act of 1937 which declared that 'said Act 142, Acts 1935, ignores jurisdictional prerequisites to effect valid sales of tax delinquent lands, as prescribed by law, and has brought the laws of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 374]\n\u00a0\n the State incident thereto into doubt and confusion ....'\n Both the 1935 act and the 1937 act repealing it touch on Arkansas' policy as to taxation, tax forfeiture, and land ownership-matters of public policy which are of vital interest to the state and all its citizens. It was a matter of serious moment to Arkansas that 25% of the state's privately owned land-homes, farms, and other property-was in jeopardy of being taken from its owners because of inability to pay taxes. If only 50% of the forfeitures were homes and farms, simultaneous ouster of so many citizens could result in forced migrations and discontents disastrous in their consequences. The manifestations of financial distress revealed by the widespread delinquency spotlighted conditions which called for the best in legislative statesmanship. To seek a rational and fair solution to the problem was not only within the power of Arkansas' lawmakers, but was also their imperative duty. Without attempting to judge the wisdom or equities of either act, it is easy to see that both the 1935 and the 1937 act represented rational and understandable attempts to achieve such a solution. To hold that the contract clause of the Federal Constitution is a barrier to the 1937 attempt to restore to the distressed landowners the remedy partly taken away by the 1935 act is, in my view, wholly inconsistent with the spirit and the language of that Constitution.\n As already stated, Arkansas was not faced with a problem peculiar to that state alone. At the depth of the depression, over 20% of all real property in the United States was tax delinquent. \n5\n Nor was Arkansas alone in seeking to do something about the situation. 'Since 1928 \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 375]\n\u00a0\n nearly every state in the Union has enacted legislation dealing with the problem of delinquent taxes and a number of states have completely remodeled their systems of tax delinquency laws. This legislative activity has been called forth by the unprecedented increase just before and during the depression in the amount of unpaid property taxes and by the consequent threat both to the financial stability of state and local governments and to the security of private property.' \n6\n By acts passed in the single year of 1933, twelve states extended the time for paying taxes already due, eleven states postponed sales for taxes, twenty-six states ( among them Arkansas) waived or reduced penalties and interest on taxes already delinquent or for which property had already been sold, nine states (among them Arkansas) lengthened the period of redemption on property already sold, and sixteen states permitted payment of already delinquent taxes in installments spread over a period of years. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The states, and the federal government also, were faced with a 'financial crisis (which had) the same results as if it were caused by flood, earthquake, or disturbance in nature.' \n8\n The federal government greatly expanded facilities for farm loans; set up the Home Owners Loan Corporation; practically underwrote the nation's banking system; passed the Frazier-Lemke Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  203; widened the scope of bankruptcy jurisdiction; and embarked on a system of nationwide relief. In the states, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 376]\n\u00a0\n part of the effort to meet the crisis took the form of mortgage and tax moratoria; part took other forms, including that of the legislation now before us. All may well be considered parts of the larger and over-all effort to avert catyclysmic changes which were thought to threaten the equilibrium and tranquility of our society. This Court, in its notable decision in Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481, upheld that phase of the Minnesota effort which took the form of a mortgage moratorium. In the course of the opinion, the Court quoted the state Attorney General, who in his argument here had stated: \"Tax delinquencies were alarmingly great, rising as high as 78% in one county of the state. In seven counties of the state the tax delinquency was over 50%. Because of these delinquencies many towns, school districts, villages and cities were practically bankrupt' ... (and) serious breaches of the peace had occurred.' 9 The policy behind mortgage moratoria and the policy behind tax leniency to landowners are inextricably intertwined. \n10\n The basic philosophy of the two types of legislation is identical. For encouragement of home and farm ownership has always been treated as a major objective of our social and governmental policy. And therefore what was said in the Blaisdell case with reference to the contract clause is equally applicable here: 'Not only is the constitutional provision qualified by the measure of control which the state retains over remedial processes, but the state also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end 'has the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect.' Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, (188), 189 (87 A.L.R. 721). Not only are existing laws \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 377]\n\u00a0\n read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n So much for the general setting which gave rise to the law here held invalid. In order better to understand the effect that law had on the appellants and the appellee, it is necessary to consider other provisions of Arkansas law.\n At the time appellants secured from the state a quit claim deed to the lands here in question, the law provided two alternative means of assuring purchasers of tax forfeited lands against loss:\n\n\n (1)\n Such purchasers, under certain circumstances, could hold on to the land through the protection afforded by the remedial processes of the courts;12\n\n\n (2)\n In case they could not hold on to the land, such purchasers were afforded the protection of a judicially enforceable right to be reimbursed by the landowner for the amount paid out for purchase price and subsequent taxes, with interest, as well as for improvements-all in the event that the former owners of the land should for any reason be able to prove that the lands had never been validly forfeited. Ark.Dig.Stats. (Pope, 1937)  4663-4665, 13881. \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 378]\n\u00a0\n The Arkansas legislature, by Act 264 of 1937, narrowed the circumstances under which purchasers might hold on to the land. But the second alternative assurance remained intact.\n From my study of the case I am of opinion that:\n\n\n (1)\n The 1937 Arkansas statute here attacked neither impaired nor sought to repudiate any contractual agreement or obligation expressly or impliedly assumed by the state;\n\n\n (2)\n The 1937 Arkansas statute was enacted well within the state's general legislative powers and is in no way inconsistent with the true intent and fair interpretation of the federal constitutional prohibition which commands that 'No State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts ....' Article 1,  10.\n First. The state, by quit claim deeds, without any express warranty whatever, conveyed the lands in question to appellants. It is appellants' claim that an 'obligation of the contract created by the grant of the State' has been impaired by the Arkansas statute. Stripped of surplus verbiage, appellants' naked contention is that Arkansas, by its quit claim sale and conveyance, obligated itself to refrain from thereafter passing a general legislative enactment if such enactment would affect in any manner any of the legal means provided to protect tax sale purchasers against loss. We need not here consider whether under the Arkansas Constitution the legislature could have thus bargained away the state's legislative power in setting up a scheme for the sale of tax forfeited land. For there was no attempt on the part of the state officials who made the sale to exercise any such extraordinary authority.\n A deed to property without warranty is an agreement to transfer whatever title the grantor has. And even without express language to that effect in the conveyance, it is reasonable to say that a valid quit claim con- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 379]\n\u00a0\n veyance carries along with it an implied obligation that the grantor will not repudiate the grant and attempt to reassert title in himself, for such a reassertion of title would be contrary to the express purpose which actuated the parties in reaching the agreement which ended in the conveyance. The implied obligation not to reassert title was th basis of the decision in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, a decision which this Court relies on in the case at bar. Cf. Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 414, 415. In Fletcher v. Peck, the court said: 'A contract executed, as well as one which is executory, contains obligations binding on the parties. A grant, in its own nature, amounts to an extinguishment of the right of the grantor, and implies a contract not to reassert that right. A party is, therefore, always estopped by his own grant.' \n13\n What the State of Georgia did in that case was to seek to reassert title to land which the court found it had conveyed for a consideration under what the court deemed to be a valid contract. True, Georgia was not a party to the actual litigation, but by purporting to convey to one purchaser land which had already been conveyed by it to another purchaser the state clearly attempted to assert that it still had title to the land. Here the State of Arkansas has not repudiated any implied obligation by attempting to reassert title in the lands whose ownership is now in issue. There is no litigation here between the state and its grantees, and none, as in Fletcher v. Peck, between rival grantees of the state. Appellee claims title through an owner whose estate Arkansas had purportedly forfeited for unpaid taxes. Neither in the facts of this case nor in the legislation attacked is there any kind of challenge to the validity of \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 380]\n\u00a0\n the state's conveyance of all the title the state possessed. As pointed out above, Fletcher v. Peck rested upon the assumption that there was a continuing obligation on the part of the state, as on the part of any other grantor, not to repudiate a valid conveyance and attempt to reassert a claim to property which had been sold. Such a ruling offers no support to the contention that Arkansas, in quit claiming all its interest to appellants, thereby assumed a continuing contractual obligation that its legislative department would in no way alter the procedural rules to be followed by the Arkansas courts in adjudicating controversies between the state's grantees and the original owners whom the state had attempted to divest of their property by the drastic method of forfeiture. 'The trouble at the bottom of the ... case is that the supposed promise ... on which it is founded does not exist. If such a promise had been intended, it was far too important to be left to implication.' Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 436\n, 23 S.Ct. 531, 532. 'The patent ( here, the quit claim deed) contains no covenant to do, or not to do, any further act in relation to the land; and we do not, in this case, feel at liberty to create one by implication.' Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 280, 289. 'A contract binding the state is only created by clear language, and is not to be extended by implication beyond the terms of the statute. ... In the case at bar ... the act ... operated in no manner as a restraint upon the legislature or as a contract upon its part that the state would not act whenever in its judgment it perceived the necessity for an additional ferry. ... No promise made by the legislature by the first act is broken by the second.' Williams v. Wingo, \n177 \nU.S. 601, 603\n, 604 S., 20 S.Ct. 793, 794. 'There is no undertaking on the part of the state with the purchaser that the remedy prescribed in this statute, and no other, shall be pursued, unless it is to be implied from the mere presence of the provision in the statute, \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 381]\n\u00a0\n and we think it well settled that no such implication arises.' Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 \nU.S. 399, 410\n, 22 S.Ct. 384, 388.\n In this case Arkansas has fully complied with the express terms of its contract. For there was certainly no express obligation on the part of Arkansas that its general laws concerning forfeiture of property and sale of land should remain static. Nor do I believe that any such obligation can properly be implied. Arkansas did not agree with the appellants that it would keep on its statute books legislation which in effect forfeited its citizens' lands in a way and manner which was directly in the teeth of what had been the Arkansas law at the time the alleged forfeitures occurred. And I do not believe that we should compel the accomplishment of such a result by what I conceive to be a stretching of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.\n Second. Measured either by the constitutional provision itself or by that provision as construed by prior decisions of this Court, I am of opinion that the Arkansas statute is consistent with what was referred to in Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 438\n, 439 S., 54 S.Ct. 231, 240, 88 A.L.R. 1481, as the true intent and fair interpretation of the contract clause.\n Writing in 1817, Judge Livingston, of the Federal Circuit Court of New York, had this to say of the contract clause: 'There is not, perhaps, in the constitution any article of more ambiguous import, or which has occasioned, and will continue to occasion, more discussion and disagreement, ... or the application of which to the cases which occur, will be attended with more perplexity and embarrassment ... and it will not be surprising if, in the discharge of it, great diversity of opinion should arise.' Adams v. Storey, Fed.Cas. No.66, 1 Paine 79, 88, 89. In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, written in 1933, appears a re sume of previous decisions which \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 382]\n\u00a0\n substantiate the accuracy of Judge Livingston's prophecy. And in the Blaisdell case this Court quoted a statement originally made by Justice Johnson in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286: 'But to assign to contracts, universally, a literal purport, and to exact for them a rigid literal fulfilment, could not have been the intent of the constitution. It is repelled by a hundred examples. Societies exercise a positive control as well over the inception, construction and fulfilment of contracts, as over the form and measure of the remedy to enforce them.' The accuracy of this statement cannot be questioned by one who reflects upon the extent to which contracts and agreements are a part of the daily activities of our society. For so nearly universal are contractual relationships that it is difficult if not impossible to conceive of laws which do not have either direct or indirect bearing upon contractual obligations. Therefore, it would go far towards paralyzing the legislative arm of state governments to say that no legislative body could ever pass a law which would impair in any manner any contractual obligation of any kind. Upon a recognition of this basic truth rests the decision in the Blaisdell case. Such recognition was made clear by the use of the following expressions, either quoted and implicitly approved, or used for the first time: 'the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula'; 'No attempt has been made to fix definitely the line between alterations of the remedy, which are to be deemed legitimate, and those which, under the form of modifying the remedy, impair substantial rights. Every case must be determined upon its own circumstances'; 'In all such cases the question becomes, therefore, one of reasonableness, and of that the legislature is primarily the judge'; 'The question is not whether the legislative action affects contracts incidentally, or directly or indirectly, but \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 383]\n\u00a0\n whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end'; 'If it be determined, as it must be, that the contract clause is not an absolute an utterly unqualified restriction of the state's protective power, this legislation is clearly so reasonable as to be within the legislative competency'.\n The Blaisdell decision represented a realistic appreciation of the fact that ours is an evolving society and that the general words of the contract clause were not intended to reduce the legislative branch of government to helpless impotency. See Veix v. Sixth Ward Building & Loan Association, \n310 \nU.S. 32, 38\n, 60 S.Ct. 792, 794. Whether the contract clause held been given too broad a construction in judicial opinions prior to the Blaisdell decision is not now material. And whether I believe that the language quoted from the Blaisdell opinion constitutes the ultimate criteria upon which legislation should be measured I need not now discuss. For I am of opinion that the Arkansas statute, passed in pursuance of a general public policy of that state, comes well within the permissible area of state legislation as that area is defined by the Blaisdell case and the decisions upon which that case rests. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 384]\n\u00a0\n As has already been pointed out the forfeiture in the case at bar was wholly invalid under what was the governing law at the time of such forfeiture. That invalidity was rendered unavailing to the land's former owners-and to all other owners similarly situated-by the 1935 act. As has also been pointed out, experience evidently demonstrated to the legislature that the best interest of all the people of the state was not served by the change effected by the 1935 act; hence its repeal in 1937. In Arkansas, as appellants argue here, 'these actions to cancel tax deeds are in their essential nature nothing more or less than suits to redeem the property ....' And it has long been recognized as the law in Arkansas that 'the right to redeem lands from a tax-sale depends upon the statute in force at the date of the sale.' Thompson v. Sherrill, 51 Ark. 453, 458, 11 S.W. 689, 690; Groves v. Keene, 105 Ark. 40, 43, 150 S.W. 575. At the time of the forfeiture and  le to the state, Arkansas law protected the purchaser by providing that he should be reimbursed and made whole in case his tax purchase was set aside for irregularity. That protection is today afforded to the full extent that it was when ap- \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 385]\n\u00a0\n pellants bought the land; the repealing act of which appellants complain did not take away any part of that right. From all of this it is manifest that the entire plan of the state in connection with tax sales, both before and after the repealing act of 1937, shows a scrupulous desire to provide compensation for the purchaser in order that he may not suffer pecuniary loss, whatever may be the consequences of a suit for the land. And the whole course of legislation in Arkansas shows a desire to be fair both to the purchaser of tax forfeited land and to the former owners whose land is about to be lost by reason of the drastic device of forfeiture. Cf. Curtis v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68, 71. I cannot believe that the true intent and interpretation of the contract clause prohibits Arkansas from making such an effort to preserve the rights of both the landowner and the one who claims the landowner's forfeited property. Arkansas has not here taken away appellants' 'entire remedy' but has done so 'in part only.' Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 370, 378. I am willing to concede that there may be a 'vast disproportion between the value of the land and the sum for which it is usually bid off at such sales.' Curtis v. Whitney, supra, 13 Wall. at page 70. But assuming that the tax forfeited land here was obtained at such a bargain, I am still of the opinion that these appellants-who have the right to their money, with interest-have been denied no right guaranteed by the contract clause. And in this connection it is not to be forgotten that appellants could have obtained a perfect title by openly and adversely holding possession of the land for two years-a privilege which the state courts finally and authoritatively found had not been exercised. Tax sold properties are undoubtedly bought with the knowledge on the part of those who speculate15 in them that states ordinarily \n\n[313 \nU.S. 362, 386]\n\u00a0\n adopt a liberal policy in order to protect property owners from tax forfeiture. And even granting that we could enter into questions of policy, I would be unable to reach the conclusion that Arkansas, by repealing its 1935 statute, acted 'without ... reason or in a spirit of oppression.' W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56, 60\n, 55 S.Ct. 555, 556, 557, 97 A.L.R. 905. It would seem to me to be difficult to support an argument that Arkansas was acting either unreasonably, unjustly, oppressively, or counter to sound public policy in adopting a law which, without depriving purchasers of the right to recover their money outlay, with interest, sought to make the way easy for former home owners and property owners of all types to reacquire possession and ownership of forfeited property. If under the contract clause it is justifiable to seek to find 'a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare', Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, 290 U.S. at page 442, 54 S.Ct. at page 241, 88 A.L.R. 1481, then it seems to me that this is a case for the application of that principle. I do not believe that the Arkansas legislaure is prohibited by the Federal Constitution from adopting the public policy which the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court has upheld in this case. 'Especial respect should be had to such decisions when the dispute arises out of general laws of a state, regulating its exercise of the taxing power, or relating to the state's disposition of its public lands.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act 142 of 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act 264 of 1937.\n The words of the Act are: 'That Act 142 of the Acts of 1935 be and the same is hereby repealed.' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Ark., 143 S.W.2d 880. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Pope's Digest 1937,  13849. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Id.,  13853. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Id.,  13855. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Id.,  13868. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Id.,  13876. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Id.,  8610, 8620. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Carle v.

That question, however, is not material to the point here under discussion. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The only part of the Blaisdell decision mentioned by the Court in the case at bar is a passage quoting a statement which in Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, the Chief Justice quoted from Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550, 552: 'the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.' The Court now quotes this language as the governing law. In the Blaisdell case, however, the Chief Justice followed the quotation with this statement: 'But this broad language cannot be taken without qualification. Chief Justice Marshall pointed out the distinction between obligation and remedy. Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, 4 Wheat. (122), (page) 200. Said he: 'The distinction between the obligation of a contract, and the remedy given by the legislature to enforce that obligation, has been taken at the bar, and exists in the nature of things. Without impairing the obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be modified as the wisdom of the nation shall direct.\" Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, 290 U.S. at page 430, 54 S.Ct. at page 237, 88 A.L.R. 1481. And Chief Justice Marshall, elaborating his views of this same subject in his dissenting opinion in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 343, 353, said: 'We have, then, no hesitation in saying that, however law may act upon contracts, it does not enter into them, and become a part of the agreement. The effect of such a principle would be a mischievous abridgment of legislative power over subjects within the proper jurisdiction of states, by arresting their power to repeal or modify such laws with respect to existing contracts. ... We think, that obligation and remedy are distinguishable from each other. That the first is created by the act of the parties, the last is afforded by government.' \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Treat v.

X of the Chandler Act1, 52 Stat. 840, 883, 11 U.S.C.A.  501 et seq., to disallow claims for compensation and reimbursement on the grounds that the claimants were serving dual or conflicting interests. The claimants, respondents here, are an indenture trustee, a bondholders' committee, and the committee's counsel. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 264]\n\u00a0\n Counsel to the committee was also counsel to the indenture trustee; and its services in the latter capacity were included in the claim of the indenture trustee. The bankruptcy trustee appeared in opposition to the allowance of these claims, and counterclaimed against the indenture trustee seeking to surcharge it for various alleged acts of misconduct and negligence. The indenture trustee answered. There was a hearing on the claims and on the counterclaim. The District Court disallowed the claims 'for want of equity'; and allowed the counterclaim only as a recoupment to extinguish any claims of respondents. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. In re Granada Apartments, 7 Cir., 111 F.2d 834. It held that there was no conspiracy to defraud nor substantial evidence of mismanagement or negligence on the part of respondent-trustee. It thereupon remanded the cause to the District Court, indicating that the out-of-pocket expenses should be allowed in full and that the reasonable and customary charge for services so rendered should govern the claims for compensation. We granted the petition for writs of certiorari2 in view of the importance in reorganization proceedings of the power of the District Court over such allowances.\n We are not inclined to question the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of fraud. We agree with it that on this record recovery on the counterclaim would not be warranted. But we do not believe it was justified in disregarding the evidence and findings of fact as respects respondents' dual or conflicting interests in this reorganization. \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 265]\n\u00a0\n The property here involved is an apartment hotel-Granada Apartments, Inc.

Two of these were officers or employees of one of the principal underwriters of the bonds. \n4\n This under-writer was heavily interested in the equity. \n5\n So far as appears, that fact was not disclosed when the committee solicited the bondholders. In any event, the equity owner is peculiarly ill-suited to represent the mortgagee in these situations because of their historic clash of interests. See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 1. Furthermore, a rather serious question was raised early in this reorganization concerning alleged misrepresentations by the under-writers on the sale of the bonds that the furnishings of the hotel were covered by the mortgage. It turned out that they were not; and bondholders' money was used to satisfy the lien outstanding against them. \n6\n Objective scrutiny and full en- \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n forcement of an underwriter's liability requires a committee freed from that underwriter's influence.\n The committee was closely affiliated with the respondent-trustee, which, as we have noted, caused its formation. And respondent-trustee was in turn later appointed as successor trustee under the mortgage on petition of the committee. The committee had as its two most active members officers of the indenture trustee. It was in substance a part of the indenture trustee's reorganization division. \n7\n The indenture trustee was the committee's depositary; it would receive any fees accruing to the committee. Indenture trustees themselves have frequently condemned such entanglements with committees. \n8\n The indenture trustee represents all the bondholders; the committee those who have given it authorizations-in this case about 50 per cent. Where the interests of majorities and minorities do not coincide, the interests of the indenture trustee and the committee will tend to be antagonistic. \n9\n Beyond that is the fact \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 267]\n\u00a0\n that an indenture trustee closely affiliated with a committee shares the committee's conflicts of interest.\n In this case the indenture trustee was also indenture trustee for neighboring apartment properties and dominated the committees representing the bonds of those other companies. Two members of respondent committee were also members of one of those other committees. There was no unitary plan of reorganization for these several properties. But there were dealings between them by their common representatives-dealings attacked by petitioner as unfair to the instant company and defended by respondents as fair.\n That is not all.\n Counsel to the committee was not only counsel to the indenture trustee in this reorganization; it was also counsel to the indenture trustee and the committees for the neighboring properties. And respondent- counsel had acted as general counsel for one of the two principal underwriters10 during the financing of the property here involved; and that underwriter's prospectus was under attack in these proceedings. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Under Ch. X of the Chandler Act the bankruptcy court has plenary power to review all fees and expenses in connection with the reorganization from whatever source they may be payable. \n12\n Reasonable compensation for \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 268]\n\u00a0\n services rendered may be allowed. \n13\n The claimant, however, has the burden of proving their worth. Furthermore, 'reasonable compensation for services rendered' necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of those for whom the claimant purported to act. American United Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. City of Avon Park, \n311 \nU.S. 138\n, 61 S.Ct. 157, decided Nov. 25, 1940. Where a claimant, who represented members of the investing public, was serving more than one master or was subject to conflicting interests, he should be denied compensation. It is no answer to say that fraud or unfairness were not shown to have resulted. Cf. Jackson v. Smith, \n254 \nU.S. 586, 589\n, 41 S.Ct. 200, 201. The principle enunciated by Chief Justice Taft in a case involving a contract to split fees in violation of the bankruptcy rules, is apposite here: 'What is struck at in the refusal to enforce contracts of this kind is not only actual evil results but their tendency to evil in other cases.' Weil v. Neary, \n278 \nU.S. 160, 173\n, 49 S.Ct. 144, 149. Furthermore, the incidence of a particular conflict of interest can seldom be measured with any degree of certainty. The bankruptcy court need not speculate as to whether the result of the conflict was to delay action where speed was essential, to close the record of past transactions where publicity and investigation were needed, to compromise claims by inattention where vigilant assertion was necessary, or otherwise to dilute the undivided loyalty owed to those whom the claimant purported to represent. Where an actual conflict of interest exists, no more need be shown in this type of case to support a denial of compensation.\n Protective committees, as well as indenture trustees, are fiduciaries. Bullard v. City of Cisco, \n290 \nU.S. 179\n, 54 S.Ct. 177, 93 A.L. R. 141; \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 269]\n\u00a0\n Jewett v. Commonwealth Bond Corp., 241 App.Div. 131, 271 N.Y.S. 522; Bergelt v. Roberts, 144 Misc. 832, 258 N.Y.S. 905, affirmed 236 App.Div. 777, 258 N.Y.S. 1086; Carter v. First Nat'l Bank, 128 Md. 581, 98 A. 77. Cf. Nichol v. Sensenbrenner, 220 Wis. 165, 263 N.W. 650. A fiduciary who represents security holders in a reorganization may not perfect his claim to compensation by insisting that although he had conflicting interests, he served his several masters equally well or that his primary loyalty was not weakened by the pull of his secondary one. Only strict adherence to these equitable principles can keep the standard of conduct for fiduciaries 'at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.' See Mr. Justice Cardozo in Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 464, 164 N.E. 545, 546, 62 A.L.R. 1.\n The findings of the District Court that these claimants represented conflicting interests are amply supported by the evidence.\n Some discrimination, however, is necessary in applying the foregoing rule to claims for expenses. Reimbursement for 'proper costs and expenses incurred in connection with the administration' of the estate may be allowed. \n14\n The rule disallowing compensation because of conflicting interests may be equally effective to bar recovery of the expenditures made by a claimant subject to conflicting interests. Plainly expenditures are not 'proper' within the meaning of the Act where the claimant cannot show that they were made in furtherance of a project exclusively devoted to the interests of those whom the claimant purported to represent. On the other hand, those expenditures normally should be allowed which have clearly benefited the estate. Scott on Trusts (1939),  245.1. Thus where taxes have been paid, needful repairs or additions to the property have been made, or the like, equity does not permit the estate \n\n[312 \nU.S. 262, 270]\n\u00a0\n to retain those benefits without paying for them. Such classification of expenses, at times difficult, rests in the sound discretion of the bankruptcy court. The District Court drew no such distinction but proceeded on the theory that reimbursement for all expenses must be denied. But it is not apparent that all of them fall within the prohibited category.\n The other points raised by petitioner are so plainly without merit that they do not warrant mention.\n For the reasons stated we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This reorganization started with foreclosure proceedings in the Illinois state court and later was transferred to the United States District Court upon the filing of petitions under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. Pursuant to  276(c)(2) of the Chandler Act, 11 U. S.C.A.  676(c)(2) the bankruptcy court made that chapter applicable to the allowance of these claims. The claims under review cover not only the proceedings under  77B but also the earlier state court proceedings. Though some of the allowances here in issue apparently had been fixed by the state court prior to the transfer of the proceedings to bankruptcy, respondents agreed to submit the claims de novo to the District Court. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n311 \nU.S. 629\n, 61 S.Ct. 39, 85 L.Ed. --. The two cases raise the same question. One represents an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals as of right; the other an appeal with leave. They were taken prior to our decision in Dickinson Industrial Site v. Cowan, \n309 \nU.S. 382\n, 60 S.Ct. 595. And see Reconstruction Finance Corp. v.

The District Court found that nominees of Cody Trust Co. operated the property until January, 1934.\n The reorganization began with a foreclosure proceeding in the state court. The indenture trustee, predecessor of respondent trustee, later took possession and employed a so-called agent at $50 per month 'to keep Cody Trust Company informed as to the status from time to time.' \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Certain phases of the litigation involving this question are revealed in Thuma v. Granada Hotel Corp., 269 Ill.App. 484; Wenstrand v. Pick & Co., 7 Cir., 38 F.2d 25; In re Granada Apartments, Inc., 7 Cir., 104 F.2d 528.\n So far as appears no effort was made in this reorganization to assert any claim against the underwriters. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] That division had handled over 400 reorganizations, having been formed to act in connection with defaulted bond issues underwritten by Chicago Trust Co. and Central Trust Co. of Illinois. Chicago Trust Co. was one of the underwriters of the Granada bonds. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Utter, Problems of Trustees Under Defaulted Bond Issues, 56 Trust Companies 653 (1933); Littleton, Administration Problems Under Corporate Trusteeship, id., 335, 338. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Utter op. cit. supra note 8, pp. 656-657. That antagonism was best illustrated in foreclosure reorganizations where the minority was not bound to accept new securities but could insist on cash. See Weiner, Conflicting Functions of the Upset Price in a Corporate Reorganization, 27 Col.L.Rev. 132. In the instant case the reorganization proceeding was in the state court from June, 1930 when a receiver under the second mortgage was appointed to May, 1937 when petitions under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act were approved. For an earlier and unsuccessful attempt to place this company under  77B see Tuttle v. Harris, \n297 \nU.S. 225\n, 56 S.Ct. 416. Respondent-indenture trustee became such in January, 1935.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad Company intervened as a defendant.\n Defendants, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, moved to dismiss petitioners' bills for want of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The intervener defendant filed an answer and moved for summary judgment. The District Court dismissed the bills (31 F.Supp. 371) and its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. App.D.C., 114 F.2d 464. We granted certiorari. October 14, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 632\n, 61 S.Ct. 51, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, was set up pursuant to an agreement of August 10, 1922,2 to determine the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of her financial obligations under the Treaty of Berlin of August 25, 1921.3 The Commission consisted of three members, one appointed by the United States, another by Germany, and an Umpire se- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 481]\n\u00a0\n lected by the two Governments. The Umpire was 'to decide upon any cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings'. It was further provided that should the Umpire or any of the Commissioners die or retire, or be unable for any reason to discharge his functions, the vacancy should be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. It was agreed that the decisions of the Commission and those of the Umpire should be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments.\n The Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 created in the Treasury a 'German special deposit account'. Section 2 provided that the Secretary of State should certify from time to time to the Secretary of the Treasury the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission, and the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay out of the amounts placed in the account the principal of each award so certified, with interest as stated.\n The claims covered by the awards attacked by petitioners arose out of the destruction of property caused by explosions at Black Tom and Kingsland, New Jersey, in 1916 and 1917. These claims were dismissed by the Commission in 1930, and petitions for rehearing were denied in 1931 and 1932. In the following year the American agent sought to reopen the cases upon the ground that in its decision of 1930 the Commission had been misled by 'fraudulent, incomplete, collusive and false evidence' on the part of witnesses for Germany. The German Government denied the power of the Commission to reopen and the Umpire, Mr. Justice Roberts, finding that there was a disagreement upon the question between the Commissioners, decided, in December, 1933, that the Commission was competent to determine its own jurisdiction by the interpretation of the Agreement creating it. The Umpire further decided that, while the Com- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 482]\n\u00a0\n mission was without power to reopen a case merely for the presentation of after-discovered evidence, the Commission was still sitting as a court and did have power to consider the charge that it had been misled by fraud and collusion, and for that purpose to reopen the cases in order that it might consider the further evidence tendered by the American agent, and that offered in reply on behalf of Germany, and either confirm the decisions theretofore made or alter them as justice and right might demand.\n Thereafter, the German agent filed an answer denying the allegations of fraud and evidence was presented. After argument, the Commission, in June, 1936, rendered a decision, the German Commissioner concurring, by which the ruling of 1932 denying a rehearing was set aside, and the question whether there should be a rehearing was reserved for a hearing which should be separate and distinct from an argument on the merits unless Germany should consent to a different course.\n Efforts to obtain a settlement of the claims were unsuccessful and, after much additional evidence had been introduced, the Commission, in January, 1939, heard extended arguments by the agents of the respective Governments. The American agent had requested that the Commission should not only set aside the original decision of 1930 but should also proceed to a final decision on the merits, as it was contended that the evidence presented to support the application for rehearing also established the responsibility of Germany for the destruction of the property as claimed. It also appears that the German Commissioner insisted that, before the motion for rehearing should be granted, the Commission should examine the proofs tendered by the United States to determine whether the claims had been made good. This, as stated by the Umpire, was upon the ground that even though the Commission had been misled by false and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 483]\n\u00a0\n fraudulent testimony, that would be immaterial if, upon an independent consideration, the United States in its own cases had failed to sustain its burden of proof. The American Commissioner and the Umpire thereupon had agreed to go beyond what they thought the necessary function of the Commission in the circumstances and had proceeded to canvass with the German Commissioner the cases as made by the United States.\n During the course of that investigation, on March 1, 1939, the German Commissioner withdrew from the Commission. At the time of his withdrawal, to two Commissioners, according to the contention of the American Commissioner and as found by the Umpire, were in disagreement upon the points in issue. On receiving notice of a meeting of the Commission to be held on June 15, 1939, the German agent said that he would not appear and the German Embassy advised the Secretary of State that, since the withdrawal of the German Commissioner, the Commission was incompetent to make decisions.\n At the meeting held pursuant to the notice, the American Commissioner filed a certificate of disagreement with an opinion sustaining the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Umpire thereupon decided that there did exist a disagreement between the two Commissioners,-a disagreement of which he was personally cognizant and which was also shown by the certiicate and opinion of the American Commissioner; that the jurisdiction of the Commission was not ousted by the withdrawal of the German Commissioner 'after submission by the parties, and after the tribunal, having taken the cases under advisement, pursuant to its rules, was engaged in the task of deciding the issues presented'; that the United States 'had proved its allegation that fraud in the evidence presented by Germany misled the Commission and affected its decision in favor of Germany'; and that upon \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 484]\n\u00a0\n the record as it then stood the cases for the claims were made out.\n Thereupon, the American agent moved for awards in favor of the United States on behalf of the sabotage claimants. An order was entered setting aside the decision of 1930, and determining that the liability of Germany had been established and that, as it appeared that Germany did not intend to take part in further proceedings of the Commission, awards should be made upon the Commission's findings and opinion.\n On October 3, 1939, the German Charge d'Affaires addressed an elaborate communication to the Secretary of State making a detailed statement supplementary to a note of July 11, 1939, with respect to the alleged illegal acts of the Umpire, and protesting against all further measures by the Umpire, the American Commissioner and the American agent, which were aimed at securing awards in the Black Tom and Kingsland cases. The Secretary of State replied, on October 18, 1939, that it would be highly inappropriate for the Department to endeavor to determine the course of the proceedings of the Commission; that the Secretary had entire confidence in the ability and integrity of the Umpire and the Commissioner appointed by the United States despite the severe and, as he believed, 'entirely unwarranted criticisms', and that he was constrained to invite attention to the fact 'that the remarkable action of the Commissioner appointed by Germany was apparently designed to frustrate or postpone indefinitely the work of the Commission at a time when, after years of labor on the particular cases involved, it was expected that its functions would be brought to a conclusion.'\n Notice was given of a meeting of the Commission to be held on October 30, 1939, which the German Commissioner did not attend, and awards were then made in favor of the claimants. The Umpire stated that he \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 485]\n\u00a0\n had found the awards to be accurately and properly calculated and had joined the American Commissioner in signing them.\n The awards were certified by the Secretary of State to the Secretary of the Treasury on October 31, 1939, pursuant to the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928. On the same day, this suit was brought, the complaint being filed before, and process being served on the Secretary of State after, his certification of the awards.\n The Court of Appeals has held that the question with respect to the validity of the awards in favor of the sabotage claimants is political in its nature and that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.\n There are, however, certain preliminary questions which are indubitably appropriate for judicial consideration, and we think that the proper answer to these questions is determinative of the whole case.\n The first question is whether petitioners have standing to bring this suit. Except for the situation created by the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, they would have no such standing. They could not be heard to complain of action upon claims other than their own. And Congress, with or without awards, could provide for the payment of the claims in question without let or hindrance by petitioners. But petitioners contend that the Settlement of War Claims Act created a fund in the Treasury, known as the 'German special deposit account'; that petitioners with other earlier award-holders are entitled by the Act to payment out of that fund; that the fund is insufficient to pay petitioners' claims in full if payments are permitted to be made to the sabotage claimants; and hence that petitioners have standing to complain of an unlawful depletion of the fund to their injury by means of such payments.\n We think that in these circumstances as shown by the bills petitioners are entitled to sue to protect such inter- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 486]\n\u00a0\n ests as they may have under the Act. Compare Houston v. Ormes, \n252 \nU.S. 469\n, 40 S.Ct. 369; Mellon v. Orinoco Iron Co., \n266 \nU.S. 121\n, 45 S.Ct. 53. But as their standing rests solely upon the provisions of the Act, they may not escape its terms or succeed in a challenge to payments for which the Act is found to provide.\n The next question is with respect to the effect that should be given under the terms of the statute to the action of the Secretary of State in certifying the awards. Congress has authorized and required the Secretary of the Treasury to pay out of the special account the awards which the Secretary of State has certified. There is no question that the Secretary of State has given his certificate in this instance. It is adequate in form and substance under the terms of the Act.\n Petitioners contend that the certification is a mere ministerial act. It is said to mean merely that the award is a genuine document, in the same sense that a notary public authenticates the signature of a grantor in a deed. We think that this construction of the Act is inadmissible. The notarial conception of the function of the Secretary of State in this matter ignores his role in the conduct of foreign affairs as the right hand of the Executive and in particular his relation to proceedings for the determination of claims of the United States against foreign governments. There can be no doubt of the constitutional authority of Congress to lodge with the Secretary of State the authority to consider and pass upon the regularity and validity of the awards made by the Mixed Claims Commission for the statutory purpose of qualifying them for payment out of the account in the Treasury. Congress had complete power to decide what payments should be made from that account and to attach such conditions as it saw fit. Congress not only had this power but it was natural and appropriate that Congress should entrust to the Secretary of State the decision \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 487]\n\u00a0\n of questions that might arise with respect to the propriety of the payment of awards made by the Commission and to require his affirmative action through certification before payment. The Mixed Claims Commission had been created by an executive agreement. The claims to be considered by the Commission were only those sponsored and presented by the United States against Germany. They were presented as claims of the United States, the national claimants themselves having no standing save as they were represented by the United States. See Frelinghuysen v. Key, \n110 \nU.S. 63, 75\n, 76 S., 3 S.Ct. 462, 469, 470; United States ex rel. Boynton v. Blaine, \n139 \nU.S. 306, 323\n, 325 S., 11 S.Ct. 607, 613, 614; Williams v. Heard, \n140 \nU.S. 529, 537\n, 538 S., 11 S.Ct. 885, 886, 887. The claims so sponsored were presented and handled by an American agent appointed by the President. It was obvious, as the present contentions abundantly illustrate, that the proceedings before such a commission might easily give rise to questions between the governments concerned and might involve diplomatic representations or protests with which it would be the duty of the Secretary of State to deal. Whatever might be said of such representations or protests, or the occasion for them, or with respect to the existence of any international right or obligation arising from the agreement setting up the Commission, Congress could, and naturally would, require the views of the Secretary of State before appropriating money for the payment of awards, and, in creating a special fund for that purpose, would look to the Secretary of State for the exercise of his appropriate authority on behalf of the Executive and thus for his judgment upon the question whether the proceedings had been such as duly to qualify the awards for payment. See Frelinghuysen v. Key, supra; United States ex rel. Boynton v. Blaine, supra. We find nothing in the Settlement of War Claims Act which points to a different purpose. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 488]\n\u00a0\n It is suggested that the Secretary of State construed his action in certifying as merely ministerial because he acted at once on the presentation of the awards. But the argument overlooks the fact that the Secretary of State had long been cognizant of the questions that had arisen in relation to the Commission's authority to grant a rehearing and make the awards. As early as October, 1933, the German Government had notified the Secretary of State that it regarded the Commission as without authority to grant a rehearing on the sabotage claims. The Secretary of State had informed the American agent that the question of jurisdiction was one properly to be decided by the Commission itself and he directed the American agent to bring the matter to the attention of the American Commissioner, or the full Commission, for the purpose of obtaining the decision of the Umpire on that disputed point. In March, 1939, the American Commissioner informed the Secretary of State of the withdrawal of the German Commissioner and reviewed the circumstances. In June, 1939, petitioners themselves formally communicated to the Secretary of State their objections to the proceedings. In the same month the German Embassy advised the Secretary of State that its Government regarded the Commission as incompetent to make decisions because of the German Commissioner's withdrawal. This was followed by a further protest delivered to the Secretary of State in July and a detailed statement by the German Government of its grounds in its communication of October 3, 1939, to which the Secretary of State replied on October 18, 1939, in the note from which we have quoted. Thus, when the actual awards were presented the Secretary of State had before him these diplomatic representations and was fully conversant with all the proceedings of the Commission, with the action of the German Commissioner and the attitude of his Government, and with the contentions of peti- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 489]\n\u00a0\n tioners. We find no basis for concluding that the Secretary of State in certifying the awards did not act after due deliberation or fail to express his considerate judgment, as we think the statute contemplated.\n We are of the opinion that for the purpose of payment under the statute the certificate of the Secretary of State must be deemed to be conclusive. We do not need to consider whether Congress could commit to the judiciary the determination of the validity of the challenged claims ( see La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423\n, 20 S.Ct. 168), for Congress has not done so but has made payment out of the fund depend upon the Secretary's certificate. The question in this relation is simply one of the intent of Congress as disclosed by the Act. Congress has expressly directed payments to be made from the special account of the awards 'so certified'. The literal and natural import of this provision is that finality is to be accorded to the certificate of the Secretary of State and we perceive no ground for limiting the terms of the Act by construction. On the contrary, the nature of the questions presented and their relation to the conduct of foreign affairs within the province of the Secretary of State support the conclusion that the statute should have effect according to its explicit terms.\n In view of the statutory provisions governing this case, we have no occasion to consider the circumstances in which an international agreement, or action thereunder, may be deemed to vest rights in private persons, or the scope of such rights in particular cases. See Comegys v. Vasse, 1 Pet. 193; Mellon v. Orinoco Iron Co., supra. Petitioners must claim solely by virtue of their interest in the fund created by the statute and under its terms they are not entitled to complain of payments out of that fund of awards which the Secretary of State has certified.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 490]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK (concurring).\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and I concur in the judgment of affirmance but on the ground that the petitioners set up no justiciable controversy which the court had power to determine. The questions raised by the petitions involve relations between the United States and Germany, which we believe are constitutionally committed exclusively to the legislative and executive departments.\n The sole ground upon which petitioners prayed relief in the District Court was that awards made by the Mixed Claims Commission were 'wholly null and void and without jurisdiction on the part of the alleged Commission.' A declaratory judgment was sought to have the awards declared null and void, and to enjoin the Secretary of State from certifying and the Secretary of the Treasury from paying such awards made by the Commission. In addition petitioners asked a mandatory injunction to require the Secretary of the Treasury to pay petitioners without regard to other awards of the Commission certified by the Secretary of State.\n The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury moved to dismiss on the grounds, among others, that the complaint stated no cause of action; the court had no jurisdiction to review the action of the Mixed Claims Commission; the court was without power to pass upon the jurisdiction of the Mixed Claims Commission; and the court had no jurisdiction to restrain the Secretary of State from certifying awards of the Commission or to enjoin the Secretary of the Treasury from paying the claims so certified. The District Court dismissed and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the actions of the Mixed Claims Commission in making awards and the Secretary of State in certifying. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 491]\n\u00a0\n them were committed for determination to the political department of government and therefore the courts were without power to review their determination. We agree with their conclusion. And in this view we believe the certifications of the Secretary of State must be deemed final and conclusive in the courts, not because the conduct of the Secretary and the Commission preceding certification meets approval of the courts, but because power to make final determination rests with the political departments of government alone.\n The fundamental questions raised by the petitions as presented to the District Court, were: Who can challenge the propriety of the Commission's awards? Does the judicial branch of government, rather than the political, possess the power finally to determine the propriety of the awards? And the fact that petitioners sought to challenge the Commission's power by proceedings against the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, and not by direct suit against the Commission, is immaterial. If petitioners cannot directly attack the Commission in the courts, neither can they, in the absence of Congressional consent, assail the propriety of its awards through the expedient of suits against others charged with responsibility for executing the final determination of the Commission.\n The Mixed Claims Commission was set up pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Germany. The agreement gave the Commission full power to hold hearings to determine 'the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations' under two treaties previously made between the two countries. The agreement further provided that 'the decisions of the Commission and those of the Umpire (in case there may be any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two governments.' The Commission was set up with an Umpire and all of the awards \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 492]\n\u00a0\n were reported to the Secretary of State by the Commission.\n While petitioners contend that they have the right to challenge the certification of the Secretary of State, it is to be remembered that their petitions ultimately rest solely upon the premise that it is his duty to refuse to carry out the Commission's awards because of alleged impropriety of the proceedings of the Commission. They say that the Commission was without jurisdiction and power to make awards to certain claimants other than themselves; payment of these awards out of a fund that is limited in amount will result in diminishing payments to them below the full amount of their award with interest; since the Commission was without power-as they charge-to make these other awards, the Secretary of State should not have certified them for payment; and for the same reason the Treasury should not pay them. They assert a right through court procedure to challenge payment to the other claimants by reason of an Act of Congress of 1928.1\n But the 1928 Act provides that the Secretary shall from time to time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission of the United States, and that the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay 'the principal of each award so certified, plus the interest thereon, in accordance with the award, ....' Nowhere in the Act is there any language which either expressly or by fair implication indicates a purpose of Congress to permit some claimants to resort to the courts-as petitioners here have done-to determine the propriety of awards by the Mixed Claims Commission to other claimants.\n The exact challenge made by petitioners against the awards of the Commission is the subject of a diplomatic \n\n[311 \nU.S. 470, 493]\n\u00a0\n controversy between the United States and Germany. Germany's contention is the same as petitioners'. And the Secretary of State, in charge of our foreign affairs, has declined to accede to Germany's contention that the particular awards here in controversy were improper and should not be certified or paid. The immediate subject matter of petitioners' complaint, upon which rests the power of the Court to act, if it has any power, has therefore been repudiated by the political branch of our government. A contrary conclusion by the courts would bring about a square clash between the executive and judicial branches of government. And far more than this. Whoever is entrusted finally to determine what government must or must not do in a dispute between nations is the ultimate arbiter of momentous questions of public policies affecting this nation's relations with the other countries of the world.\n The controversy here bears all the earmarks of that type of controversies which our Constitution has confided exclusively to the executive or political departments of government, and concerning which this Court has many times repeated 'that the action of the political branches of the government, in a matter that belongs to them, is conclusive.' \n2\n Since this clearly appeared from the face of the pleadings at the very outset, the District Court properly stayed its hands and renounced power to proceed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 Stat. 254. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 42 Stat. 2200. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 42 Stat. 1939. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 Stat. 254. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Williams v.
