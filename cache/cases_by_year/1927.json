The petitioner is a bond house doing a large business, and the only evidence of its having made such a contract was the testimony of the plaintiff that Mather, a salesman, made the promise on the petitioner's behalf, coupled with a letter the admissibility of which is the question here. The purchases were on June 19, 1920, September 23, 1920, and February 28, 1921. The plaintiff testified that on May 9, 1921, he wrote to the petitioner that when he made the second purchase 'it was agreed by Mr. Mather that at any time I so desired you would take them off my hands at cost 98. I have need of some money and will avail myself of this privilege. When shall I deliver them to you.' The officers of the petitioner denied ever having received the letter and denied the authority of Mather to make any such agreement. It may be mentioned further, although it is not relevant to the question here, that Mather denied having made the contracts alleged. The letter was offered in evidence. It was objected to as a self-serving document but was admitted subject to exceptions. There was no other evidence of Mather's authority, but the jury were instructed that if the petitioner received the letter and failed to disaffirm what Peirson said Mather had done they would be justified in finding that the petitioner acquiesced in the agreement and that Mather had authority to do what Peirson said he did. The plaintiff got a verdict and judgment and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 16 F. (2d) 86. On a suggestion of conflict between this and other Circuit Courts of Appeal and of failure to conform to the rule of evidence in Pennsylvania (a failure in no way affected by the fact that the same rule prevails in most Courts of high authority), as also of a difference among the Courts as to the scope of the Conformity Acts, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n273 \nU.S. 676\n, 47 S. Ct. 95.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 120, 128]\n\u00a0\n A man cannot make evidence for himself by writing a letter containing the statements that he wishes to prove. He does not make the letter evidence by sending it to the party against whom he wishes to prove the facts. He no more can impose a duty to answer a charge than he can impose a duty to pay by sending goods. Therefore a failure to answer such adverse assertions in the absence of further circumstances making an answer requisite or natural has no effect as an admission. Fraley v. Bispham, 10 Pa. 320, 51 Am. Dec. 486; Kann v. Bennett, 223 Pa. 36, 47, 72 A. 342; Packer v. United States (C. C. A.) 106 F. 906; Woolsey v. Haynes (C. C. A.) 165 F. 391; Thrush v. Fullhart (C. C. A.) 210 F. 1, 6; Harris v. Egger (C. C. A.) 226 F. 389, 399; Kumin v. Fine, 229 Mass. 75, 118 N. E. 187, 8 A. L. R. 1161; Viele v. McLean, 200 N. Y. 260, 93 N. E. 468; Richards v. Gellatly, L. R. 7, C. P. 127, 131; Wiedemann v. Walpole, (1891) 2 Q. B. 534, 539; Thomas v. Jones, (1920) 2 K. B. 399; (1921) 1 K. B. 22.\n There were no circumstances in this case to take it out of the general rule. The letter might have been admissible as a demand if a binding contract had been proved, but until evidence of Mather's authority was given the demand was immaterial. It is true that two days after that on which the plaintiff says that he wrote the letter that we have quoted the petitioner lent to the plaintiff $15,000 on the security of the $20, 000 bonds in question with the usual powers of sale and the plaintiff's note. It would be the merest speculation to regard the plaintiff's story as confirmed by this loan. It may as probably have been an independent transaction, and it might be argued at least as plausibly that the plaintiff's note and assent to the severe conditions of a pledge to brokers was inconsistent with the right that he now asserts. No evidence having been given of Mather's authority to make the contract in suit the petitioner was entitled to a verdict. The request that one should be directed should have been granted. A new trial must be awarded.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALBRECHT v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 16\nArgued: November 23, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles A. Houts, of St. Louis, Mo., and David E. Keefe, of East St. Louis, Ill., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This direct writ of error to the federal court for Eastern Illinois, was allowed under section 238 of the Judicial Code prior to the amendment of February 13, 1925 (Comp. St.  1215). Albrecht and his associates were sentenced to either fine or imprisonment upon each of nine counts of an information charging violations of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St .  10138 1\/4 et seq.). \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n There is no contention that the offenses charged could not be prosecuted by information. See Brede v. Powers, \n263 \nU.S. 4, 10\n, 44 S. Ct. 8; Rossini v. United States (C. C. A.) 6 F.(2d) 350. The claims mainly urged are that, because of defects in the information and affidavits attached, there was no jurisdiction in the District Court and that rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment were violated. Several important questions of practice are presented which have not been passed upon by this Court, and on which there has been diversity of opinion in the lower courts, due in part to language in the opinions in United States v. Morgan, \n222 \nU.S. 274, 282\n, 32 S. Ct. 81, and in United States v. Thompson, \n251 U.S. 407\n, 413-414, 40 S. Ct. 289.\n The information recites that it was filed by the United States attorney with leave of the court, and the truth of this allegation has not been questioned. A bench warrant issued, and the marshal executed it by arresting the defendants. When they were brought into court, each gave bond to appear and answer, was released from custody immediately, and was not thereafter in custody by virtue of the warrant or otherwise. At the time of giving the bonds, no objection was made to either the jurisdiction or the service by execution of the warrant, and nothing was done then indicating an intention to enter a special appearance. On a later day, the defendants filed a motion to quash the information, declared in the motion that they 'specifically limit their appearance in the cause for the purpose of interposing' it, and protested that the court was without jurisdiction. The main ground urged in support of the objection was that the information had not been verified by the United States attorney; that it recited he 'gives the court to understand and be informed, on the affidavit of I. A. Miller and D. P. Coggins'; and that these affidavits, which were annexed to the information, had been sworn to before a notary public-a state official not authorized to admin- \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n ister oaths in federal criminal proceedings. Compare United States v. Hall, \n131 \nU.S. 50\n, 9 S. Ct. 663. With leave of court, new oaths to the affidavits were immediately sworn to before the deputy clerk of the court, and additional affidavits, also sworn to before him, were filed. Thereupon a new motion to quash, setting forth the same grounds, was filed by the defendants, and this motion extended to both the information and the warrant. It also was denied, and a demurrer interposed upon the same ground was overruled. Then, upon a plea of not guilty, the defendants were tried, with the result stated, and a motion in arrest of judgment was denied.\n As the affidavits on which the warrant issued had not been properly verified, the arrest was in violation of the clause in the Fourth Amendment, which declares that 'no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.' See Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch, 448, 453; United States v. Michalski (D. C.) 265 F. 839. But it does not follow that, because the arrest was illegal, the information was or became void. The information was filed by leave of court. Despite some practice and statements to the contrary, it may be accepted as settled that leave must be obtained, and that, before granting leave, the court must, in some way, satisfy itself that there is probable cause for the prosecution. \n1\n This is done some- \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n times by a verification of the information, and frequently by annexing affidavits thereto. But these are not the only means by which a court may become satisfied that probable cause for the prosecution exists. \n2\n The United States attorney, like the Attorney General or Solicitor General of England, may file an information under his oath of office, and, if he does so, his official oath may be accepted as sufficient to give verity to the allegations of the information. See Weeks v. United States (C. C. A.) 216 F. 292, 302, L. R. A. 1918B, 651, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 524.\n It is contended that this information was not presented on the official oath of the United States attorney; that, instead of informing on his official oath, he gave 'the court to understand and be informed on the affidavit (s)' referred to, and that, for this reason, the information is to be likened, not to those filed in England by the Attorney General or the Solicitor General, but to those exhibited there by Masters of the Crown upon information of a private informer; that the latter class of informa- \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n tions were required by Stat. 4 & 5 W. & M. c. 18, to be supported by affidavit of the person at whose instance they were preferred; that this requirement for informations of that character became a part of our common law; and, that, because the affidavits were not properly verified, the information could not confer jurisdiction.\n The practice of prosecuting lesser federal crimes by information, instead of indictment, has been common since 1870.3 But, in federal proceedings, no trace has been found of the differentiation in informations for such crimes, or of any class of informations instituted by a private informer comparable to those dealt with in England by Stat. 4 & 5 W. & M. c. 18.\n The reference to the affidavits in this information is not to be read as indicating that it was presented otherwise than upon the oath of office of the United States attorney. \n4\n The affidavits were doubtless referred to in \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n the information, not as furnishing probable cause for the prosecution, but because it was proposed to use the information and affidavits annexed as the basis for an application for a warrant of arrest. If before granting the warrant, the defendants had entered a voluntary appearance, the reference and the affidavits could have been treated as surplusage, and would not have vitiated the information. \n5\n The fact that the information and affidavits were used as a basis for the application for a warrant did not affect the validity of the information as such. \n6\n Whether the whole proceeding was later vitiated by the false arrest remains to be considered.\n The invalidity of the warrant is not comparable to the invalidity of an indictment. A person may not be punished for a crime without a formal and sufficient accusation even if he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the court. Compare Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S. Ct. 781. But a false arrest does not necessarily deprive the court of jurisdiction of the proceeding in which it was made. Where there was an appropriate accusation either by indictment or information, a court may acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant by his voluntary appearance. \n7\n That a defendant may be brought before the court by a summons, without an arrest, is shown by the practice in prosecutions against corporations which are necessarily commenced by a summons. \n8\n Here, the court had juris- \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n diction of the subject-matter; and the persons named as defendants were within its territorial jurisdiction. The judgment assailed would clearly have been good, if the objection had not been taken until after the verdict. \n9\n This shows that the irregularity in the warrant was of such a character that it could be waived. Was it waived? And, if not, was it cured?\n The bail bonds bound the defendants to 'be and appear' in court 'from day to day' and 'to answer and stand trial upon the information herein and to stand by and abide the orders and judgment of the court in the premises.' It is urged there was a waiver by giving the bail bonds without making any objection. We are of the opinion that the failure to take the objection at that time did not waive the invalidity of the warrant or operate as a general appearance. \n10\n An objection to the illegality \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n of the arrest could have been taken thereafter by a motion to quash the warrants, though technically the defendants were then held under their bonds, the warrants having performed their functions. But the first motion to quash was not directed to the invalidity of the warrant. As that motion to quash was directed solely to the information, it could not raise the question of the validity of the warrant. \n11\n The motion to quash the warrant was not made until after the government had filed properly verified affidavits by leave of court. Thereby the situation had been changed. The affidavits then on file would have supported a new warrant, which, if issued, would plainly have validated the proceedings thenceforward. Compare In re Johnson, \n167 \nU.S. 120\n, 17 S. Ct. 735. There was no occasion to apply for a new warrant, because the defendants were already in court. \n12\n The defect in the proceeding by which they had been brought into court had been cured. By failing to move to quash the warrant before the defect had been cured, the defendants lost their right to object. It is thus unnecessary to decide whether it would have been proper to allow the amendment, and deny the mo- \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n tion to quash, if the attack on the warrant had been made before the amendment of the affidavits. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n There is a claim of violation of the Fifth Amendment by the imposition of double punishment. This contention rests upon the following facts. Of the nine counts in the information four charged illegal possession of liquor, four illegal sale, and one maintaining a common nuisance. The contention is that there was double punishment because the liquor which the defendants were convicted for having sold is the same that they were convicted for having possessed. But possessing and selling are distinct offenses. One may obviously possess without selling, and one may sell and cause to be delivered a thing of which he has never had possession, or one may have possession and later sell, as appears to have been done in this case. The fact that the person sells the liquor which he possessed does not render the possession and the sale necessarily a single offense. There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents Congress from punishing separately each step leading to the consummation of a transaction which it has power to prohibit and punishing also the completed transaction. The precise question does not appear to have been discussed in either this or a lower federal court in connection with the National Prohibition Act; but the general principle is well established. \n\n[273 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Compare Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 377\n, 26 S. Ct. 688, 6 Ann. Cas. 392; Gavieres v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 338\n, 31 S. Ct. 421; Morgan v. Devine, \n237 \nU.S. 632\n, 35 S. Ct. 712\n\n\n The remaining objections are unsubstantial and do not require discussion.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The great majority of the lower courts dealing with the subject have insisted that the district attorney secure leave of court before filing informations, and have refused to grant leave except upon a showing of probable cause.

In some districts the United States attorney has been permitted to file an information upon a purely formal allegation of leave, but the court determined the question of the existence of probable cause upon a motion of the defendant to withdraw leave. United States v. Simon (D. C.) 248 F. 980; Yaffee v. United States (C. C. A.) 276 F. 497. The statements in Ryan v. United States (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 667, and Miller v. United States (C. C. A.) 6 F.( 2d) 463, that the United States attorney may file informations as of right, are based upon an incidental remark in United States v. Thompson, \n251 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 414 S., 40 S. Ct. 289, which must be disregarded. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A few cases have considered a verification essential to the validity of an information. United States v. Tureaud (C.

United States v. Shepard, Fed. Cas. No. 16,273; United States v. Cultus Joe, Fed. Cas. No. 15,478. See also 2 Abbot's United States Practice, 177. Story, writing in 1833, said that there was very little use of informations except in civil prosecutions for penalties and forfeitures. The Constitution,  1780. In 1864, Congress passed a statute which provided for a summary criminal proceeding, begun by sworn complaint, in cases involving minor offenses by seamen. Act of June 11, 1864, c. 121,  2, 3, 13 Stat. 124 (Comp. St.  8046, 8047). In 1870 was passed a statute authorizing prosecution by indictment or information for crimes against the franchise. Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114,  8, 16 Stat. 142 (Comp. St.  1686). While there was probably a sporadic use of informations in criminal proceedings during the first 80 years of the government, as in United States v. Mann, Fed. Cas. No. 15,717 (1812), the use did not become general until after 1870. After 1870 prosecutions by information became frequent. See United States v. Waller, Fed. Cas. No. 16,634; United States v.

United States (C. C.

In United States v. Shepard, Fed. Cas. No. 16,273, and United States v. Wells (D. C.) 225 F. 320, the court quashed informations because of the illegality of the arrest, though the defendants had given bond without objecting to the illegality, but the question of waiver was apparently not pressed upon the courts. The trend of authority in the state courts does not consider that giving bond is a waiver, since the defendant must give bond or go to jail, and will ordinarily have little knowledge of his legal rights. People v. Gardner, 71 Misc. Rep. 335, 130 N. Y. S. 202; State v. Simmons, 39 Kan. 262, 18 P. 177 (but compare State v. Munson, 111 Kan. 318, 206 P. 749). Compare Solomon v.

It is of course possible that giving bail plus very little else may amount to a waiver. Ard v. State, 114 Ind. 542, 16 N. E. 504; State v. McLain, 13 N. D. 368, 102 N. W. 407. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] There has been confusion as to the proper method of taking an objection to an illegal arrest. Some cases in the lower federal courts have apparently allowed it to be taken by a motion to quash the information or indictment. United States v. Illig (D. C.) 288 F. 939. Compare United States v.

Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 289, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n In the United States District Court, Southern District of Iowa, an indictment with three counts, filed December 2, 1924, charged Alston with violating section 1, Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, approved December 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 785, c. 1, as amended by Act February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1130, \n\n[274 U.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n 1131 (Comp. St.  6287g), by purchasing morphine and cocaine from unstamped packages. He pleaded 'guilty' and was sentenced to the penitentiary. A writ of error took the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, and it asked our instruction upon certain question. Thereupon we required the entire record to be sent here for final determination of the whole matter. Section 239, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216).\n Sections 1 and 6 of the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act were amended by the Act of February 24, 1919, and, as thus amended, were re-enacted without change by sections 1005 and 1006, Revenue Act approved November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 298, 300 (Comp. St.  6287g, 6287l). The amending act added the following provisions (among others) to section 1:\n'That there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid upon opium, coca leaves, any compound, salt, derivative, or preparation thereof, produced in or imported into the United States, and sold, or removed for consumption or sale, an internal-revenue tax at the rate of 1 cent per ounce, and any fraction of an ounce in a package shall be taxed as an ounce, such tax to be paid by the importer, manufacturer, producer, or compounder thereof, and to be represented by appropriate stamps, to be provided by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and the stamps herein provided shall be so affixed to the bottle or other container as to securely seal the stopper, covering, or wrapper thereof.\n\n'The tax imposed by this section shall be in addition to any import duty imposed on the aforesaid drugs.\n\n'It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute any of the aforesaid drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps from any of the aforesaid drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the \n\n[274 U.S. 289, 294]\n\u00a0\n person in whose possession same may be found; and the possession of any original stamped package containing any of the aforesaid drugs by any person who has not registered and paid special taxes as required by this section shall be prima facie evidence of liability to such special tax: Provided,' etc.\n\n Section 9 of the original Harrison Act (Comp. St.  6287o) has remained without change. It provides:\n'That any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the requirements of this act shall, on conviction, be fined not more than $ 2,000 or be imprisoned not more than five years, or both, in the discretion of the court.'\n\n The judgment of the trial court is assailed upon two grounds: That Congress has failed to prescribe any punishment for the purchase of drugs from unstamped packages, forbidden by amended section 1; and that the entire act, as amended, is invalid because Congress has undertaken thereby to regulate matters beyond its powers and within exclusive control of the states.\n Section 9, above quoted, obviously applies to the requirements of the amended act as well as to those found in the original. The first objection has no merit.\n The present cause arises under those provisions of section 1 which impose a stamp tax on certain drugs and declare it unlawful to purchase or sell them except in or from original stamped packages. These provisions are clearly within the power of Congress to lay taxes and have no necessary connection with any requirement of the act which may be subject to reasonable disputation. They do not absolutely prohibit buying or selling; have produced substantial revenue-contain nothing to indicate that by colorable use of taxation Congress is attempting to invade the reserved powers of the states. The impositions are not penalties.\n The judgment of the trial court must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN NATIONAL CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 167\nArgued: February 25, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 99, 100]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles H. Garnett and Streeter B. Flynn, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The receiver of the F. B. Collins Investment Company-proceeding under section 24, par. 20, of the Judicial Code1-brought this suit against the United States to recover an additional income and excess profits tax of $4, 287.64 that had been assessed against the Company for the year 1917 under the Revenue Act of 19162 and the War Revenue Act of 19173, and paid by it under protest. The District Court, sitting as a Court of Claims, on its findings of fact, entered judgment in favor of the United States, before the effective date of the Jurisdictional Act of 1925. And this direct appeal was allowed. J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 458\n, 39 S. Ct. 158.\n The question here presented is whether under the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916, the Company in computing its taxable net income for 1917 was entitled to deduct from its gross income the amount of certain obligations for the payment of money which it claimed were 'expenses' incurred in the operation of its business within that year.\n The Revenue Act of 1916 provided, in sections 12(a) and 13(a), that the net income of a corporation should be ascertained by deducting from its gross income received \n\n[274 U.S. 99, 101]\n\u00a0\n within the year, first, the 'ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business'; and, in section 13(d), that a corporation 'keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ... make its return upon the basis upon which its accounts are kept, in which case the tax shall be computed upon its income as so returned.' In Treasury Decision 2433,4 issued in January, 1917, dealing with the latter provision, the Commissioner ruled that:\n'Under this provision it will be permissible for corporations which accrue on their books monthly or at other stated periods amounts sufficient to meet fixed annual or other charges to deduct from their gross income the amounts so accrued, provided such accruals approximate as nearly as possible the actual liabilities for which the accruals are made, and provided that in cases wherein deductions are made on the accrual basis as hereinbefore indicated income from fixed and determinable sources accruing to the corporations must be returned, for the purpose of the tax, on the same basis. ... This ruling contemplates that the income and authorized deductions shall be computed and accounted for on the same basis and that the same practice shall be consistently followed year after year.'\n\n The findings of fact show that the Company, an Oklahoma corporation, had been engaged since 1908 in the business of making loans secured by mortgages upon real estate, which it negotiated and sold to investors. Under its usual course of business the borrower, upon the making of a loan, executed to the order of the Company his note for the amount loaned, due in five years, with interest at 5 per cent. per annum, payable semiannually; with the privilege of paying $100 or any multiple thereof on \n\n[274 U.S. 99, 102]\n\u00a0\n the principal, on or after two years, at the maturity of any interest payment. At the same time the borrower executed to the Company another note due in two years, without interest, for 10 per cent. of the total amount of the loan, as the Company's commission or compensation for making and negotiating the loan. From these commission notes the Company derived its income.\n At first the Company negotiated and sold the loan notes to investors entirely through brokers or agents, to whom it paid fees or commissions. But from and after 1916 it sold many of these notes direct to investors; and being thus relieved from payment of these fees or commissions, and as an inducement to investors to purchase from it direct, agreed to pay them bonuses upon the notes as added consideration for the purchases; this being evidenced by a contract, styled a Guarantee, which the Company gave the investor, agreeing to pay him during the life of the loan, according to the terms of the note, 1 per cent. per annum of its amount, in addition to the 5 per cent. per annum that the borrower was to pay.\n The Company consistently kept its books of account from year to year on an 'accrual basis.' Under the practice followed from the inception of its bonus method of doing business, whenever a loan note was sold it charged on its books, as an expense incurred in the sale, the aggregate amount of the payments called for in the bonus contract, computed at 1 per cent. per annum to the maturity of the note, and credited the investor on its books with a like amount, in a subsidiary bills payable ledger. The total amount of this liability on the bonus contracts was carried on its general ledger under a control account called the Guarantee Fund Account.\n In the year 1917, in accordance with this practice, the Company accrued and set up on its books as a liability and charged to expense, the aggregate amount of the payments called for in the bonus contracts given investors during \n\n[274 U.S. 99, 103]\n\u00a0\n that year. And it made its tax return for that year upon the basis upon which the accounts were kept, claiming as an expense the aggregate amount of these bonus contracts, as set up on its books. And, as admitted in argument, although not shown specifically by the findings of fact, it also entered on its books and returned as income received during the year, the aggregate amount of the commission notes given by the borrowers when it made the loans.\n Furthermore, under the Company's practice, if any loan note was paid by the borrower before maturity, the difference between the amount of the bonus contract credited to the investor's account and the payments that had been made on the contract, was credited back to Profit and Loss, and treated as income of the Company for the year in which the note was paid.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the claim of the Company for the deduction of the total amount of the bonus contracts issued in 1917, and allowed the deduction only to the extent of the installments called for by such contracts which matured in 1917; and in accordance with this ruling made the additional assessment which is here involved. And the sole question here is whether the Company was entitled to deduct the entire amount of the bonus contracts, as it claimed, or merely such portion thereof as became due within the year, as ruled by the Commissioner.\n The government, although conceding that the bonus contracts 'represented an expense' of the Company's business, contends that their total amount was not deductible as an expense 'incurred' in 1917, on the grounds that only a part of the obligations 'accrued' within that year, and that the method used by the Company in keeping its books did not clearly reflect its true income. We cannot sustain this contention.\n In United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 437\n, 46 S. Ct. 131, we held that where a corporation kept its books on an ac- \n\n[274 U.S. 99, 104]\n\u00a0\n crual basis, the amount of a reserve entered thereon for taxes imposed by the United States on the profits of munitions made and sold during the taxable year, should be deducted from its gross income for that year, although they were not assessed and did not become due until the following year. The Court said:\n'While section 12(a) taken by itself would appear to require the income tax return to be made on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, it is to be read with section 13(d) ... providing in substance that a corporation keeping its books on a basis other than receipts and disbursements, may make its return on that basis provided it is one which reflects income. ... Treasury Decision 2433 ... recognized the right of the corporation to deduct all accruals made on its books to meet liabilities, provided the return included income accrued and, as made, reflected true net income. ... A consideration of the difficulties involved in the preparation of an income account on a strict basis of receipts and disbursements ... indicates with no uncertainty the purpose of sections 12(a) and 13(d ) ... to enable taxpayers to keep their books and make their returns according to scientific accounting principles, by charging against income earned during the taxable period, the expenses incurred in and properly attributable to the process of earning income during that period; and indeed, to require the tax return to be made on that basis, if the taxpayer failed or was unable to make the return on a strict receipts and disbursements basis. ... The ( corporation's) true income ... could not have been determined without deducting from its gross income during the year the total costs and expenses attributable to the production of that income during the year. ... In the economic and bookkeeping sense with which the statute and Treasury Decision were concerned, the ( munitions) taxes had accrued. It should be noted that section 13(d) makes no use of the words 'accrue' or 'accrual' but merely provides for \n\n[274 U.S. 99, 105]\n\u00a0\n a return upon the basis upon which the taxpayer's accounts are kept, if it reflects income. ... We do not think that the Treasury Decision contemplated a return on any other basis when it used the terms 'accrued' and 'accrual' and provided for the deduction by the taxpayer of items 'accrued on their books.\"\n\n So, in the present case, we think that the amount of the bonus contracts was 'an expense incurred and properly attributable' to the Company's process of earning income during the year 1917. These contracts were not analogous to obligations to pay interest on money borrowed, but were expenses incurred in selling the loan notes in as real a sense as if under its original system of doing business the Company had paid these amounts to brokers as fees for selling the loans or given them notes for such fees. The Company's net income for the year could not have been rightly determined without deducting from the gross income represented by the commission notes, the obligations which it incurred under the bonus contracts, and would not have been accurately shown by keeping its books or making its return on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements. The method which it adopted clearly reflected the true income. And, just as the aggregate amount of the commission note was properly included in its gross income for the year-although not due and payable until the expiration of two years-so, under the doctrine of the Anderson Case, the total amount of the bonus contracts was deductible as an expense incurred within the year, although it did not 'accrue' in that year in the sense of becoming then due and payable.\n We conclude that the assessment of the additional tax, having been based upon an erroneous disallowance of the deduction claimed by the Company, was invalid; and that the receiver was entitled to recover the amount paid, with interest.\n The decree of the District Court is accordingly\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

Daugherty, of Frankfort, Ky., for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Without opinion the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment by the Harlan circuit court against petitioner and in favor of the commonwealth for the aggregate sum of 44 judgments against the Adams Express Company theretofore granted on account of alleged defaults during 1916\n\n\n The Adams Company is a 'joint-stock association,' organized under the laws of New York. For many years it operated as a common carrier of goods in Kentucky and other states and owned therein valuable property essential to the conduct of this business. In Kentucky it owned no other property.\n The petitioner is a Delaware corporation, organized under an agreement of the interested parties for the purpose of taking over the business and operating property \n\n[273 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n of all the principal express companies of the country by issuing stock to the several owners. Directly after its organization, and on July 1, 1918, it acquired the entire express business and all property connected therewith of the Adams Company and issued therefor several million dollars of its capital stock. (Like transfers were made by the other express companies.) The seller immediately ceased to operate in Kentucky and the purchaser continued the business. Neither company made any provision for paying the outstanding obligations of the Adams Company contradicted in Kentucky; but the latter held in its treasury at New York the stock received from the purchaser, possessed other valuable property located there, and was solvent.\n Respondent claimed that petitioner became liable for unsatisfied obligations of the Adams Company. After a full and fair hearing upon pleadings and proof, the Court of Appeals sustained this theory, but assigned no reason. That court, it is said, determined the same issues as here presented in American Railway Express Co. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 190 Ky. 636, 228 S. W. 433, 30 A. L. R. 543, and supported the judgment by an elaborate opinion. But the record now before us fails to show any reference whatever to that opinion when the present cause was decided.\n The petition for certiorari affirmed that the cause involved the following questions of constitutional law and because of them asked a review. We go no further than their consideration requires.\n\n\n (1)\n Whether it is a lack of due process of law for the Kentucky court to deprive the petitioner of its property on the following assumptions, which are unsupported by the record and contrary to fact: (a) That the Adams Express Company is a corporation; (b) that the state of Kentucky was a creditor of the Adams Express Company on June 30, 1918; (c) that the stock issued to the Adams Express Company was distributed by it among its shareholders. \n\n[273 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n (2) Whether petitioner is denied the equal protection of the laws by a decision of a state court which holds that a corporation which pays cash for property is a holder for value, but that a corporation which issues less than a controlling interest of its own stock for property is a donee, and takes such property subject to existing claims of the vendor's creditors.\n\n\n (3)\n Whether it is lack of due process for the state of Kentucky to enforce a rule that a bona fide purchaser for value of all the Kentucky property of a solvent vendor is liable to Kentucky creditors of the vendor to the extent of the value of the property acquired.\n\n\n (4)\n Whether a decision of a state court which is contrary to the common law, and justifiable only as an exercise of the state's police power, can be retroactively applied to affect vested rights.\n The grounds upon which the Court of Appeals rested its judgment are not revealed; there was no opinion. Consequently, petitioner's argument, which rests upon alleged assumptions, is impertinent.\n The record discloses no ruling that a corporation which pays cash for property holds for value, but if property is acquired by issuing less than a controlling interest of stock it takes subject to claims of the seller's creditors.\n As there was no controlling statute, the state court necessarily determined the rights and liabilities of the parties under the general rules of jurisprudence, which it deemed part of the law of Kentucky and applicable in the circumstances. It went no further. No earlier opinion was overruled or qualified, and no rule was given any retroactive effect. Save in exceptional circumstances, not now present, we must accept as controlling the decision of the state courts upon questions of local law, both statutory and common. 'The due process clause does not take up the laws of the several states, and make all questions pertaining to them constitutional questions, nor \n\n[273 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n does it enable this court to revise the decisions of the state courts upon questions of state law.' Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 165\n, 166 S., 37 S. Ct. 318, 321 (61 L. Ed. 644).\n The Kentucky court had jurisdiction and has determined only that under commonlaw principles, in the peculiar circumstances above narrated, where the facts were or might have been known to the purchasing corporation, it became liable for claims against the vendor resulting from transactions within the state. The action of the court followed a fair hearing, and there is no pretense that the challenged views were adopted in order to evade a constitutional issue. We cannot interfere, unless the judgment amounts to mere arbitrary or capricious exercise of power, or is in clear conflict with those fundamental 'principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights.' Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 733 (24 L. Ed. 565); Booth v. Illinois, \n184 \nU.S. 425, 429\n, 22 S. Ct. 425; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 329\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375.\n It is firmly established that a merely erroneous decision given by a state court in the regular course of judicial proceedings does not deprive the unsuccessful party of property without due process of law.

Ct. 772.\n Considering the circumstances disclosed by the record, there was nothing arbitrary or obviously contrary to the fundamental principles of justice in requiring the petitioner, organized for the purposes shown, to satisfy claims against the Adams Company which arose out of business within the state. The transfer of all the latter's property located in the state materially interfered with the ability of Kentucky creditors to enforce their claims, and, \n\n[273 U.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n as to them, might have been declared fraudulent. It seems clear that the state, without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, might have enacted through its legislative department a statute of precisely the same effect as the rule of law and public policy declared by the Court of Appeals, and its decision is just as valid as such a statute would have been.

The Southern Express Company owned no other property located in Virginia. After this transfer it retired from the state, but in New York continued to hold valuable assets, including the stock of petitioner so received, and was solvent. \n\n[273 U.S. 274, 279]\n\u00a0\n September 15, 1919, respondent sued the Southern Company in the Norfolk circuit court for the value of goods intrusted to it in 1917 for transportation from Richmond to Norfolk, Va., and lost. Summons was executed by delivering a copy to the chairman of the state Corporation Commission and transmitting another to the defendant by mail. A. special plea challenged the validity of the service upon the ground that the defendant had withdrawn from the state, and was no longer a foreign corporation doing business there, within the meaning of the Code provisions printed in the margin. \n1\n This special plea was overruled. Defendant failed to plead further, and judgment went by default May 15, 1920\n\n\n July, 1922, respondent here sued petitioner for the amount of the above-described judgment upon the theory \n\n[273 U.S. 274, 280]\n\u00a0\n that under the narrated circumstances the latter became liable for outstanding obligations of the Southern Company contracted in Virginia. After a full and fair hearing the trial court gave judgment therefor. The Special Court of Appeals affirmed this action. 141 Va. 602, 126 S.

Ed. -, decided this day, is enough to dispose of all material points raised here, except the claim that the judgment against the Southern Express Company was void, because not based on proper service of process; and that is without merit. Evidently the statute might reasonably be construed as intended to designate an agent upon whom process should be served in suits growing out of transactions within the state where the corporation had failed so to do. The state court gave the statute that effect, and we are bound by the result. Mutual Reserve Association v. Phelps, \n190 \nU.S. 147, 158\n, 23 S. Ct. 707; Hunter v.

St .  1215). The plaintiff below was the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad; the defendants, the Arkansas Railroad Commission and a state prosecuting attorney. The controversy concerns an order of the state commission, which suspends for examination an intrastate commodity tariff, framed on the mileage basis, which had been filed by the railroad to cover cottonseed and its products. A restraining order issued two days after the filing of the bill, in accordance with a stipulation of the parties. An interlocutory injunction was granted, after overruling a motion to dismiss the bill. The defendants then answered. The case was heard before three judges on final hearing, and evidence which occupies 174 pages of the printed record was introduced. The final decree sets aside the order of the state commission suspending the tariffs, and enjoins enforcement of that order.\n No opinion was delivered on entry of either the interlocutory or the final decree. and neither decree states the reasons for issuing the injunction. Failure to observe the requirement of section 19 of the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 738 (Code of Laws, tit. 28,  383, p. 909 (Comp. St.  1243c)), although improper, does not invalidate the decrees. Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. (No. 894) \n274 \nU.S. 588\n, 47 S. Ct. 720, 71 L. Ed. -, decided May 31, 1927. But we are of opinion that on the undisputed facts the decree appealed from should be reversed, with directions to dismiss the bill.\n The tariff filed by the railroad, which the Arkansas commission suspended, covers only intrastate rates. It corresponds with tariffs for interstate rates which the In- \n\n[274 U.S. 597, 599]\n\u00a0\n terstate Commerce Commission prescribed. The earlier intrastate tariff, for which it was a substitute, was lower. The railroad claims that the state commission should be enjoined, because the earlier tariff is unlawful, and that the suspended tariff, although applicable only to intrastate rates, is valid, under the doctrine of the Shreveport case. Houston East & West Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833. The railroad concedes that states have the exclusive right to fix intrastate rates, subject to the limitation that such rates must not unduly discriminate against interstate commerce; that a mere difference in rate does not constitute an undue discrimination; that the question whether discrimination exists is one for the Interstate Commerce Commission; that to justify federal interference there must be substantial disparity resulting in real discrimination; and that the extent of the alleged discrimination must be found in the federal commission's order. It contends that the Interstate Commerce Commission found that the existing intrastate class and commodity tariff discriminated unjustly against interstate commerce, that it ordered the removal of the discrimination, and that the railroad had, therefore, the right and the duty to substitute a new nondiscriminating tariff. The answer of the state commission is a denial that the federal commission made such finding or order.\n The issue presented must be determined by construing the reports and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The controversy had its origin in a general inquiry, arising out of alleged discrimination against Memphis through Arkansas and other intrastate rates, but extending to the entire rate schedule of the Southwest and between the Southwest and Mississippi river crossings-an investigation which has occupied much time of the federal commission. \n1\n The particular question here \n\n[274 U.S. 597, 600]\n\u00a0\n presented involves primarily only the reports and orders in two cases, Memphis-Southwestern Investigation-Commodity Rates, 77 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 473 and Oklahoma Commission v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., 98 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 183. In the former case a standard distance scale of rates on commodities, including those on cottonseed and its products, was prescribed or approved (i) interstate from the river crossings to points in Arkansas, Southern Missouri, and Western Louisiana; (ii) interstate between points in Arkansas, Southern Missouri, and Western Louisiana; and ( iii) the same scale was virtually prescribed intrastate in Arkansas by a finding that, to avoid discrimination, the rates from Memphis and Natchez to Arkansas should not exceed, for equal distances, the Arkansas intrastate rates. \n2\n There was an express finding that the Arkansas intrastate rates were discriminatory and an order that the discrimination should \n\n[274 U.S. 597, 601]\n\u00a0\n be removed. Thereupon the intrastate rates were changed, in conformity with the order, and those in force at the time of the institution of this suit were filed, to become effective as of November 27, 1923. Ultimately they had the approval of the state commission. The findings and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission in that case (77 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 473) were made without prejudice to any orders which might be made in the Oklahoma Commission Case or in others then pending.\n In the Oklahoma Commission Case, 98 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 183, attack was made upon the interstate rates on cottonseed and its products, not only upon those in the territory involved in the Memphis-Southwestern Case, but also upon those in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico, and upon those from such points to Western Classification territory. The intrastate rates of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Western Louisiana, and Southern Missouri were also attacked. The report prescribed an interstate distance scale on such products throughout most of the territory involved, an between such territory and the Mississippi river crossings (East St. Louis and South), the scale being somewhat higher than the Memphis- Southwestern scale. The Texas and Oklahoma intrastate rates were found prejudicial to interstate commerce to the extent to which they were lower than the interstate rates, for like distances, in force in those states. But the Interstate Commerce Commission made no finding or order with reference to the Arkansas intrastate rates, saying:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 597, 602]\n\u00a0\n 'The evidence of record upon which a conclusion may be reached as to the discriminatory character of the intrastate rates on cottonseed and cottonseed cake, meal, and hulls now in effect in Arkansas and on all of these commodities applying between points in Louisiana is very meager. ... We are not informed as to the routes over which the Arkansas intrastate rates apply, and particular instances of discrimination in the present rates are absent.'\n The railroad concedes that intrastate Arkansas rates are not within the terms of the order of the federal commission in the Oklahoma Commission Case. Its argument is that in the Memphis-Southwestern Cast it was ordered that the Memphis to Arkansas rates should not exceed the Arkansas intrastate rates, that that order has not been rescinded, and hence that, when the interstate rate from Memphis to Arkansas was raised as a result of the Oklahoma Commission Case, it became the duty of the railroads to raise the intrastate rates to a corresponding degree. But it appears that in the later case the Interstate Commerce Commission considered the propriety of ordering the Arkansas intrastate rates raised to the new level, and refused to do so. There was no rescission in terms of the former order. But when the two orders are read together, as they must be, it is clear that the Commission construed its earlier order as requiring only that the Arkansas rates should not be lower than the interstate Memphis to Arkansas rates prescribed in that case, as long as they should be maintained. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 597, 603]\n\u00a0\n The intention to interfere with the state function of regulating intrastate rates is not to be presumed. Where there is a serious doubt whether an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission extends to intrastate rates, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the state power. If, as the railroad believed, the federal commission intended to include the intrastate Arkansas rates within its order, it should have taken action, through appropriate application, to remove the doubt by securing an expression by that commission of the intention so to do. Compare American Express Co. v. South Dakota, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 627\n, 37 S. Ct. 656; Illinois Cent. R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 509\n, 510 S., 38 S.

Co., supra, we called attention to the importance to the parties, to the public, and to this court of supporting the decree, in cases of this character, by an opinion which shall state fully the reasons for setting aside a commissioner's order.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The controversy began with complaints, filed by Memphis and Natchez interests, alleging that the rates from Memphis and Natchez to Arkansas were prejudicial as compared with Arkansas intrastate rates, and with the rates from other Mississippi river crossings to Arkansas. See Memphis Freight Bureau v. St. L., I. M. & S. Ry. Co., 36 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 224; City of Memphis v. C., R. I. & P. Ry. Co., 39 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 256, Id., 43 Interst. Com.

Efforts to obey orders made in those cases revealed that it was difficult to deal with the rates there involved except as part of a general adjustment of rates in the Southwest. Accordingly those cases were reopened for consideration in a general investigation. The first report of the general investigation established a distance scale of maximum interstate class rates between points in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Southern Missouri, and between certain river crossings and such points. Memphis- Southwestern Investigation, 55 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 515. It virtually prescribed the same scale of class rates intrastate in Arkansas by finding that the intrastate rates should not be less, for equal distances, than the interstate rates from Memphis and Natchez to Arkansas. In Extension of Memphis-Southwestern Scale, 62 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 596, the same scale of class rates was approved for extension to Texas points. All these cases dealt with class rates only; the reports referred to in the text deal with commodity rates only. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Throughout the opinion no mention is made of charges for the ferry and bridge crossings of the Mississippi. All the distance scales prescribed by the Commission make provision for added charges for such crossings, and the discrimination orders against the intrastate rates make allowance for such charges.\n The Memphis-Southwestern distance scale was later put into effect voluntarily intrastate in Louisiana. And it was approved for application from Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Western Louisiana to Fort Worth. Fort Worth Cotton Oil Mill v. A., T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 80 Interst. Com.

St.  994), to enjoin and annual an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The order, which was to become effective March 1, 1925, prescribes for all railroads subject to its jurisdiction a so-called 'assigned car rule' governing the distribution of cars among bituminous coal mines in times of car shortage. Assigned Cars for Bituminous Coal Mines, 80 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 520; Id., 93 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 701. Some of the plaintiffs are operators of coal mines, some distributors of coal, some large private consumers of coal, and some are railroads. All had been parties to the proceeding before the Commission in which the order was entered. The defendants in each case are the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and various intervening mine operators. All the defendants answered. The cases were heard together on the evidence before three judges. A final decree granting the relief prayed for was entered in each case on December 15, 1925. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. v. United States (D. C.) 9 F. (2d) 429. The cases are here on appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St.  1215).1 They were argued together. \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 568]\n\u00a0\n The term 'assigned cars' is used in contradistinction to system cars. By assigned cars are meant those placed for use at a specified mine for a particular shipper. By system cars are meant those, from time to time on the line, which are being kept available for use at any mine for any shipper. Assigned cars are of two classes. One class of assigned cars consists of private cars. These are cars owned (or leased) by some shipper ( or subject to the control of a particular person not a rail carrier) who delivers them to the railroad for placement at designated mines for loading and transportation as desired by the owner of the cars. Assigned cars of the other class are called railroad fuel cars. These consist wholly of cars owned (or leased) by some carrier, which, instead of being left, like system cars for use indiscriminately in carrying coal from any mine for any consignor to any consignee, are assigned to a particular mine to carry coal to be used as fuel by a particular carrier.\n Four of the suits were brought by private car owners. They illustrate different conditions under which, or different purposes for which, private cars are so used. The plaintiffs in No. 709 are coal merchants, who operate mines. The plaintiffs in No. 710 are integrated concerns, which operate mines solely in order to supply coal to their manufacturing plants. The plaintiffs in No. 711 are by-product coke concerns, which do not operate any mine. The plaintiff in No. 712 is a public utility, which does not operate any mine. In each of these four cases, the cars owned were acquired by the shipper, and are used, solely in order to assure transportation of an indispensable supply of coal. The number of coal cars used on the railroads of the United States is estimated as between \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 569]\n\u00a0\n 900,000, and 950,000. Of these about 29,000 are private cars.\n The fifth suit, No. 606, is brought by owners of railroad fuel cars. The plaintiffs in it are 35 railroads, including many of the leading bituminous coal carriers of the United States and representing each of the several classes of railroad fuel car owners. Railroad fuel cars are divided, according to ownership, into foreign fuel cars, that is, those which belong to, and are used for the fuel supply of, a carrier other than the one on whose lines the mine is located, and home line or system fuel cars, that is, those which are owned by, and are used to supply fuel to, the carrier on whose lines the mine is located. Railroad fuel cars are further classified according to the ownership, use, and character of the mine to which they are assigned; that is, whether the cars are used wholly in connection with a mine owned by the carrier which owns the cars, whether they are used in connection with a mine not owned by such carrier, but whose whole output is contracted for by it, or whether the mine at which the cars are to be placed is a 'commercial' one-that is, a mine which supplies coal also to the general public. About 28 per cent. of all bituminous coal mined is consumed by railroads. The number of the railroads to which the prescribed rule applies is 3,073. Of these, all except the 35 plaintiffs in No. 606 have acquiesced in the order.\n The subject of discrimination in the distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage has occupied much of the time of the Commission ever since its establishment. \n2\n Some general investigations of the matter were under taken \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 570]\n\u00a0\n by it pursuant to resolutions of Congress. \n3\n Many specific inquiries were made in passing upon complaints of individual shippers who charged unjust discrimination by individual carriers. \n4\n In two of these cases, Railroad Commission v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., 12 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 398, and Traer v. Chicago & Alton R. R. Co., 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 451, a rule of practice was prescribed for individual carriers, in 1907 and 1908, which was approved by this court upon review in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452\n, 30 S. Ct. 155. That practice, which became known as the Hocking Valley-Traer rule, \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 571]\n\u00a0\n was later adopted, either voluntarily or pursuant to orders of the Commission, by other carriers. \n5\n So far as concerned private cars, the rule was, in substance, adopted, during federal control, by the Railroad Administration. Car Service Circular 31-effective October 10, 1918; revised December 23, 1919. Upon the termination of federal control, the Commission issued a notice to carriers and shippers (dated March 2, 1920) recommending 'that until experience and careful study demonstrated that other rules would be more effective and beneficial,' the uniform rule contained in that circular should be continued in effect. Later (April 15, 1920) it recommended that the Hocking Valley-Traer rule be applied by the carriers also to railroad fuel cars. \n6\n But no uniform rule \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 572]\n\u00a0\n concerning assigned cars applicable to all carriers had been prescribed by the Commission until the entry of the order here complained of; and much diversity in practice existed. Many of the railroads had secured their coal during periods of car shortage without resort to the use of assigned cars; and one, at least, of the leading bituminous coal carriers of the United States declines to permit the use of any assigned cars on its lines.\n The rule here assailed was the fruit of an investigation commenced by the Commission of its own motion, in March, 1921, with a view to prescribing just and reasonable rules applicable to all carriers concerning the use of assigned cars for bituminous coal. Every carrier subject to its jurisdiction was made a respondent. Private coal car owners, coal mine operators, coal miners, coal distributors and large coal consumers became parties by intervention. The evidence introduced occupied nearly 6,000 pages. The investigation extended over four years. The reports of the Commission on the original hearing and the rehearing occupy 117 pages of the record. It concluded that the practices expressed in the Hocking Valley-Traer rule, and other existing regulations of carriers, resulted in unjust discrimination and were unreasonable. It ordered that the carriers cease and desist from such practices. And it prescribed the uniform rule which prohibits any carrier from placing for loading at any mine more than that mine's ratable share of all cars, including assigned cars, available for use in the district; unless the carrier is permitted to place more by an emergency order issued by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (15) of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 402 of the Transportation Act February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 477 (Comp. St.  8563). This rule requires that in determining how many cars are available in the district, the carrier placing the cars shall count all cars; that is, it must include with those owned by it, all owned by foreign railroads and \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 573]\n\u00a0\n assigned for their fuel service and likewise all owned by private shippers and assigned for their service. Thus, the prohibition embodied in the rule applies to all carriers, whatever the character of the consignor or consignee, and whatever the use to which the coal is to be put.\n The operation of the uniform rule may be illustrated by the following example: Assume that there are in the district 10 mines each with the rating, or capacity, of 20 cars a day; that of the 200 cars needed to fill the district's requirement only 100 cars are available on a particular day; and that of the 100, only 85 are owned by the railroad, the remaining 15 being owned by mine A. Under the rule, the share of each mine would be 10 cars. Mine A would be permitted to have placed its own cars, buy only 10 of them. If, on the other hand, 95 of the 100 cars had been owned by the carrier, and only 5 by mine A, there would be placed at its mine, in addition to its own 5 cars, 5 of the carrier's so-called system cars. The rule does not divert the surplus of cars owned by one shipper to use by another. It merely puts a restriction upon the use of the private car by limiting the number of the so-called assigned cars which may be placed at a particular mine at a particular time. The owner may use the surplus elsewhere, or he may lease the surplus cars to the carrier or to another shipper. The operation of the rule upon assigned railroad fuel cars is precisely similar. The limitation is imposed in order to improve the service and to prevent any mine (including one operated by a railroad) from securing, at the particular time, more than its ratable share of the aggregate available coal transportation facilities.\n The order here assailed differs from the Hocking Valley-Traer rule approved in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., supra, in two respects. Under the Hocking Valley-Traer rule the carrier was permitted to place at a mine all the cars (whether private or railway fuel cars) which had been assigned to it, even \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 574]\n\u00a0\n if the number assigned exceeded its pro rata of all available cars. The prohibition formerly imposed was merely upon placing at a mine any system cars, if it had its full quota from assigned cars. Under the rule here assailed, the carrier is prohibited from placing at a mine more cars than its pro rata, even if all sought to be placed are assigned private cars or railway fuel cars. Moreover, the rule here assailed is a uniform rule governing all carriers without regard to their particular circumstances, whereas the Hocking Valley-Traer Cases prescribed a practice for the individual carrier after it had been found, upon specific inquiry, that the carrier had been guilty of undue discrimination. Thus, the earlier orders were in their nature largely judicial. The order here attacked is wholly legislative.\n No question is here involved concerning those rules, regulations or practices of the carriers by which the ratings of the several mines are determined. See In re Rules Governing Ratings of Coal Mines, etc., 95 Interst. Com Com'n R. 309. No question is raised concerning the limits of the districts into which the carriers' lines are divided for the purpose of applying the rule. No question is raised concerning the adequacy of the supply of system cars. See Car Shortage, etc., 12 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 561; Car Supply Investigation, 42 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 657. Nor is any question presented here concerning the compensation of, or allowance to, private car owners for the use of their cars in performing the transportation under the tariffs. See Matter of Private Cars, 50 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 652. There was confessedly no irregularity in the method of proceeding pursued by the Commission. There is a faint contention that the only remedy for violation of the rule is prosecution for the penalty provided by the statute, and that the Commission exceeded its authority in enjoining the placing. The contention is clearly groundless. The order is in a form which, in other connections, has been approved by this \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 575]\n\u00a0\n court. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612\n, 31 S. Ct. 621; United States v. Union 57 L. Ed. 226; Pipe Line Cases, \n234 U.S. 57\n L. Ed. 226 Pipe Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 548, 561\n, 34 S. Ct. 956. The sole question requiring consideration is the validity of the requirement that, unless permission is given by the Commission, carriers shall, in placing assigned cars, be limited to the mine's quota, although the number of cars assigned to it exceeds the quota.\n The order is challenged on several grounds. All of the plaintiffs insist that in prescribing a universal rule the Commission has exceeded the powers conferred by Congress. All of the plaintiffs appear to attack the rule also on the ground that it is inherently unreasonable. Some insist that the order is unsupported by the findings and the evidence. Some that the rule involves a taking of property without due process of law. The private car owners urge specifically that the rule is an arbitrary interference with the use of their own property. The railroads urge especially that the rule is an illegal interference with their right to manage their own affairs.\n First. There is clearly no constitutional obstacle. The rule prescribed does not involve a taking of the property of the private car owner. Congress could exclude private cars from interstate railroads. Compare United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 405\n, 406 S., 411, 415, 29 S. Ct. 527. And it may prescribe conditions on which alone they may be used. See Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S. Ct. 761; Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 281\n, 37 S. Ct. 287. Limiting their use does not involve regulation of the coal mining industry. Likewise, Congress may prescribe how carrier-owned cars shall be used. The regulation prescribed does not invade the private business affairs of the carrier. It merely limits the use of certain interstate transportation facilities.\n Second. The main question for decision is one of statutory construction. It is whether Congress has vested in \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 576]\n\u00a0\n the Commission authority to prohibit a use of assigned cars by a general rule, which in its judgment is necessary to prevent unjust discrimination among mines or shippers and to provide reasonable service. The legislation to be construed is paragraphs 10 to 17, added to section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act by section 402 of Transportation Act, 1920, February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 476. The paragraphs more directly involved are:\n'(12) It shall also be the duty of every carrier by railroad to make just and reasonable distribution of cars for transportation of coal among the coal mines served by it, whether located upon its line or lines or customarily dependent upon it for car supply. During any period when the supply of cars available for such service does not equal the requirements of such mines it shall be the duty of the carrier to maintain and apply just and reasonable ratings of such mines and to count each and every car furnished to or used by any such mine for transportation of coal against the mine. Failure or fefusal so to do shall be unlawful, and in respect of each car not so counted shall be deemed a separate offense, and the carrier, receiver, or operating trustee so failing or refusing shall forfeit to the United States the sum of $100 for each offense, which may be recovered in a civil action brought by the United States. ...\n\n'(14) The Commission may, after hearing, on a complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, establish reasonable rules, regulations, and practices with respect to car service by carriers by railroad subject to this act. ...'\n\n Three widely divergent constructions of paragraph (12) are urged. The railroads contend that it prescribes a rule of distribution complete in itself; that the rule there prescribed is the Hocking Valley-Traer rule; and that the provision neither requires nor permits action by the Commission supplementary thereto. In support of this view \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 577]\n\u00a0\n the congressional history of the provision is particularly relied upon. The United States contends also that paragraph (12) prescribes a complete rule of car distribution; but its insistence is that the statute abolished the Hocking Valley-Traer rule and substituted for it a rule identical with that ordered by the Commission. Support for its view is sought particularly in the penalty provision of paragraph (12), in the provision of paragraph (10) which defines car service, and in paragraph (11) which prohibits any unjust and unreasonable practice in respect to car service. The Commission contends that paragraph (12) does not prescribe a complete rule; that it does not require either pro rata distribution of cars or distribution according to the Hocking Valley-Traer rule; that it requires merely that all cars be counted as the basis for determining the pro rata share of each mine; and that it leaves to the Commission administrative discretion to determine how the cars shall be distributed. The Commission's contention is, in our opinion, the sound one. It gives effect to the command that all cars shall be counted; and it leaves full scope both to the duty imposed upon the carriers in paragraph (11), and to the authority conferred upon the Commission in paragraph (14), to establish reasonable rules with respect to car service. This construction is consistent also with the legislative history of the provision, including the action of the conference committee by which the differences between the Senate and House bills were reconciled. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 564, 578]\n\u00a0\n One other question of statutory construction is urged by the railroads. They deny the authority of the Commission to deal with the distribution of railroad fuel cars. They point to paragraph 10 of section 1, which defines 'car service' as including the distribution of cars 'used in the transportation of property.' The contention is that because of the phrase quoted, the Commission's authority to make reasonable regulations with respect to car service, conferred by paragraph (14), is limited to the supervision of the performance by railroads of their common carrier duties of transportation for the public, and does not extend to supervision of their activity in securing fuel for use by the carrier. The contention is, in our opinion, groundless. So far as concerns foreign railroad fuel cars, the owner is obviously in the same position as a private shipper. \n8\n Carrying coal by a railroad for its own use as fuel is likewise transportation. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Ill. Cent. R. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 474\n, 30 S. Ct. 155. It would require very explicit language to convince us that Congress intended to permit discrimination if effected by the use of railroad fuel cars. Moreover, the phrase in question appears also in paragraph (12), which provides that the carrier must count against the mine all cars used 'for transportation of coal.'\n Third. It is contended that the rule prescribed is void because unreasonable. Most of the evidence and much of the briefs and arguments were directed to showing the hardships, waste and losses which would result from the prescribed restriction on the use of assigned cars. Private car owners urge that assigned car mines will be com- \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 579]\n\u00a0\n pelled to reduce loadings to conform to the average of system car mines; that private coal cars, representing large investment and sorely needed by their owners, will stand idle on the tracks; that steel industries will be partially or completely shut down and thousands of steel workers will be thrown out of employment; that coke and by-product companies will be partially or completely shut down and their employees temporarily deprived of their means of livelihood; that public utility companies will be compelled to resort to the unsatisfactory and uneconomic spot market for coal; that the supply of gas and electricity to the public will be seriously curtailed; that coal burning steamships will be delayed in sailing; and that the further development and expansion of the important by-product coke process will cease. The railroads urge that the prescribed rule will deprive them of the only effective means of procuring at all times, in dependable volume, suitable coal essential to their operation; that it will increase the cost of coal to them by preventing their running at full capacity the mines owned by them or those whose product they contract for; that it will increase the cost of operation also by depriving them of coal of uniform and approved quality; that in times of greatest car shortage it will involve the nonuse by them of a larger number of unused private cars; and that it will otherwise prevent efficient transportation service.\n There was much evidence that the practice which had been sanctioned in the Hocking Valley-Traer Cases did not operate satisfactorily. The Commission concluded that it was 'not the fruition of ripe experience.' Compare Hillsdale Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 19 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 356, 387. The effort to formulate a rule which would prevent discrimination was resumed. The Commission found that the existing assigned car practice reduces to a certain extent the supply of cars furnished to commercial mines; that the larger and steadier supply of \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 580]\n\u00a0\n cars gives the assigned car mines a great advantage in steadiness of operation, and hence in cost of production, in the selling markets, and in the labor market; and that, apart from the discrimination inherent in the assigned car rule, the carriers have been guilty of other willful discriminatory practices, which, as a practical matter, it would be difficult to prevent as long as the rule prevailed. It found also that the use of private cars tends more and more to produce inequalities in the use of other facilities, such as locomotives, tracks, and terminals; and that many, at least, of the so-called car shortages have been due not to an absence of cars but to an inability to move them; i. e., to a shortage of such other facilities. It found, also, that the railroads could, by various devices, obviate most of the difficulty in securing fuel, which they anticipated would result from the order here attacked.\n The argument most strongly urged is that, because the rule prescribes absolute uniformity, regardless of the necessities of the railroad or other consumer, regardless of the ownership of the mine or the cars, regardless of the character of the business done by the mine or its customer, it is necessarily unreasonable, and, hence, that the order is void. But the authority to establish reasonable rules conferred by paragraph (14) includes power to prescribe a rule of universal application. There was ample evidence to support the Commission's findings. It is not for courts to weigh the evidence introduced before the Commission, Western Paper Makers' Chemical Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 46 S. Ct. 500; or to inquire into the soundness of the reasoning by which its conclusions are reached, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 471\n, 30 S. Ct. 155; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 39 S. Ct. 375; or to question the wisdom of regulations which it prescribes, United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533, 542\n, 44 S. Ct. 610. \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 581]\n\u00a0\n These are matters left by Congress to the administrative 'tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Ct. 700, 704 (51 L. Ed. 1128).\n We cannot say that it was arbitrary and unreasonable for the Commission to conclude that good service could be secured by a uniform rule which might be departed from with its consent and that unjust discrimination could not be prevented without such a uniform rule. It acted in the light of a rich experience. It had learned by experience that the existing practices resulted in discrimination and unsatisfactory service. It had learned, also through experience, that the emergency powers conferred by the Transportation Act 1920, afforded adequate means of supplying the needs, and of averting the possible hardships and losses, of carriers and of private coal consumers, to which the evidence and arguments had been largely directed. \n9\n For the Commission had had much experience in applying these emergency powers in connection with the distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage, before it prescribed the rule here challenged. \n10\n Moreover, so \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 582]\n\u00a0\n far as concerns railroad fuel cars, the operation of the rule as modified from time to time by emergency orders would resemble the practice of the Car Service Section of the Railroad Administration during federal control. \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. The contention that findings of the Commission concerning discrimination were unsupported by evidence, or that findings essential to the order are lacking, rests largely upon a misconception. This objection was directed particularly to the finding that the existing prac- \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 583]\n\u00a0\n tice in regard to assigned cars results in giving to the mines enjoying assigned cars an unjust and unreasonable share of railroad services and of facilities other than cars. The claim is that the evidence, upon which the finding of the resulting discrimination in these other transportation facilities rests, relates to only a few carriers, and that the general finding to that effect is without support, because the evidence introduced was not shown to be typical. Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 196\n, 197 S., 43 S. Ct. 270; United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 291\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. The argument overlooks the difference in the character between a general rule prescribed under paragraph (12) and a practice for particular carriers ordered or prohibited under sections 1, 3, and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563, 8565, 8583). In the cases cited, the Commission was determining the relative rights of the several carriers in a joint rate. It was making a partition; and it performed a function quasi- judicial in its nature. In the case at bar, the function exercised by the Commission is wholly legislative. Its authority to legislate is limited to establishing a reasonable rule. But in establishing a rule of general application, it is not a condition of its validity that there be adduced evidence of its appropriateness in respect to every railroad to which it will be applicable. In this connection, the Commission, like other legislators, may reason from the particular to the general.\n Fifth. Equally unfounded is the contention that, under the guise of regulating carrier instrumentalities, the Commission is seeking to equalize industrial fortune and opportunity. The object of the rule was not to equalize fortunes, but to prevent an unjust discrimination in the use of transportation facilities and to improve the service. In essence, the power exerted is the same as that sustained in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452\n, 30 S. Ct. 155, where it was held that \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 584]\n\u00a0\n the Commission had power to prohibit the use of any system car, if the private cars assigned to the mine equaled its quota. The fact that Congress has permitted the use of private cars, and that the shippers' acquisition of them proceeds from the motive of self-interest which is recognized as legitimate, cannot prevent the Commission from prohibiting a use of the equipment in a way which it concludes will probably result in unjust discrimination against others and may prove detrimental otherwise to the transportation service. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 523\n, 524 S.. 44 S. Ct. 189; Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, No. 281, \n272 \nU.S. 658\n, 47 S. Ct. 222, decided December 13, 1926. The contention is admittedly baseless if, as we have concluded, there is evidence to support the finding that the assigned car practice causes discrimination in the use of other transportation facilities. For the appellees concede that the possession of private cars confers upon them no superior claim to other services.\n The order challenged is valid. The bills must be dismissed. The decress are reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n A temperate and dependable statement concerning the scope and effect of the order here challenged, taken from the brief of counsel for appellees, is printed in the margin. \n12\n And see the carefully prepared opinion of the \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 585]\n\u00a0\n court below. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. et al. v. United States (D. C.) 9 F.(2d) 429.\n To me it seems plain enough that the real purpose of the order was not rationally to control distribution of \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 586]\n\u00a0\n cars during times of shortage, but to force railroads and other large consumers to apportion their purchases of coal among a larger number of producers and thus advantage mines from which such consumers preferred not to buy. Both carrier and large manufacturer must have steady supplies of suitable coal, and it may be highly important to obtain these from one or a few approved mines. But if such mines are to be denied fuel and private cars during times of shortage, then for their reasonable protection \n\n[274 U.S. 564, 587]\n\u00a0\n these great consumers probably will endeavor to scatter their orders.\n The railroads of this country are private property. They must be operated by their owners according to law under supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission; but that body is not intrusted with their management and ought not to be permitted to assume it under any guise. In practice, carriers must use many cars daily for gathering fuel necessary for their operations, and I know of no authority possessed by the Commission to prevent them from purchasing this where and as their managers think best. To permit such interference under the mere guise of a rule for distribution of cars seems to me altogether wrong.\n Upon this record we must assume that the carriers have met their obligation to provide an adequate number of system cars.\n The practice of hiring and using private cars by railroad has been recognized and accepted by both Congress and the Commission. It has enlarged the total number of cars available for use and thereby aided all shippers. Those who provide private cars take nothing from any other shipper, but heretofore have secured the use of such cars for themselves although, because of temporary shortage, the system cars were insufficient to meet the demands of others.\n If the order was intended to enlarge the total supply of cars of bring about more equitable distribution of available cars in times of shortage, it was foolish. Supply cannot be increased, nor equitable distribution enforced, by prohibiting the use of private or fuel cars when most needed-requiring them to stand idle, on the sidings. If, on the other hand, as I must think, the real purpose was to force large consumers of scatter their purchases, the order goes beyond any power intrusted to the Commission.\n The decree below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In each suit the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, on the one hand, and the intervening defendants, on the other, took separate appeals, which were given separate docket numbers in this court.

This division was abolished by the termination of federal control. Confusion resulted. The amendment of the Commission's recommendation made on April 15, 1920, was that rule 8 of Circular 31 should read: 'Private cars and cars placed for railroad fuel loading in accordance with the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission in R. R. Com. of Ohio et al. v. H. V. Ry. Co., 12 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 398, and Traer v. Chicago & Alton Railroad Co. et al., 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 451, will be designated as 'assigned' cars. All other cars will be designated as 'unassigned' cars.'\n On September 28, 1920, the Commission issued its Service Order No. 18, effective October 1, renewing its recommendation of April 15, 1920, with the proviso: 'That common carriers by railraod may not assign cars for their own fuel and fail to count such cars against the mine's distributive share unless the entire output of such mine is taken by such carrier for a period of not less than six consecutive months.' This order was canceled March 24, 1921, at the time of the commencement of the investigation here involved. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The conference committee, House Report No. 650, 66th Cong. 2d Sess. p. 61, rejected section 34 of the Senate amendment which provided: 'That each and every car furnished or used for the transportation of coal during a car shortage period shall be counted against the proportionate distributive share of the mine receiving or using it and that no car shall be furnished to or used by any mine for the transportation of coal during a car shortage period in excess of the proportionate distributive share of such mine regardless in either case of who the consignor or consignors, or the consignee or consignees, or the owner or owners of the coal loaded or to be loaded into such cars may be, or the purpose for which such coal may be used or intended, or the ownership of such car or cars. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Compare Rates on Railroad Fuel, 36 Interst.

In some cases the emergency order applied to many carriers and many mining districts; in others to only a single carrier or a single district. In some cases the order applied only to shipments to a particular destination or for a particular purpose or by a particular route; in others the order was not so restried. In some cases the order the shipments until further notice; in some the period was fixed. In some cases there were suspensions. In some cases the order was limited to shipments of a specified amount of coal to a particular consignee. In some cases the order was limited to cars of a particular description. In some the amount to be shipped by each of several carriers was limited. In some the order applied only to mines of a particular character. In some the limitation depended upon the particular conditions existing at the mines.

S. 31, September 12, 1918, revised December 23, 1919. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Privately owned coal cars and cars furnished for railroad fuel coal, are collectively known technically as 'assigned cars'; this by reason of the fact that they are assigned by the owner of the car (whether a railroad company obtaining coal for fuel, or a shipper owning cars used for the transportation of its coal) for loading at mines, either owned by the owner of the car or with which it has contracts for coal. Coal cars of railroad ownership, other than those assigned to the loading of railroad fuel coal, are known and will be referred to as 'system cars.' \n Car distribution rules assume importance only in times of car shortage; that is to say, when car orders exceed car supply. To provide for such periods the capacity of such mine is rated in cars per day. A mine may order cars each day up to but not exceeding its rated capacity and in time of a car shortage generally does so (even though it might not actually have equivalent orders for coal) in order that it may get as many cars as possible.\n Under the practice now prevailing, but condemned by the Commission, all private cars (to the use of which system car mines have no right-that right being conceded to be exclusively in the owner of the car), and railway fuel cars are placed at the mine to which assigned even though such mine thereby receives cars to a greater extent of its rated mine capacity than is true of mines not having assigned cars. If such cars equal or exceed the pro rata of mine capacity to all cars on hand, such mines receive no system cars. It is only when such cars are less than such pro rata that such mines share in the distribution of system cars, and then only in such numbers as bring its cars up to such pro rata. The distribution of system cars to system mines is of course based on the pro rata available. The effect of the Commission's order is to forbid a mine to have the use of any private cars or railway fuel cars in excess of the same proportion or pro rata of rated mine capacity to which mines not having assigned cars are able to receive cars.\n In respect of railway fuel cars, the effect of the order under view is to prohibit the placement of such cars, in times of car shortage, at any mine owned by the railway company, or with which it has contracts for coal in sufficient numbers to load the output of such mines (or the proportion thereof taken by the railroad company for fuel purposes), provided the cars required for this purpose exceed the pro rata allotment of system cars, of which there is a shortage, at mines at which the company does not obtain fuel, and which, for the loading of their output, are dependent upon system cars.\n In respect of private cars, the order prohibits any railroad, where there is a shortage of system cars, from placing private coal cars at any mine of the owner of such cars (or with which it has contracts for coal) in excess of the number of system cars placed on the same \n day at a mine of similar capacity, which is dependent upon system cars for its supply. The order applies irrespective of the number of such private cars available for placement and loading. It applies when the carrier has motive power and other facilities sufficient to move all available cars, both system and private, as well as when it has not.\n The order is universal in its application and admits of no exception for any cause. It runs against every railroad in the United States, although as to the conditions on many, including many coalloading roads, there was no evidence.\n Each of the appellees had found by experience that it could not rely on the coal equipment of the railroads to provide the daily supply of suitable coal necessary for its operation in times of periodic and recurring coal car shortages, which shortages were due largely to the sudden expansion of orders for cars on the part of high cost mines which operated irregularly and principally only in times when the coal business was exceptionally active. Each, therefore, became a private car owner to protect its coal supply at such times. The mileage allowances made for the use of such cars by the railroad are insufficient to pay for their upkeep. The only advantage in their ownership lies in their use in times of car shortage. The order thus deprives the respondents and other owners of private cars of all beneficial use thereof. ...\n The order does not require the resulting surplus or private cars to be appropriated for general use, and the Commission's report distinctly disclaims any power so to do. Unless the owner consents to such appropriation, however, cars which he owns and needs, and which he bought as a protection against system car shortages, must stand idle, even though the railroad company is able and willing to place and move such cars and all system cars available for loading as well. \n\n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R.

Ct. 535\n\n\n It would be straining the language of the Act somewhat to say in any case that a wilful homicide 'resulted' from the failure of some superior officer to foresee the danger and to prevent it. In this case at all events we are of opinion that there was no evidence that warrants such a judgment. It is not necessary to state the facts in detail. Those mainly relied upon are that Fonvielle, the general yardmaster, knew that Southwell, the man who was killed, on previous occasions had used threatening language to Dallas, who shot Southwell; that Fonvielle knew or ought to have known that they were likely to meet when they did; that Fonvielle was with Dallas, his subordinate, just before that moment and that Dallas said to him 'Cap. all I want to do is to ask Southwell to lay off of me and let me alone,' and that Fonvielle said that he must not see Southwell, that if he saw him and talked to him it might bring about unpleasant consequences; that Fonvielle left Dallas and after having gone a short distance saw him and Southwell approaching each other and had taken a few steps towards them with a view to separate them in case of an altercation, but that before he had \n\n[275 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n time to reach them the shot was fired. Fonvielle knew that Dallas had a pistol, but there was a strike at the time. Dallas was a special policeman and had a right to carry it and not unnaturally did. The only sinister designs of which there is any evidence were of Southwell against Dallas, unless Dallas' remark just before the shooting be taken to foreshadow the event, which it certainly did not seem to until after the event had happened. It appears to us extravagant to hold the petitioner liable in a case like this. See St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co. v. Mills, \n271 \nU.S. 344\n, 46 S.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. State of Florida ex rel. Burr, \n273 \nU.S. 691\n, 47 S. Ct. 475. The District Court's opinion is reported in 13 F.(2d) 633; that of the Circuit Court of Appeals in 16 F.(2d) 441.\n The case was begun by a bill in equity filed by the Standard Oil Company, a corporation of Kentucky, in the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, against the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, a corporation of Virginia, to secure an injunction forbidding the defendant from charging the complainant for the transportation of gasoline, refined oil, lubricating oil, and fuel oil from the cities of Port Tampa, Tampa, and Jacksonville, all in Florida, to other points in the same state, \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n at rates of freight other than the lawfully established intrastate rates for such commodities.\n The bill avers that since June 15, 1923, the defendant railroad company has refused to accept shipments of the complainant from Port Tampa, Tampa, and Jacksonville, Fla., to other points within the state, at intrastate rates, and has compelled the complainant to pay thereon higher interstate rates, which it has done under protest; that according to the records of the complainant it has already overpaid to the defendant, between June 15, 1923, and April 17, 1925, the sum of $63,000. The prayer is for a temporary injunction, and that, if the merits of the case are adjudged in favor of the complainant, a permanent injunction be granted and the case be referred to a special master to determine the overcharges, and that a judgment be entered therefor with interest at 6 per cent. from the date the same were accepted by the defendant until paid.\n The answer denies that the charges collected were for other than interstate business. A motion to dismiss was made, on the ground that the complainant had an adequate remedy either at the common law or under a special remedy provided by the Florida statute. This motion to dismiss was overruled by the District Court (Standard Oil Company v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 13 F.(2d) 633), and while on appeal error was assigned for this, it does not appear to have been considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals (Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of Kentucky, 16 F.(2d) 441), and is not assigned for error here. The jurisdiction rests on diverse citizenship of the parties, and the only question before us is upon the merits.\n The plaintiff maintains at Port Tampa, Tampa, and Jacksonville large storage facilities, consisting of tanks and warehouses for receiving and storing gasoline, refined oil, lubricating oil, and fuel oil. It does not produce or refine any of these products. Gasoline, refined oil, and \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n lubricating oil it buys from the Standard Oil Company of Louisiana, from its refineries at Baton Rouge, La., while the fuel oil it buys from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, from Tampico, Mexico. These four varieties of oil products are brought into Port Tampa and Jacksonville in tank steamers owned and chartered by the sellers, and, with the exception of lubricating oil, the oil is pumped by ships' pumps from the steamers through pipe lines owned by the plaintiff into plaintiff's storage tanks at Port Tampa and at St. Johns river terminal, Jacksonville, Fla. Lubricating oil is pumped from the tank steamers by ships' pumps into tank cars at Port Tampa, or at Jacksonville, and by them conveyed, respectively, over defendant's lines to plaintiff's storage tanks at Tampa, a distance of about nine miles from Port Tampa, or to Kings Road, a distance of about two miles from St. Johns river terminal, near Jacksonville. All the products are purchased by the plaintiff to be delivered to it by the sellers at Port Tampa and Jacksonville, title not passing to the plaintiff until the products have been so delivered, settlement between the seller and purchaser being made upon the basis of the amount actually delivered into tank cars and tanks. The prices to be paid for gasoline, refined oil, and lubricating oil are the current market prices in effect at the time the products are delivered to plaintiff at Port Tampa and Jacksonville. Fuel oil is purchased on yearly contracts at stipulated prices. The tank cars used by the plaintiff in its business are not owned by the railroad company, but are leased by the plaintiff and hauled by the defendant over its lines in common carrier service.\n At Port Tampa plaintiff maintains for the storage of gasoline five tanks, with an aggregate capacity of 110,000 barrels; for refined oil, storage tanks with a total capacity of 20,000 barrels; and for fuel oil, tanks with a total capacity of 127,000 barrels. At Jacksonville it maintains \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n for the storage of gasoline, tanks with a total capacity of 162,000 barrels; for refined oil, storage tanks with a capacity of 40,000 barrels; and for fuel oil, storage tanks with a total capacity of 145,000 barrels.\n Throughout Florida the plaintiff maintains 123 bulk stations, where it has sufficient tankage and storage facilities for gasoline, refined oil, and lubricating oil to meet the current needs of its customers supplied from such stations. These stations ordinarily get their supply of gasoline and refined oil from the storage tanks maintained at Port Tampa and Jacksonville, by means of tank cars. Very little, if any, gasoline or refined oil is delivered to consumers directly from the storage tanks at Port Tampa and Jacksonville. The gasoline and refined oils are delivered from the bulk stations to plaintiff's consumers by means of tank wagons. Plaintiff also maintains a large number of service stations in the state of Florida, which, in the usual course of business, are supplied with gasoline and refined oil directly from the bulk stations, although occasionally a service station is supplied with gasoline supplied in tank cars directly from Port Tampa and Jacksonville.\n Under ordinary business conditions plaintiff keeps in its storage tanks at Port Tampa and at Jacksonville a sufficient supply of gasoline and refined oil to take care of its requirements for from 45 to 60 days, a sufficient supply of fuel oil for from 30 to 60 days, and in its storage tanks at Tampa and at Kings Road a sufficient supply of lubricating oil for from 60 to 90 days, the exact time depending entirely upon business conditions and demands for the products in that section of the state. The plaintiff pays local taxes to the state of Florida on all of its products in hand in its storage tanks on the Florida assessing dates.\n After the lubricating oil is placed in the storage tanks at Tampa and at Kings Road, it is distributed and sold in tank wagons, barrels, and smaller containers, although a \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n small percentage of same is sent out in tank wagon cars to plaintiff's bulk stations and possibly to some small consumers.\n The fuel oil is furnished by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey to the plaintiff under a yearly contract for a million barrels to be delivered monthly in tank steamers at Port Tampa and Jacksonville as needed. Approximately 95 per cent. of the fuel oil sold by plaintiff in Florida is on contracts made before the oil has been shipped from the point of origin to plaintiff at Port Tampa and Jacksonville. Most of these are for a period of a year, covering the requirements of the various consumers, with average monthly deliveries stipulated, although in actual practice shipments from the storage tanks to the consumers are accommodated to their needs as under requirement contracts. There is no separation of the fuel oil under contract from that not under contract, all being of the same grade. At the time the shipment of the fuel oil is made from the point of origin, plaintiff cannot say where any particular cargo of same, or any part thereof, will go after it has been pumped into the storage tanks, to whom it will go, or when it will be shipped. At the time of shipment from the point of origin, the only destinations which can be given are Port Tampa and Jacksonville, respectively.\n The railway company has nothing to do with the boat movement of the products used by the plaintiff in its Florida business. There is no through rate and no joint arrangement of any character between the water carrier and the defendant. Movement by boat, while interstate commerce, is not actually under regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission. From two to four boats per month, with an average capacity of 45,000 barrels each, discharge their cargoes in plaintiff's storage facilities at Port Tampa and Jacksonville. A boat requires from one to three days to discharge its cargo, and while boats are \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 266]\n\u00a0\n engaged in discharging their cargoes into the storage tanks of plaintiff, tank cars are being loaded from the same storage tanks, for the purpose of supplying plaintiff's bulk stations, service stations, and possibly a small amount directly to some consumers.\n Plaintiff has been conducting its business in the manner here stated for many years, and it was not adopted for the purpose of evading the payment of interstate rates. Its business could not be conducted without the storage facilities herein described, and until June 15, 1923, all shipments by the plaintiff from Port Tampa, Tampa, and Jacksonville over defendant's lines to other points in Florida over purely intrastate routes, were accepted by the defendant as intrastate commerce. Since June 15, 1923, however, the defendant has classified these shipments as interstate commerce, and collected freight on the basis of interstate rates. Generally in respect to this transportation the intrastate rates approved by the Florida State Commission are lower than the interstate rates under the classification of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and it is the difference in favor of the plaintiff in the intrastate rates which has led to this litigation.\n The District Court held that all the transportation of oil by the defendant for the plaintiff, after the oil reaches the storage tanks or tank cars, in Tampa, Port Tampa, or Jacksonville, is intrastate commerce, and that the plaintiff is entitled to secure the transportation necessary in that commerce at intrastate rates. 13 F.(2d) 633. The Circuit Court of Appeals modified the order of the District Court (16 F. (2d) 441), and held that the fuel oil landed at Port Tampa is a continuous foreign and interstate shipment from Tampico to its ultimate destination in Florida where it is used; that the gasoline and kerosene shipments through to Port Tampa must also be classified as interstate shipment from Baton Rouge to the bulk stations where they are distributed; that the lubricating oils \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 267]\n\u00a0\n received at Port Tampa must be treated as distributed from the Tampa and Jacksonville storage tanks, and that from those places its transportation is to be regarded as intrastate; that as to gasoline and kerosene in Jacksonville, as 13 per cent. of it received into the tanks is used locally at Jacksonville, it must all be regarded as intrastate; that as to Jacksonville fuel oil the record is obscure, and the case must be sent back to the trial court for further evidence.\n These two writs of certiorari are secured, the one by the plaintiff oil company to reverse the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in so far as it reversed the District Court, and the other by the defendant railway company, to reverse that decision in so far as it affirmed the District Court.\n It seems very clear to us on a broad view of the facts that the interstate or foreign commerce in all this oil ends upon its delivery to the plaintiff into the storage tanks or the storage tank cars at the seaboard, and that from there its distribution to storage tanks, tank cars, bulk stations, and drivein stations, or directly by tank wagons to customers, is all intrastate commerce. This distribution is the whole business of the plaintiff in Florida. There is no destination intended and arranged for with the ship carriers in Florida at any point beyond the deliveries from the vessels to the storage tanks or tank cars of the plaintiff. There is no designation of any particular oil for any particular place within Florida beyond the storage receptacles or storage tank cars into which the oil is first delivered by the ships. The title to the oil in bulk passes to the plaintiff as it is thus delivered. When the oil reaches these storage places along the Florida seaboard, it is within the control and ownership of the plaintiff for use for its particular purposes in Florida. The plaintiff is free to distribute the oil according to the demands of its business, and it arranges its storage capacity to meet the \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 268]\n\u00a0\n future variation in its business needs at Tampa, Port Tampa, or Jacksonville, or St. Johns river terminal.\n The question whether commerce is interstate or intrastate must be determined by the essential character of the commerce, and not by mere billing or forms of contract, although that may be one of a group of circumstances tending to show such character. The reshipment of an interstate or foreign shipment does not necessarily establish a continuity of movement or prevent the shipment to a point within the same state from having an independent or intrastate character, even though it be in the same cars. Chicago, M. & St. P Ry. Co. v. Iowa, \n233 \nU.S. 334\n, 34 S. Ct. 592. The change from rail to ship has often been held consistent with a continuity of interstate or foreign commerce, even though there may be only local billing. Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111\n, 33 S. Ct. 229; Railroad Commission of Louisiana v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 336\n, 33 S. Ct. 837; Baer Bros. Mercantile Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Co., \n233 \nU.S. 479\n, 34 S. Ct. 641. On the other hand, in Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Iowa, supra, the reshipment of an interstate shipment of coal after its arrival in the state in the same carload lots was held not inconsistent with the change from interstate to intrastate commerce. In Baltimore & Ohio S. W. R. R. Co. v. Seattle, \n260 \nU.S. 166, 170\n, 43 S. Ct. 28, a shipper billed his goods from one state to another, paying the interstate freight, and reshipped them to another point in the second state, intending from the first to reach the latter destination, but interrupting the transportation only to take advantage of a difference in his favor between the through rate and the sum of those paid. It was held that the essential nature of the entire movement was in interstate commerce and that the shipper must pay the only lawful rate which was the interstate commerce rate to the final destination. These cases are illustrations to show that the determination of the char- \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 269]\n\u00a0\n acter of the commerce is a matter of weighing the whole group of facts in respect to it.\n The important controlling fact in the present controversy, and what characterizes the nature of the commerce involved, is that the plaintiff's whole plan is to arrange deliveries of all of its oil purchases on the seaboard of Florida, so that they may all be there stored for convenient distribution in the state to the 123 bulk stations and to fuel oil plants in varying quantities according to the demand of the plaintiff's customers, and thence be distributed to subordinate centers and delivery stations, and this plan is being carried out daily. There is neither necessity nor purpose to send the oil through these seaboard storage stations to interior points by immediate continuity of transportation. The seaboard storage stations are the natural places for a change from interstate and foreign transportation to that which is intrastate and there is nothing in the history of the whole transaction which makes them otherwise, either in intent or in fact. There is nothing to indicate that the destination of the oil is arranged for or fixed in the minds of the sellers beyond the primary seaboard storages of the plaintiff company at Tampa, Port Tampa, Jacksonville, or the St. Johns river terminal. Everything that is done after the oil is deposited in the storage tanks at the Tampa destinations, or at the Jacksonville destinations is done in the distribution of the oil to serve the purposes of the plaintiff company that imported it. Neither the sellers, who deliver the oil, nor the railroad company, that aids the delivery of the oil to the storage tanks and tank cars at the seaboard, has anything to do with determining what the ultimate destination of the oil is, or has any interest in it, or any duty to discharge in respect to it, except that the railroad company, after the storage in Florida has been established for the purposes of the plaintiff company, accepted the duty \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 270]\n\u00a0\n of transporting it in Florida to the places designated by the plaintiff company.\n The compensation for the transportation of the oil through the pipe lines from the steamers to the storage tanks or to the storage tank cars, and the transportation of those cars to the seaboard storage tanks of the plaintiff, is not here in question, we are not asked to determine whether such deliveries to the storage tanks and cars on the seaboard from the steamers are interstate or foreign commerce.\n We have no hesitation in saying that the nature of the commerce in controversy in this case was intrastate.\n The case is like that of General Oil Company v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S. Ct. 475, in which the General Oil Company sought an injunction against the collection of a tax for the inspection of certain of its oils in Tennessee, which it had brought into Tennessee and stored in tanks, and marked in storage tanks as oil already sold in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and which remained in Tennessee only long enough to be properly distributed according to the order therefor, and other oil in other tanks marked to be sold in those states but for which no orders at the time of shipment from the manufacturing plants had been received. This court held that the Tennessee tax was not a burden on interstate commerce as applied to oil coming from certain states, though ultimately intended for sale and distribution in states other than Tennessee; that the oil was subject to a tax while it was being stored in Tennessee for convenience of distribution and for reshipping in tank cars and barrels; that this was business done in Tennessee, where the oil was brought to rest, and was for a purpose outside its mere transportation.\n It is not a question of maintaining the identity of oil as if a fungible in storage tanks through which it passed. The facts indicate that the plaintiff itself makes no such distinction, and certainly agrees with no one to make such \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 271]\n\u00a0\n a distinction. The fuel oil is not different from the other kinds. While the fuel oil is purchased by the plaintiff from a selling company, which has a year's contract, the seller delivers it from Tampico, at the Florida seaboard, as it is likely to be needed to meet the obligations of a number of yearly contracts made by the plaintiff for its delivery in certain parts of Florida. No oil which comes in is labeled or identified in any particular way with any particular company, except after it is shipped to that company from Tampa or from Jacksonville. There is no passage of title from plaintiff to the contract purchasers and there is no setting apart of particular oil until the shipments are made at the end of this interval of weeks and months in accordance with the needs of those who have contracted to buy it.\n The argument is made that these are continuous streams of oil from Baton Rouge or Tampico into bulk stations in the interior of Florida where it is sold to the customers of the plaintiff, and that its interstate character continues through that entire passage. It may be, as suggested in the argument, that oil is being discharged into plaintiff's receptacles for its storage at the same time that it is being discharged from the storage tanks into storage tank cars for its distribution, but that is not at all inconsistent with its being a closing of an interstate or foreign transportation and a beginning of intrastate distribution for the purposes and business of the plaintiff.\n We think the view of the Supreme Court of Florida in a mandamus case in respect to these very rates is the correct one. State v. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co.; State v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 109 So. 656. We concur in the reasoning and conclusions of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey; Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, 12 F. (2d) 541. \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 272]\n\u00a0\n Reliance is put on Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229, to sustain the claim that this transportation of plaintiff's oil in Florida is interstate commerce. In that case the question under consideration was the validity of the Packers and Stockyards Act of Congress of 1921, c. 64, 42 Stat. 159 (7 USCA  181 et seq.) providing for the supervision by federal authority of the business of the commission men and of the live stock dealers in the great stockyards of the country, and it was held that, for the purpose of protecting interstate commerce from the power of the packers to fix arbitrary prices for live stock and meat through their monopoly of its purchase, preparation in meat, and sales, Congress had power to regulate the business done in the stockyards, although there was a good deal of it which was, strictly speaking, only intrastate commerce. It was held that a reasonable fear upon the part of Congress, that acts usually affecting only intrastate commerce when occurring alone, would probably and more or less constantly be performed in aid of conspiracies against interstate commerce, or constitute a direct and undue obstruction and restraint of it, would serve to bring such acts within lawful federal statutory restraint.\n The court relied much on the case of United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S. Ct. 445, where the validity of an act of Congress, punishing forgery and utterance of bills of lading for fictitious shipments in interstate commerce, was in question. It was there contended that there was and could be no commerce on a fraudulent and fictitious bill of lading, and therefore that the power of Congress could not embrace such pretended bill. In upholding the act, this court, speaking, through Chief Justice White, answered the objection by saying:\n'But this mistakenly assumes that the power of Congress is to be necessarily tested by the intrinsic existence of commerce in the particular subject dealt with, instead of by the relation of that subject to commerce and its \n\n[275 U.S. 257, 273]\n\u00a0\n effect upon it. We say mistakenly assumes, because we think it clear that if the proposition were sustained it would destroy the power of Congress to regulate, as obviously that power, if it is to exist, must include the authority to deal with obstructions to interstate commerce (In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n, 15 S. Ct. 900), and which a host of other acts which, because of their relation to and influence upon interstate commerce, come within the power of Congress to regulate, although they are not interstate commerce in and of themselves.'\n\n The use of this authority as a basis for the conclusion in Stafford v. Wallace clearly shows that the case cannot be cited to show what is interstate and what is intrastate commerce in a controversy over rates to determine whether they come normally within the regulation of federal or state authority.\n Our conclusion is that, in all the cases presented by the plaintiff in its bill, intrastate rates should have been applied, and should be applied in the future, so long as the facts remain as they are now. This leads to a reversal of the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as to fuel oil from Port Tampa, as to gasoline and kerosene from Tampa, and an affirmation of its decision as to lubricating oil through Port Tampa; an affirmation of its decision as to gasoline from Jacksonville, as to kerosense from Jacksonville, and as to Lubricating oil from Jacksonville. As to fuel oil from Jacksonville, the Circuit Court of Appeals left the matter undetermined. We think that fuel oil also from Jacksonville should be treated as subject to intrastate rates. The result is that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is partly affirmed and partly reversed, that of the District Court is wholly affirmed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O.

Harlan, both of Dayton, Ohio, and William A. Eggers and Morison R. Waite, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Robert N. Brumbaugh and I. L. Jacobson, both of Dayton, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the widow and administratrix of Nathan Goodman against the petitioner for causing his death by running him down at a grade crossing. The defence is that Goodman's own negligence caused the death. At the trial the defendant asked the Court to direct a verdict for it, but the request and others looking to the same direction were refused, and the plaintiff got a verdict and a judgment which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 10 F.(2d) 58.\n Goodman was driving an automobile truck in an easterly direction and was killed by a train running southwesterly across the road at a rate of not less than 60 miles an hour. The line was straight but it is said by the respondent that Goodman 'had no practical view' beyond a section house 243 feet north of the crossing until he was about 20 feet from the first rail, or, as the respondent argues, 12 feet from danger, and that then the engine was stiil obscured by the section house. He had been driving at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour but had cut down his rate to 5 or 6 miles at about 40 feet from the crossing. It is thought that there was an emergency in which, so far as appears, Goodman did all that he could.\n We do not go into further details as to Goodman's precise situation, beyond mentioning that it was daylight and that he was familiar with the crossing, for it appears to us plain that nothing is suggested by the evidence to relieve Goodman from responsibility for his own death. When a man goes upon a railroad track he knows that he goes to a place where he will be killed if a train comes upon him before he is clear of the track. He knows that \n\n[275 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n he must stop for the train not the train stop for him. In such circumstances it seems to us that if a driver cannot be sure otherwise whether a train is dangerously near he must stop and get out of his vehicle, although obviously he will not often be required to do more than to stop and look. It seems to us that if he relies upon not hearing the train or any signal and takes no further precaution he does so at his own risk. If at the last moment Goodman found himself in an emergency it was his own fault that he did not reduce his speed earlier or come to a stop. It is true as said in Flannelly v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n225 \nU.S. 597, 603\n, 32 S. Ct. 783, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 154, that the question of due care very generally is left to the jury. But we are dealing with a standard of conduct, and when the standard is clear it should be laid down once for all by the Courts. See Southern Pacific Co. v.

A libel was filed in admiralty to recover damages in the sum of $15,000 against the petitioners and the United States in the federal District Court for the district of Maryland. The libel alleged that the injury was caused by negligence in failing to provide a safe place to work, and to use reasonable care to avoid striking respondent, and by the unseaworthiness and insufficiency of the gear and tackle employed on the vessel. By an amendment, further specifications of negligence were added to the effect that the United States had failed to provide a proper and sufficient gear or socket to support the strongback, that the officers of the vessel were incompetent, and that there was owing to the injured person a special duty because of his youth and inexperience. Libelant prayed that, if negligence should not be established, he have a decree for wages, maintenance and cure. After a trial, the District Court held that upon the evidence the accident was not due to the negligence alleged but to the grossly negligent way in which dunnage was taken out of the hold, and that under the decisions no recovery could be had for damages upon that ground. By the decree libelant was denied full indemnity by way of damages and awarded the sum of $500 as the cost of maintenance and cure, and this amount was paid and the decree satisfied. Phillips v.

The complaint alleges negligence on the part of the petitioners and their officers and employees in the control and operation of the vessel and appliances. The allegations of fact as to the way in which the accident happened are substantially the same in both cases. Petitioners answered in the present case, setting up, among other things, \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 319]\n\u00a0\n the decree in the admiralty case as res judicata, and by stipulation of the parties this was argued before trial. The District Court at first sustained the plea, but, upon reargument, set aside its order to that effect and held the plea bad. A trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, holding in respect of the plea of res judicata that the second action was based upon a different cause of action. 9 F.(2d) 902. And this presents the sole question for consideration here.\n The effect of a judgment or decree as res judicata depends upon whether the second action or suit is upon the same or a different cause of action. If upon the same cause of action, the judgment or decree upon the merits in the first case is an absolute bar to the subsequent action or suit between the same parties or those in privity with them, not only in respect of every matter which was actually offered and received to sustain the demand, but also as to every ground of recovery which might have been presented. But if the second case be upon a different cause of action, the prior judgment or decree operates as an estoppel only as to matters actually in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the judgment or decree was rendered. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351, 352\n, 353 S.; United States v. Moser, \n266 \nU.S. 236, 241\n, 45 S. Ct. 66. There is some confusion in the decisions as to whether the present case should fall within the first or the second branch of the rule, but we are of opinion that the great weight of authority, both in respect of the number of decisions and upon reason, sustains the view that the facts here gave rise to a single cause of action for damages and that the first branch of the rule applies. In United States v. California & Ore. Land Co., \n192 \nU.S. 355\n, 24 S. Ct. 266, this court announced the general rule to be that a judgment or decree upon the merits concludes the parties as to all media concludendi or grounds \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 320]\n\u00a0\n for asserting the right, known when the suit was brought. In that case a bill had been brought to have certain patents for land issued by the United States declared void on the ground that the lands were within an Indian reservation and, therefore, reserved from the operation of the grant. The land company pleaded in bar that the United States had filed an earlier bill seeking the same relief and that a final decree had been entered dismissing that bill. The only thing which the court could find to distinguish the two suits was that in the latter the United States had put forward a new ground for its prayer, but in both cases it sought to establish its own title to the fee. This court sustained the plea in bar, saying:\n'But the whole tendency of our decisions is to require a plaintiff to try his whole cause of action and his whole case at one time. He cannot even split up his claim. Fetter v. Beale, 1 Salk. 11; Trask v. Hartford & New Haven Railroad, 2 Allen (Mass.) 331; Freeman, Judgments (4th Ed.)  238, 241. And, a fortiori, he cannot divide the grounds of recovery. Unless the statute of 1889 (25 Stat. 850) put the former suit upon a peculiar footing, the United States was bound then to bring forward all the grounds it had for declaring the patents void, and when the bill was dismissed was barred as to all by the decree.'\n\n The same general doctrine is stated in Stark v. Starr, \n94 U.S. 477\n, 485 (24 L. Ed. 276), that:\n'A party seeking to enforce a claim, legal or equitable, must present to the court, either by the pleadings or proofs, or both, all the grounds upon which he expects a judgment in his favor. He is not at liberty to split up his demand and prosecute it by piecemeal, or present only a portion of the grounds upon which special relief is sought, and leave the rest to be presented in a second suit, if the first fail. There would be no end to litigation if such a practice were permissible.'\n\n And see also, Werlein v. New Orleans, \n177 U.S. 390\n, 398-400, 20 S. Ct. 682. \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 321]\n\u00a0\n Here the court below concluded that the cause of action set up in the second case was not the same as that alleged in the first, because the grounds of negligence pleaded were distinct and different in character; the ground alleged in the first case being the use of defective appliances, and in the second, the negligent operation of the appliances by the officers and coemployees. Upon principle, it is perfectly plain that the respondent suffered but one actionable wrong, and was entitled to but one recovery, whether his injury was due to one or the other of several distinct acts of alleged negligence, or to a combination of some or all of them. In either view, there would be but a single wrongful invasion of a single primary right of the plaintiff, namely, the right of bodily safety, whether the acts constituting such invasion were one or many, simple or complex.\n A cause of action does not consist of facts, but of the unlawful violation of a right which the facts show. The number and variety of the facts alleged do not establish more than one cause of action so long as their result, whether they be considered severally or in combination, is the violation of but one right by a single legal wrong. The mere multiplication of grounds of negligence alleged as causing the same injury does not result in multiplying the causes of action. 'The facts are merely the means, and not the end. They do not constitute the cause of action, but they show its existence by making the wrong appear. 'The thing, therefore, which in contemplation of law as its cause, becomes a ground for action, is not the group of facts alleged in the declaration, bill, or indictment, but the result of these in a legal wrong, the existence of which, if true, they conclusively evince.\" Chobanian v. Washburn Wire Company, 33 R. I. 289, 302, 80 A. 394, 400 (Ann. Cas. 1913D, 730).\n The injured respondent was bound to set forth in his first action for damages every ground of negligence which \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 322]\n\u00a0\n he claimed to exist and upon which he relied, and cannot be permitted, as was attempted here, to rely upon them by piecemeal in successive actions to recover for the same wrong and injury. Columb v. Webster Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 84 F. 592, 43 L. R. A. 195; Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. Ry. Co. v. Gray ( C. C. A.) 101 F. 623, 631, 50 L. R. A. 47; Smith v. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. ( C. C. A.) 56 F. 458; Payne v. N. Y., S. & W. R. R. Co., 201 N. Y. 436, 440, 95 N. E. 19; Chobanian v. Washburn Wire Company, supra, pages 300-304, 80 A. 399, 400; Senn v. Southern Ry. Co., 135 Mo. 512, 519, 36 S. W. 367; Munro v. Railroad, 155 Mo. App. 710, 727, 135 S. W. 1016; Schweinfurth, Adm'r v. Railway Co., 60 Ohio St. 215, 230, 231, 54 N. E. 89; Berube v. Horton, 199 Mass. 421, 425, 426, 85 N. E. 474. Many other cases are to the same effect. In the case last cited there was a declaration in an action for personal injuries containing a count at common law alleging failure to provide a reasonably safe place, and a count under the Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665) alleging a defect in the ways, works, or machinery. To this declaration, after the expiration of the period of the statute of limitations, an amendment was allowed alleging negligence of the defendant's superintendent as the cause of the same accident. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the statute of limitations could not be invoked because the amendment did not state a new cause of action, but was simply another statement of the same cause of action, that cause of action being 'the injury under the circumstances under which it took place.'\n Respondent cites and relies upon The Rolph (C. C. A.) 299 F. 52; but the case is not in point. There the first action was for wages and maintenance alone. Here, in the first action, negligence causing a personal injury was distinctly alleged as the primary ground of recovery. The claim for wages, maintenance and cure was purely dependent and contingent.\n The judgment of the court below, as shown by its opinion, was based, in the main if not entirely, upon Troxell \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 323]\n\u00a0\n v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 434\n, 33 S. Ct. 274, which was construed as holding 'that it was one cause of action not to furnish safe cars, and another to use safe cars carelessly.' The opinion in that case is not to be read as announcing any such general rule. If so, in the light of the foregoing discussion, we now should feel obliged to disaffirm it. But the decision rests upon another and a narrow ground, and its authority must be confined accordingly. Mrs. Troxell as surviving widow prosecuted an action against the railway company under a state statute to recover for the death of her husband as the result of a negligent failure to provide safe instrumentalities. After a judgment against her, she brought a second action as administratrix under the federal Employers' Liability Act, alleging as ground of recovery negligence of a fellow servant. The first case was tried and decided exclusively upon the state law, under which law, as this court said, 'there could be no recovery for the negligence of the fellow servants of the deceased,' and consequently that ground, it was said, was not and could not be involved in or concluded by the first action-in other words, as matter of law recovery upon that ground was not open to her in the first action. Obviously, if the court had been of opinion that a recovery upon that ground of negligence could have been had in the action prosecuted under the state law, the decision would have sustained the view that there was but one cause of action.\n Whether the later decision in Wabash R. R. v. Hayes, \n234 \nU.S. 86, 90\n, 34 S. Ct. 729, has rendered doubtful the soundness of this conclusion even as thus narrowly limited (see Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Yurkonis (C. C. A.) 220 F. 429, 433), we do not pause to consider. It is enough to say that here, as we shall proceed to show, both actions were brought under the same federal law, and the basis upon which the Troxell decision rested is entirely lacking. \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 324]\n\u00a0\n The injury to respondent occurred after the passage of the amendment of Act March 4, 1915,  20, by the Merchant Marine Act,  33, c. 250 (41 Stat. 988, 1007 (Comp. St.  8337a)), which provides:\n'That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply. ...'\n\n That amendment incorporates into the maritime law the provisions of the federal Employers' Liability Act (35 Stat. 65, c. 149 (Comp. St.  8657-8665)); and the effect by virtue of section 1 of that act (Comp. St.  8657) is to give a right of action for an injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of the ship, as well as for an injury or death resulting from defects due to negligence, etc., and irrespective of whether the action is brought in admiralty or at law. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391; Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33\n, 46 S. Ct. 410; Panama R. R. Co. v. Vasquez, \n271 \nU.S. 557\n, 46 S. Ct. 596\n\n\n It follows that here both the libel and the subsequent action were prosecuted under the maritime law, and every ground of recovery, open to respondent in the second case, was equally open to him in the first. But evidently in the first proceeding both court and counsel misinterpreted the effect of section 33, and proceeded upon the erroneous theory, that in admiralty the rule laid down in The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S. Ct. 483, 487 (47 L. Ed. 760), 'that the seaman is not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master, or any member of the crew, but is entitled to maintenance and cure, whether the injuries were received by negligence or accident,' was still in force. Otherwise, it is quite apparent from the language of the opinion that an amendment would \n\n[274 U.S. 316, 325]\n\u00a0\n have been sought and allowed, pleading the ground of negligence afterwards set up in the second action. Nevertheless, the cause of action was one and indivisible, and the erroneous conclusion to the contrary cannot have the effect of depriving the defendants in the second action of their right to rely upon the plea of res judicata. Plaintiff's claim for damages having been submitted and passed upon, the effect of the judgment in the admiralty case as a bar is the same whether resting upon an erroneous view of the law or not. A judgment merely voidable because based upon an erroneous view of the law is not open to collateral attack, but can be corrected only by a direct review and not by bringing another action upon the same cause. Colburn v. Woodworth, 31 Barb. (N. Y.) 381, 384; Wolverton v. Baker, 86 Cal. 591, 593, 25 P. 54; Bettys v. The C. M. & St. P. R. Co., 43 Iowa, 602, 604; Bancroft v. Winspear, 44 Barb. (N. Y.) 209, 215, 216; Winslow v. Stokes, 48 N. C. 285, 67 Am. Dec. 242.\n The conclusion that the judgment below must be reversed cannot be avoided without subverting long-established principles of general application, which we are not at liberty to set aside for a special case of hardship.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARRETT CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A. King and Wm. Bruce King, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor General Mitchell, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the Court of Claims, under sections 242 and 243 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219, 1220), from a judgment of February 16, 1925, before the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925,  14, c. 229 (43 Stat. 936).\n The findings of fact by the Court of Claims show that the Barrett Company, the claimant and appellant, a corporation under the laws of New Jersey, entered into a contract with the United States by which it undertook, with funds provided by the government, to erect a plant at Frankford, Pa., for the distillation of xylol at the rate of 225,000 gallons per month, and, after completion, to operate the plant until a total of 2,700,000 gallons of xylol had been produced. The xylol was to be distilled and refined from special solvent naptha fur- \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n nished by the government, and was at all times to belong to the Navy. The by-products, except what the Navy wished to retain, were to belong to the Barrett Company as part of its profit, but not to be sold without the Navy's written consent. Ninety per cent. of the by-products sold by the company was to be credited to the account of the Navy, less one cent a gallon for rental of containers used for shipment.\n The price to be paid by the Navy to the company was to be determined monthly for the preceding month by the actual deliveries, first by a charge per gallon of xylol, prorating the total approved estimated cost of the new plant against the 2,700,000 gallons to be made under the contract. At the same time the account of the Navy was to be credited with this charge as the total approved estimated cost would have been advanced by the United States to the company before the production of the xylol would begin. To cover operating cost, there was to be a charge of 3 cents per gallon of naptha distilled, and an additional charge for redistillation of fractions. These charges were to be multiplied by the gallons of naptha distilled, and the resulting aggregate was to be divided by the number of gallons produced monthly, to which 6.6 cents per gallon was to be added to cover overhead, profit, and use of patents.\n The new plant was to be an annex to the appellant's existing distillation plant and equipment. The estimated cost to be furnished by the government was to be exhibited to the authorities of the Navy Department for approval prior to the execution of the contract, and was to consist of two parts. First, there was to be an itemized estimate to cover the cost of the separate unit plant and equipment; and, second, an itemized estimate to cover the cost of parts of the plant and equipment needed for the supply of electric power, steam, water, and light which would not be distinctly separate from the existing \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n plant and equipment of the company. One-half of the sum to be advanced for construction was to be paid by the government at the time of the execution of the contract, and the balance in two months. Plant and equipment were to be ready for operation within five months from the date of the contract, and to be continued in operation until the company had delivered the full amount of 2,700,000 gallons of xylol to E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. The xylol provided for in the contract was to be employed in the manufacture of trinitroxylol for use in mine barrage in the North Sea, and was a new product requiring knowledge and skill in its manufacture. The plant, when completed, was to belong to the government. The company agreed to offer and to pay 25 per cent. of the approved estimated cost for it, if accepted after the contract was performed, but the government could dispose of it as it chose.\n I was stipulated in the contract that the Barrett Company should furnish a bond for the faithful performance of the contract equal to the approved estimate of the cost of construction; that time was an essential element in the contract; that by failure to make delivery, in conformith with the requirements of the contract and within the times prescribed, the United States would be damaged; that the damage should be liquidated for each day's delay at the rate of a certain per cent. of the contract price, and legal excuse for delays was to be determined by the United States.\n The company's estimate for the separate unit and equipment was $192, 547.80, and that for the plant for supplying electric power, steam, water, and light was $60,773.32, a total of $253,321.12. These estimates were approved by the Navy Department, and one-half of the cost, $126,660.56, was advanced to the plaintiff on the execution of the contract, and the remainder was paid two months thereafter. \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n On May 18th, 1918, the Navy Department gave notice to the company that it might proceed immediately upon the construction of the plant. It did so, and completed the separate plant at a cost of $284,882.66. The electric, steam, water, and light plant had been, at the time of the Armistice, about half constructed at a cost of $52,897.53. The total expenditure on plant and equipment by the company was thus $337,780.19, or $ 84,459 more than the estimates submitted by the plaintiff. The increased cost of construction was due to the increases in the cost of labor and materials and a change in construction from steel and brick to reinforced concrete and brick, due to inability to secure steel, and to certain changes in the tanks as originally proposed in order to increase their capacity. None of these changes was either directly authorized or approved by the Navy Department, but it does appear that the department had knowledge of the changes and made no objection thereto.\n After the Armistice, November 18, 1918, the Navy Department notified the plaintiff that the manufacture of xylol under the contract should be discontinued, that construction work remaining to be completed under the contract would not be undertaken, and the fact that the Navy would receive a partly finished plant would be considered in the final adjustment to be made with regard to the contract. The Navy thereafter discontinued further supply of naptha, and work under the contract was terminated.\n The Navy Department on December 1, 1918, made a supplementary agreement with the company, by which the company bought the whole plant for $110,000. This supplemental contract contained the following:\n'It is further agreed that this supplementary contract does not prejudice the right of the contractor to secure payment of claims in settlement for the termination of the original contract No. 38925 by the government.' \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n From the xylol produced and delivered for three months, the company made a profit of $7,195.59. It was testified by accountants that the profits to the company on the undelivered part would have been $73,792.66, and that its profits from the future by-products would have been $8,237, but these results were uncertain and problematical.\n\n The Court of Claims allowed four items claimed by the appellant, amounting in all to $10,995.08, and for this amount gave judgment.\n The statute under which this contract was canceled by authority of the President, and under which this suit was brought, provides that, 'whenever the United States shall cancel, ... suspend or requisition any contract, ... it shall make just compensation therefor, to be determined by the President,' and, if the amount determined by him is unsatisfactory to the claimant, he may sue the government to recover such sum as added to that which he may have already received, will be just compensation therefor. Act June 15, 1917, c. 29 (40 Stat. 183), being Comp. St.  3115 1\/16 d.\n The appellant makes but three assignments of error.\n\n\n (1)\n That the court held that the supplemental contract of December 1, 1920, was a bar to reimbursement of claimant for expenditures in connection with the erection of the plant.\n\n\n (2)\n That it failed to allow claimant as just compensation for cancellation $84,459.07 expended for construction of plant over and above the approved estimate.\n\n\n (3)\n That it did not allow interest on the sum included in the judgment.\n First. The Court of Claims seems to have held that the supplemental contract by which the company purchased the plant for $110,000 operated as a final settlement of all claims it had against the government. In its opinion, speaking of the purchase, it said:\n'In many respects this transaction alone would be sufficient to preclude the recovery claimed for this item of \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n loss. It was a final adjustment of losses with respect to this particular controversy.'\n\n We are unable to see that the supplemental agreement could have any such effect, in view of the specific clause of the supplemental contract stipulating that the claims of the contractor should not be prejudiced thereby.\n Second. The Solicitor General tenders to the court the opinion of the Court of Claims and an extract from the brief of the United States in that court, to show the argument there made against including in the recovery of the plaintiff as part of just compensation the amount expended by it in excess of the estimate it made for the cost of the plants to be erected. The Solicitor General, however, finds himself obliged to assist the court ( and in this we think he is to be commended) in presenting a view adverse to the conclusion of the Court of Claims and to the contention of the United States in that court.\n The Court of Claims in its opinion said upon this point:\n'It is true the plaintiff, because of emergency conditions, determined to go beyond its express warrant of authority and incur added expense in the construction of the desired plant; but the contract itself contemplated no such increased expense, and there were manifestly no contractual obligations imposed upon the plaintiff to do what it did do. But, says the plaintiff, except for the exercise of the right of termination, the additional expense of construction would have been amortized in the total profits received upon completion, and therefore becomes a sum indispensably necessary to make the plaintiff whole. Apparently a sufficient answer is the assumption of such risk by the plaintiff. The right to terminate under the statute was part of the contract, and an unauthorized expense incurred depended for reimbursement upon the contingency of its exercise. What the plaintiff did, over and above the limitation of its contractual obligations and rights, it did of its own free will \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n and assumed the hazards of recouping the same out of its final profits, in the event the contract proceeded to conclusion. It is not asserted that the contract supports the plaintiff's contention. The contention is predicated entirely upon the theory of just compensation. We have been unable to resolve the issue in plaintiff's favor. The just compensation to which the plaintiff is entitled, under the cases heretofore considered by the court, is limited to the stipulations of the contract, which by its terms imposed obligations and reciprocal rights and privileges upon the parties to the contract . ... The contract fixed the status of the parties thereunder. If one goes beyond its terms it is difficult to perceive how financial obligations to pay more than is agreed to be paid can be inferred on the single theory that the defendant in the exercise of a lawful right terminated all further proceedings under the same and is held thereafter to account for no more than just compensation. In view of the cases cited the just compensation to be awarded must be a loss lawfully resulting from a performance of the contract according to its terms, and may not embrace one occasioned by the contractor's departure from the contract, although considered by the contractor at the time as expedient and in promotion of the rapid completion of the whole contract.'\n\n We cannot concur in this view of the effect of cancellation, under the circumstances and the terms of the contract. We think, with the Solicitor General, that the provisions for the construction of the plant and the production and payment of the product and the disposition of the by-products are all to be construed together as one contract. The main obligation of the company and the chief purpose of the contract was to furnish to the government 2,700,000 gallons of xylol at 225,000 gallons monthly. All else was incidental and ancillary to that. It was obliged to distill 225,000 gallons monthly in the months required. The money to be advanced by \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 235]\n\u00a0\n the government was doubtless an indispensable aid to the company's fulfillment of its contract. The estimates limiting the amount were in the interest of the government. But the possibility that the estimates might not furnish a plant of sufficient capacity to do the work within the time mentioned did not relieve the company, and, if it thought a larger expenditure necessary for this, it must make it. Just compensation for canceling the contract requires that the contractor shall be made whole and recover the expenditures necessary to perform the contract. It would have been no defense, had the company failed to perform and the government had sued for a breach, that the plant erected upon the estimate was not sufficient to do what was agreed. That was the contractor's risk.\n The contract in fixing the elements of the price per gallon of xylol speaks of adding 6.6 cents to cover overhead, profit, and use of patents; but we are not concerned with profits in this case. Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514\n, 43 S. Ct. 428; College Point Boat Corporation v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 12\n, 45 S. Ct. 199.\n What the company is entitled to is just compensation for the contract which was taken from it, and under the cases just cited it should certainly be credited with the outlay which it can show there was reasonable ground for making in order to fulfill its engagements. On the other hand, the government may show, without regard to the estimates, that the actual additional expenditures were really not required for the fulfillment of the contract, or, if less than what was spent was needed, then how much less. The case must be remanded for new evidence and new findings on this issue.\n The other assignment of error is to the failure of the Court of Claims to allow interest on that which was or should be recovered. In support of this assignment of error the appellant contends that, as prospective profits \n\n[273 U.S. 227, 236]\n\u00a0\n cannot be calculated as part of the recovery in a cancellation case, and as just compensation under the decision in the Seaboard Air Line Case, \n261 \nU.S. 299\n, 43 S. Ct. 354, must include interest on the amount due from the time of cancellation, interest must be allowed here. The government argues that as this contract was made after the power of cancellation was given by the statute, its provision for the cancellation must be regarded as written into the contract (Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514\n, 43 S. Ct. 428; College Point Boat Corporation v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 12\n, 45 S. Ct. 199); that, when so written in, cancellation is part of the risk run under the contract, and therefore that interest on the amount due under the contract cannot be collected because of lack of specific agreement for it under section 177 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1168). This exact point has never been decided by the court. Several especially set cases are now pending in which this is the sole issue raised. As the case must go back for further consideration, we prefer to leave the point undecided and to await the argument in those cases, which will probably be disposed of before the issue here will be ready for further consideration by the Court of Claims in this case.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed and remanded for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEDFORD CUT STONE CO. v.

Walter Gordon Merritt, of New York City, Daniel Davenport, of Bridgeport, Conn., and Charles Martindale, of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioners.\n Mr. Moses B. Lairy, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 37, 41]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, Bedford Cut Stone Company and 23 others, all, with one or two exceptions, Indiana corporations, are in the business of quarrying or fabricating, or both quarrying and fabricating, Indiana limestone, in what is called the Bedford-Bloomington district in the state of Indiana. Their combined investment is about $6,000,000, and their annual aggregate sales amount to about $15,000,000, more than 75 per cent. of which are made in interstate commerce to customers outside the state of Indiana. The Journeymen Stone Cutters' Association of North America, sometimes called and hereinafter referred as the 'General Union,' is an association of mechanics engaged in the stone-cutting trade. It has a constitution, by- laws, and officers, and an income derived from assessments upon its members. Its principal headquarters are in Indiana, and it has a membership of about 5,000 persons, divided into over 150 local unions, located in various states and in Canada, each of such local unions having its own by-laws, officers, and income derived from like assessments. By virtue of his membership, each member of these local unions is a member of the General Union. The members of the General Union and allied locals throughout the United States are stone cutters, carvers, curb cutters, curb setters, bridge cutters, planermen, lathemen, and carborundum moulding machine operators, engaged in the cutting, patching, and fabrication of all natural and artificial stones; and the General Union claims jurisdiction over all of them.\n This suit was brought by petitioners against the General Union and some of its officers, and a number of affiliated local unions and some of their officers, to enjoin \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 42]\n\u00a0\n them from combining and conspiring together to commit, and from committing, various acts in restraint of interstate commerce in violation of the federal Anti-Trust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.), and to petitioners' great and irreparable damage. The federal District Court for the District of Indiana, after a hearing, refused a preliminary injunction, and subsequently, on final hearing, entered a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity. On appeal, this decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals upon the authority of an earlier opinion in the same case. 9 F.(2d) 40.\n The facts, so far as necessary to be stated, follow. Limestone produced by petitioners is quarried and fabricated largely for building construction purposes. The stone is first taken in rough blocks from the earth, and generally then cut into appropriate sizes and sometimes planed. Part of this product is shipped directly to buildings, where it is fitted, trimmed, and set in place; the remainder being sold in the rough to contractors to be fabricated. The stone sold in interstate commerce comes into competition with other kinds of natural and artificial stone. The principal producers of artificial stone are unionized and are located outside of Indiana. Before 1921, petitioners carried on their work in Indiana under written agreement with the General Union, but since that time they have operated under agreements with unaffiliated unions, with the effect of closing their shops and quarries against the members of the General Union and its locals. Prior to the filing of the bill of complaint, the General Union issued a notice to all its locals and members, directing its members not to work on stone 'that has been started-planed, turned, cut, or semifinished-by men working in \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 43]\n\u00a0\n opposition to our organization,' and setting forth that a convention of the union had determined that 'members were to rigidly enforce the rule to keep off all work started by men working in opposition to our organization, with the exception of the work of Shea-Donnelly, which firm holds an injunction against our association.' Stone produced by petitioners by labor eligible to membership in respondents' unions was declared 'unfair'; and the president of the General Union announced that the rule against handling such stone was to be promptly enforced in every part of the country. Most of the stone workers employed, outside the state of Indiana, on the buildings where petitioners' product is used, are members of the General Union; and, in most of the industrial centers, building construction is on a closed shop union basis.\n The rule requiring members to refrain from working on 'unfair' stone was persistently adhered to and effectively enforced against petitioners' product, in a large number of cities and in many states. The evidence shows many instances of interference with the use of petitioners' stone by interstate customers, and expressions of apprehension on the part of such customers of labor troubles if they purchased the stone. The president of the General Union himself testified, in effect, that generally the men were living up to the order, and, if it were shown to him that they did not do so in any place, he would see that they did. Members found working on petitioners' product were ordered to stop and threatened with a revocation of their cards if they continued; and the order of the General Union seems to have been enforced even when it might be against the desire of the local union. The transcript contains the record of a hearing upon these matters before the Colorado Industrial Commission, from which it appears that, in obedience to the order of the General Union, its members theretofore employed in Denver upon local building stopped work because petitioners' product was being used. The local contractor was notified merely that the men stopped work because the stone being used was \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 44]\n\u00a0\n 'unfair.' The contractor personally had no trouble of any kind with the union, and no other reason for the strike than that stated above existed. B. F. James, a member and an acting officer of the General Union, testified that the local union, in conducting its strike against a local builder, had no choice in the matter; that they had their orders from the General Union, with which they complied; that there was no difference or feeling whatever between the union and the local employer; that the fight was with the Bedford stone producers, and they were trying to affect them through the local employer.\n'Q. And you people have no choice in the matter, you are just complying with the orders from the International (General Union)?\n\n'A. We have no choice whatever.\n\n'Q. Probably, if it was left up to you people here, knowing this employer as you do, why your organization here, local organization, would not strike on this man?\n\n'A. I don't believe we would; no.\n\n'Q. But you have got to follow the orders of your international organization?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.'\n\n The evidence makes plain that neither the General Union nor the locals had any grievance against any of the buildings-local purchasers of the stone-or any other local grievance, and that the strikes were ordered and conducted for the sole purpose of preventing the use and, consequently, the sale and shipment in interstate commerce, of petitioners' product, in order, by threatening the loss or serious curtailment of their interstate market, to force petitioners to the alternative of coming to undesired terms with the members of these unions. In 1924, the president of the General Union said:\n'The natural stone industry needs all the natural advantages it can possibly get, as there are so many kinds \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 45]\n\u00a0\n of substitutes to take the natural stone's place in the building material market, that it behooves the natural stone employers to do their utmost to see that no handicap is in its way, and it is a well- known fact that, when any material is known to have labor grievances, it retards that material in the building market, as the building public do not want the stigma on their building that it was built by 'unfair labor,' and they are also afraid of stoppage of work and unnecessary disputes while their building is in course of construction, and no one can blame them for that.'\n\n In the Colorado inquiry, the witness James further testified that the strike order did not make any allowance for stone theretofore ordered. 'We were trying to affect the Bedford people through the local man.'\n'Q. So the only person injured would be your own local man, who is your employer, and your personal friend, is that it?\n\n'A. In a way. If it was finished that way, he would be the only one hurt. We are not fighting on this Denver man. We are trying to force these people through the other subcontractors all over the country.\n\n'Q. You are trying to force the Bedford to employ members of your union to do this work?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. And, irrespective of who it hurts, that is the object?\n\n'A. That is the object. It is done from our headquarters.\n\n'Q. Mr. Fernald, or anybody else, they have got to get out of the road; that is the object?\n\n'A. We are trying to gain this point, irrespective of who it hurts.'\n\n From a consideration of all the evidence, it is apparent that the enforcement of the general order to strike against petitioners' product could have had no purpose other than \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 46]\n\u00a0\n that of coercing or inducing the local employers to refrain from purchasing such product. To accept the assertion made here to the contrary would be to say that the order and the effort to enforce it were vain and idle things, without any rational purpose whatsoever. And, indeed, on the argument, in answer to a question from the bench, counsel for respondents very frankly said that, unless petitioners' interstate trade in the so- called unfair stone were injuriously affected, the strikes would accomplish nothing.\n That the means adopted to bring about the contemplated restraint of commerce operated after physical transportation had ended is immaterial. Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 301\n, 28 S. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815; Boyle v. United States (C. C. A.) 259 F. 803, 805, 806. The product against which the strikes were directed, it is true, had come to rest in the respective localities to which it had been shipped, so that it had ceased to be a subject of interstate commerce (Industrial Ass'n v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 78\n, 79 S., 45 S. Ct. 403); and interferences for a purely local object with its use, with no intention, express or implied, to restrain interstate commerce, it may be assumed, would not have been a violation of the Anti-Trust Act (Id., page 77 (45 S. Ct. 403); United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 410\n, 411 S., 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762). But these interferences were not thus in pursuit of a local motive-they had for their primary aim restraint of the interstate sale and shipment of the commodity. Interstate commerce was the direct object of attack, 'for the sake of which the several specific acts and courses of conduct (were) done and adopted.' And the restraint of such commerce was the necessary consequence of the acts and conduct and the immediate end in view. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 397\n, 25 S. Ct. 276. Prevention of the use of petitioners' product, which, without more, might have been a purely local matter, therefore, was only a part of the conspiracy, which must be construed as an \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 47]\n\u00a0\n entirety; and, when so regarded, the local transactions become a part of the general plan and purpose to destroy or narrow petitioners' interstate trade. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38, 45\n, 46 S., 24 S. Ct. 307. In other words, strikes against the local use of the product were simply the means adopted to effect the unlawful restraint. And it is this result, not the means devised to secure it, which gives character to the conspiracy.\n Respondents' chief contention is that 'their sole and only purpose ... was to unionize the cutters and carvers of stone at the quarries.' And it may be conceded that this was the ultimate and in view. But how was that end to be effect? The evidence shows indubitably that it was by an attack upon the use of the product in other states to which it had been and was being shipped, with the intent and purpose of bringing about the loss or serious reduction of petitioners' interstate business, and thereby forcing compliance with the demands of the unions. And, since these strikes were directed against the use of petitioners' product in other states, with the plain design of suppressing or narrowing the interstate market, it is no answer to say that the ultimate object to be accomplished was to bring about a change of conduct on the part of petitioners in respect of the employment of union members in Indiana. A restraint of interstate commerce cannot be justified by the fact that the ultimate object of the participants was to secure an ulterior benefit which they might have been at liberty to pursue by means not involving such restraint. Anderson v. Shipowners' Association, \n272 \nU.S. 359\n, 47 S. Ct. 125, November 22, 1926; Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 468\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196; Ellis v. Inman, Poulsen & Co. ( C. C. A.) 131 F. 182, 186.\n The case, therefore, is controlled, not by United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., supra, and United Leather Workers v. Herkert, \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S. Ct. 623, 33 A. L. R. 566, as respondents contend, but by others presently to be discussed. In the United Leather Workers Case, it appeared that the strikes \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 48]\n\u00a0\n were leveled only against production, and that the strikers (page 471 (44 S. Ct. 627)) 'did nothing which in any way directly interfered with the interstate transportation or sales of the complainants' product'; and the decision rests upon the ground that there was an entire absence of evidence or circumstances to show that the defendants, in their conspiracy to coerce complainants, were directing their scheme against interstate commerce. United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., supra, pages 408, 409 (42 S. Ct. 570), is to the same effect.\n But, in the second United Mine Workers Case (\n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S. Ct. 551, 556 (69 L. Ed. 963)), this court found sufficient evidence, even where the strike was directed against production, of an intent to restrain interstate commerce, and said:\n'The mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture or production is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce. But when the intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act.'\n\n In the present case, since the strikes were directed against the use of the product in other states, with the immediate purpose and necessary effect of restraining future sales and shipments in interstate commerce, the determinative decisions to be applied are those pointed out in the United Leather Workers Case, at page 469 (44 S. Ct. 626):\n'In Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n (28 S. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815), and in Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 U.S. 443\n (41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196), members of labor unions having a controversy with their employers sought to embarrass the sales by their employers of the product of their manufacture in other states by boycott and otherwise. They were held guilty of a conspiracy against interstate com- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 49]\n\u00a0\n merce because of their palpable intent to achieve their purpose by direct obstruction of that commerce.'\n\n Respondents cite and rely upon Hopkins v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 578\n, 19 S. Ct. 40, and Anderson v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 604\n, 19 S. Ct. 50. But of those cases we need say no more than that they involved agreements which neither in purpose nor in necessary result related to or had any direct effect upon interstate commerce.\n With a few changes in respect of the product involved, dates, names, and incidents, which would have no effect upon the prin ciples established, the opinion in Duplex Co. v. Deering, supra, might serve as an opinion in this case. The object of the boycott there was precisely the same as it is here, and the interferences with interstate commerce, while they were more numerous and more drastic, did not differ in essential character from the interferences here. A short statement of the case will make this clear.\n The complainant was a manufacturer of printing presses, and conducted its business on the 'open shop' policy. There had been an unsuccessful strike to enforce the 'closed shop,' the eight-hour day, and the union scale of wages. The strikers and the local organizations to which they belonged were affiliated with an international asociation having a membership of more than 60,000. They entered into a combination to restrain complainant's interstate trade by means of a 'secondary boycott,' in pursuance of which complainant's customers in another state were warned not to purchase, install, or operate its printing presses and threatened with loss and sympathetic strikes should they do so. The strikers threatened a trucking company with trouble if it should haul the presses, incited employees of the trucking company and other men employed by complainant's customers to strike in order to interfere with the hauling and \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 50]\n\u00a0\n installation of presses, notified repair shops not to do repair work on the presses, threatened union men with loss of union cards and the blacklist if they assisted in installing the presses, and resorted to other methods of preventing the sale and delivery of complainant's presses in interstate commerce.\n This court held that complainant's business of manufacturing presses and disposing of them in commerce was a property right entitled to protection against unlawful injury or interference, that unrestrained access to the channels of interstate commerce was necessary for the successful conduct of that business, and that the combination to hinder and obstruct such commerce by the means indicated was in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, as amended by the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730). The combination was held to constitute a 'secondary boycott,' defined as:\n'A combination not merely to refrain from dealing with complainant, or to advise or by peaceful means persuade complainant's customers to refrain ('primary boycott'), but to exercise coercive pressure upon such customers, actual or prospective, in order to cause them to withhold or withdraw patronage from complainant through fear of loss or damage to themselves should they deal with it.'\n\n Whether either kind of boycott was lawful or unlawful at common law was held to be immaterial, and the distinction between a primary and a secondary boycott was only important to be considered upon the question of the proper construction of the Clayton Act; and, as to that, it was distinctly determined that the Clayton Act was not intended to legalize the secondary boycott.\n The court further held (pages 467, 468 (41 S. Ct. 172)) that by prior decisions of this court it had been settled that a restraint of interstate commerce, produced by peaceable persuasion, was as much within the prohibition of the Anti-Trust Act as one accomplished by force or threats of force, and that there was nothing in section 20 of the Clayton Act, being Comp. St.  1243d (page 473 \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 51]\n\u00a0\n et seq. (41 S. Ct. 172)), which modified that rule as applied to the case under review or justified a resort to the secondary boycott. And it was said (page 477 (41 S. Ct. 172)), that the harmful consequences of the opposite construction, adopted by the court below, were illustrated by that case, where an ordinary controversy in a manufacturing establishment, concerning terms and conditions of employment there, had been held a sufficient occasion for imposing a general embargo upon the products of the establishment and a nation-wide blockade of the channels of interstate commerce against them. The conclusion was reached that complainant was entitled to an injunction under the Sherman Act as amended by the Clayton Act, and that it was unnecessary to consider whether a like result would follow under the common law or local statutes. Finally, it is important to note (page 478 (41 S. Ct. 172)) the scope of the injunction which was authorized. Not only were the association and its members to be restrained from interfering with the sale, transportation, or delivery in interstate commerce of the presses, but also from interfering with-\n the 'carting, installation, use, operation, exhibition, display, or repairing of any such press or presses, ... and especially from using any force, threats, command, direction, or even persuasion with the object or having the effect of causing any person or persons to decline employment, cease employment, or not seek employment, or to refrain from work or cease working under any person, firm, or corporation being a purchaser or prospective purchaser of any printing press or presses from complainant. ...'\n Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, also dealt with a secondary boycott. The case arose before the enactment of the Clayton Act, but, in view of what has just been said, that is not important. The defendants, certain labor organizations and the members thereof, undertook to compel complainants to unionize their factory. Being unsuccessful, the members of the labor organizations withdrew from com- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 52]\n\u00a0\n plainants' service and endeavored to persuade others to do the same. Defendants then declared a boycott against hats manufactured by complainants found in the hands of their customers in other states, with the purpose and intent to destroy or curtail complainants' market in other states and thereby coerce compliance with defendants' demands. This was held (pages 292, 294 (28 S. Ct. 303)) to be a combination falling 'within the class of restraints of trade aimed at compelling third parties and strangers involuntarily not to engage in the course of trade except on conditions that the combination imposes,' and an unlawful restraint of interstate commerce as defined by the Anti-Trust Act. Referring to earlier cases, it was said (page 297 (28 S. Ct. 304)) that the Anti-Trust Act had a broader application than the prohibition of restraints of trade unlawful at common law, and that its effect was to declare illegal 'every contract, combination or conspiracy, in whatever form, of whatever nature, and whoever may be the parties to it, which directly or necessarily operates in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.'\n In United States v. Brims et al., \n272 \nU.S. 549\n, 47 S. Ct. 169 (November 23, 1926), a criminal case, this court dealt with a combination of manufacturers, contractors, and carpenters in Chicago, having for its object the destruction of the competition of nonunion mills in Wisconsin and elsewhere by the employment in Chicago of union carpenters only, with the understanding that they would refuse to install nonunion made millwork. There was evidence tending to show that so-called outside competition was cut down and thereby interstate commerce directly and materially impeded, and that this result was within the intention of the combination, which, upon these facts, was held to be in violation of the Anti-Trust Act.\n In Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 438\n, 439 S., 31 S. Ct. 492, 497 (55 L. Ed. 797, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874), this court said that the restraining powers of the courts extend to every device whereby commerce is ille- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 53]\n\u00a0\n gally restrained; and that-\n'To hold that the restraint of trade under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, or on general principles of law, could be enjoined, but that the means through which the restraint was accomplished could not be enjoined would be to render the law impotent.'\n\n In cases arising outside the Anti-Trust Act, involving strikes like those here under review against so-called unfair products, there is a sharp conflict of opinion. On the one hand, it is said that such a strike is justified on the ground of self-interest; that the injury to the producer is inflicted, not maliciously, but in self-defense; that the refusal of the producer of deal with the union and to observe its standards threatens the interest of all its members and the members of the affiliated locals; and that a strike against the unfair material is a mere recognition of this unity of interest, and in refusing to work on such material the union is only refusing to aid in its own destruction. The opposite view is illustrated by such cases as Toledo, etc., Ry. Co. (C. C.) 62 F. 803, 817, et F. 730, 19 L. R. A. 387; Thomas v. Cincinnati, etc. Ry. Co. (C. C.) 62 F. 803, 817, et seq.; Moores v. Bricklayers' Union, 23 Wkly. Law Bul. (Ohio) 48 (affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio without opinion, 51 Ohio St. 605); Burnham v. Dowd, 217 Mass. 351, 104 N. E. 841, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 778; Purvis v. United Brotherhood, 214 Pa. 348, 63 A. 585, 12 N. R. A. (N. S.) 642, 112 Am. St. Rep. 757, 6 Ann. Cas. 275; Booth & Bro. v. Burgess, 72 N. J. Eq. 181, 188, 196, 65 A. 226; Piano & Organ Workers v. P . & O. Supply Co., 124 Ill. App. 353.\n But with this conflict we have no concern in the present case. The question which it involves was presented and considered in the Duplex Co. Case, supra, as the prevailing and the dissenting opinions show; and there it was plainly held that the point had no bearing upon the enforcement of the Anti-Trust Act, and that, since complainant had a clear right to an injunction under that act as amended by the Clayton Act, it was 'unnecessary to consider whether a like result would follow under the common law or local statutes.'\n\n\n[274 U.S. 37, 54]\n\u00a0\n Whatever may be said as to the motives of the respondents or their general right to combine for the purpose of redressing alleged grievances of their fellow craftsmen or of protecting themselves or their organizations, the present combination deliberately adopted a course of conduct which directly and substantially curtailed, or threatened thus to curtail, the natural flow in interstate commerce of a very large proportion of the building limestone production of the entire country, to the gravely probable disadvantage of producers, purchasers, and the public; and it must be held to be a combination in undue and unreasonable restraint of such commerce within the meaning of the Anti-Trust Act as interpreted by this court. An act which lawfully might be done by one may, when done by many acting in concert, take on the form of a conspiracy and become a public wrong, and may be prohibited if the result be hurtful to the public or to individuals against whom such concerted action is directed (Grenada Lumber Co. v. Mississippi, \n217 \nU.S. 433, 440\n, 30 S. Ct. 535); and any suggestion that such concerted action here may be justified as a necessary defensive measure is completly answered by the words of this court in Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 613\n, 34 S. Ct. 951, 954 (58 L. Ed. 1490, L. R. A. 1915A, 788) that-\n'Congress, with the right to control the field of interstate commerce, has so legislated as to prevent resort to practices which unduly restrain competition or unduly obstruct the free flow of such commerce, and private choice of means must yield to the national authority thus exerted.'\n\n The record does not disclose whether petitioners, at the time of bringing suit, had suffered actual injury; but that is not material. An intent to restrain interstate commerce being shown, it is enough to justify equitable interposition by injunction if there be a dangerous probability that such injury will happen; and this clearly appears. The Anti-Trust Act 'directs itself against that dangerous probability as well as against the completed result.' Swift- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 55]\n\u00a0\n & Co. v. United States, supra, page 396 (25 S. Ct. 279); Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, \n185 \nU.S. 65, 82\n, 22 S. Ct. 585; Thomson Machine Co. v. Brown, 89 N. J. Eq. 326, 328, 104 A. 129.\n From the foregoing review, it is manifest that the acts and conduct of respondents fall within the terms of the Anti-Trust Act; and petitioners are entitled to relief by injunction under section 16 of the Clayton Act, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 737 (Comp. St.  8835o), by which they are authorized to sue for such relief 'against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the anti-trust laws,' etc. The strikes, ordered and carried out with the sole object of preventing the use and installation of petitioners' product in other states, necessarily threatened to destroy or narrow petitioners' interstate trade by taking from them their customers. That the organizations, in general purpose and in and of themselves, were lawful, and that the ultimate result aimed at may not have been illegal in itself, are beside the point. Where the means adopted are unlawful, the innocent general character of the organizations adopting them or the lawfulness of the ultimate end sought to be attained, cannot serve as a justification.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD (concurring).\n I concur in this result upon the controlling authority of Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 478\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196, which, as applied to the ultimate question in this case, I am unable to distinguish.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n As an original proposition, I should have doubted whether the Sherman Act prohibited a labor union from peaceably refusing to work upon material produced by nonunion labor or by a rival union, even though inter- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 56]\n\u00a0\n state commerce were affected. In the light of the policy adopted by Congress in the Clayton Act, with respect to organized labor, and in the light of Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734, and United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 U.S. 106\n, 178-180, 31 S. Ct. 632, I should not have thought that such action as is now complained of was to be regarded as an unreasonable and therefore prohibited restraint of trade. But in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196, these views were rejected by a majority of the court and a decree was authorized restraining in precise terms any agreement not to work or refusal to work, such as is involved here. Whatever additional facts there may have been in that case, the decree enjoined the defendants from using- 'even persuasion with the object or having the effect of causing any person or persons to decline employment, cease employment, or not seek employment, or to refrain from work or cease working under any person, firm, or corporation being a purchaser or prospective purchaser of any printing press or presses from complainant, ....' Page 478 (41 S. Ct. 180).\n These views, which I should not have hesitated to apply here, have now been rejected again largely on the authority of the Duplex Case. For that reason alone, I concur with the majority.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The constitution of the Journeymen Stone Cutters' Association provides:\n'No member of this association shall cut, carve or fit any material that has been cut by men working in opposition to this association.'\n\n For many years, the plaintiffs had contracts with the association under which its members were employed at their several quarries and works. In 1921, the plaintiffs refused to renew the contracts because certain rules or conditions proposed by the journeymen were unacceptable. \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 57]\n\u00a0\n Then came a strike. It was followed by a lockout, the organization by the plaintiffs of a so-called independent union, and the establishment of it at their plants. Repeated efforts to adjust the controversy proved futile. Finally, the association urged its members working on buildings in other states to observe the above provision of its constitution. Its position was:\n'That, if employers will not employ our members in one place, we will decline to work for them in another, or to finish any work that has been started or party completed by men these employers are using to combat our organization.'\n\n The trial court dismissed the bill. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the decree said:\n'After long negotiations and failure to reach a new working agreement, the union officers ordered that none of its members should further cut stone which had already been partly cut by nonunion labor, with the result that on certain jobs in different states stonecutters, who were members of the union, declined to do further cutting upon such stone. Where, as in some cases, there were few or no local stonecutters, except such as belonged to the union, the completion of the buildings was more or less hindered by the order, the manifest object of which was to induce appellants to make a contract with the union for employment of only union stonecutters in the Indiana limestone district. It does not appear that the quarrying of stone, or sawing it into blocks, or the transportation of it, or setting it in the buildings, or any other building operation, was sought to be interfered with, and no actual or threatened violence appears, no picketing, no boycott, and nothing of that character.'\n\n If, in the struggle for existence, individual working men may, under any circumstances, co-operate in this way for self-protection even though the interstate trade of another is thereby restrained, the lower courts were clearly right in denying the injunction sought by plaintiffs. I have \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 58]\n\u00a0\n no occasion to consider whether the restraint, which was applied wholly intrastate, became in its operation a direct restraint upon interstate commerce. For it has long been settled that only unreasonable restraints are prohibited by the Sherman Law. \n1\n Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 58 S., 31 S. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 178\n, 180 S., 31 S. Ct. 632; Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S. Ct. 242; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S. Ct. 377, 71 L. Ed. -, No. 27, decided February 21, 1927. Compare United States v. Terminal Ass'n, \n224 \nU.S. 383\n, 32 S. Ct. 507; United States v. Reading Co., \n226 \nU.S. 324, 369\n, 33 S. Ct. 90. And the restraint imposed was, in my opinion, a reasonable one. The act does not establish the standard of reasonableness. What is reasonable must be determined by the application of principles of the common law, as administered in federal courts, unaffected by state legislation or decision. Compare Duplex Printing Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 466\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196. Tested by these principles, the propreity of the unions' conduct can hardly be doubted by one who believes in the organization of labor\n Neither the individual stonecutters nor the unions had any contract with any of the plaintiffs or with any of their customers. So far as concerned the plaintiffs and their customers, the individual stonecutters were free either to work or to abstain from working on stone which had been cut at the quarries by members of the employers' union. So far as concerned the association, the individual stonecutter was not free. He had agreed, when he became a member, that he would not work on stone 'cut by men working in opposition to' the association. It was in duty bound to urge upon its members observance of the obligation assumed. These cut stone companies, who alone are seeking relief, were its declared \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 59]\n\u00a0\n enemies. They were seeking to destroy it. And the danger was great.\n The plaintiffs are not weak employers opposed by a mighty union. They have large financial resources. Together, they ship 70 per cent. of all the cut stone in the country. combined in a local employers' organization. And their organization is affiliated with the national employers' organization, called 'International Cut Stone & Quarrymen's Association.' Standing alone, each of the 150 journeymen's locals is weak. The average number of members in a local union is only 33. The locals are widely scattered throughout out the country. Strong employers could destroy a local 'by importing scabs' from other cities. And many of the builders by whom the stonecutters were employed in different cities are strong. It is only through combining the 5,000 organized stonecutters in a national union, and developing loyalty to it, that the individual stonecutter anywhere can protect his own job.\n The manner in which these individual stonecutters exercised their asserted right to perform their union duty by refusing to finish stone 'cut by men working in opposition to' the association was confessedly legal. They were innocent alike of trespass and of breach of contract. They did not picket. They refrained from violence, intimidation, fraud, and threats. They refrained from obstructing otherwise either the plaintiffs or their customers in attempts to secure other help. They did not plan a boycott against any of the plaintiffs or against builders who used the plaintiffs' product. On the contrary, they expressed entire willingness to cut and finish anywhere any stone quarried by any of the plaintiffs, except such stone by any of partially 'cut by men working in opposition to' the association. A large part of the plaintiffs' product consisting of blocks, slabs, and sawed work was not \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 60]\n\u00a0\n affected by the order of the union officials. The individual stonecutter was thus clearly innocent of wrongdoing, unless it was illegal for him to agree with his fellow craftsmen to refrain from working on the 'scab' cut stone because it was an article of interstate commerce.\n The manner in which the journeymen's unions acted was also clearly legal. The combination complained of is the co-operation of persons wholly of the same craft, united in a national union, solely for self-protection. No outsider-be he quarrier, dealer, builder, or laborer-was a party to the combination. No purpose was to be subserved except to promote the trade interests of members of the Journeymen's Association. There was no attempt by the unions to boycott the plaintiffs. There was no attempt to seek the aid of members of any other craft, by a sympathetic strike or otherwise. The contest was not a class struggle. It was a struggle between particular employers and their employees. But the controversy out of which it arose related, not to specific grievances, but to fundamental matters of union policy of general application throughout the country. The national association had the duty to determine, so far as its members were concerned, what that policy should be. It deemed the maintenance of that policy a matter of vital interest to each member of the union. The duty rested upon it to enforce its policy by all legitimate means. The association, its locals and officers, were clearly innocent of wrong doing, unless Congress has declared that, for union officials to urge members to refrain from working on stone 'cut by men working in opposition' to it, is necessarily illegal if thereby the interstate trade of another is restrained.\n The contention that earlier decisions of this court compel the conclusion that it is illegal seems to me unfounded. The cases may support the claim that, by such local abstention from work, interstate trade is restrained. But ex- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 61]\n\u00a0\n amination of the facts in those cases makes clear that they have no tendency whatsoever to establish that the restraint imposed by the unions in the case at bar is unreasonable. The difference between the simple refraining from work practiced here, and the conduct held unreasonable in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196, appears from a recital in that opinion of the defendants' acts:\n'The acts embraced the following, with others: Warning customers that it would be better for them not to purchase, or, having purchased, not to install, presses made by complainant, and threatening them with loss should they do so; threatening customers with sympathetic strikes in other trades; notifying a trucking company usually employed by customers to haul the presses not to do so, and threatening it with trouble if it should; inciting employees of the trucking company, and other men employed by customers of complainant, to strike against their respective employers, in order to interfere with the hauling and installation of presses, and thus bring pressure to bear upon the customers; notifying repair shops not to do repair work on Duplex presses; coercing union men by threatening them with loss of union cards and with being black-listed as 'scabs' if they assisted in installing the presses; threatening an exposition company with a strike if it permitted complainant's presses to be exhibited; and resorting to a variety of other modes of preventing the sale of presses of complainant's manufacture in or about New York City, and delivery of them in interstate commerce, such as injuring and threatening to injure complainant's customers and prospective customers, and persons concerned in hauling, handling, or installing the presses.' Pages 463, 464 (41 S. Ct. 175).\n\n The character of the acts held in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering to constitute unreasonable restraint is fur- \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 62]\n\u00a0\n ther shown by the scope of the injunction there prescribed (pages 478, 479 ( 41 S. Ct. 180)):\n'There should be an injunction against defendants and the associations represented by them, and all members of those associations, restraining them, according to the prayer of the bill, from interfering or attempting to interfere with the sale, transportation, or delivery in interstate commerce of any printing press or presses manufactured by complainant, or the transportation, carting, installation, use, operation, exhibition, display, or repairing of any such press or presses, or the performance of any contract or contracts made by complainant respecting the sale, transportation, delivery, or installation of any such press or presses, by causing or threatening to cause loss, damage, trouble, or inconvenience to any person, firm, or corporation concerned in the purchase, transportation, carting, installation, use, operation, exhibition, display, or repairing of any such press or presses, or the performance of any such contract or contracts; and also and especially from using any force, threats, command, direction, or even persuasion with the object or having the effect of causing any person or persons to decline employment, cease employment, or not seek employment, or to refrain from work or cease working under any person, firm or corporation being a purchaser or prospective purchaser of any printing press or presses from complainant, or engaged in hauling, carting, delivering, installing, handling, using, operating, or repairing any such press or presses for any customer of complainant. Other threatened conduct by defendants or the associations they represent, or the members of such associations, in furtherance of the secondary boycott should be included in the injunction according to the proofs.'\n\n The difference between the facts here involved and those in the Duplex Case does not lie only in the character of the acts complained of. It lies also in the occasion and \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 63]\n\u00a0\n purpose of the action taken and in the scope of the combination. The combination there condemned was not, as here, the co-operation for self- protection only of men in a single craft. It was an effort to win by invoking the aid of others, both organized and unorganized, not concerned in the trade dispute. The conduct there condemned was not, as here, a mere refusal to finish particular work begun 'by men working in opposition to' the union. It was the institution of a general boycott, not only of the business of the employer, but of the businesses of all who should participate in the marketing, installation, or exhibition of its product. The conduct there condemned was not, as here, action taken for self- protection against an opposing union installed by employers to destroy the regular union with which they long had had contracts. The action in the Duplex Case was taken in an effort to unionize an open shop. Moreover, there the combination of defendants was aggressive action directed against an isolated employer. Here it is defensive action of working men directed against a combination of employers. The serious question on which the court divided in the Duplex Case was not whether the restraint imposed was reasonable. It was whether the Clayton Act had forbidden federal courts to issue an injunction in that class of cases. See page 464, (41 S. Ct. 172).\n In Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, Gompers v. Buck's Stove Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418\n, 31 S. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874, and Lawlor v. Loewe, \n235 \nU.S. 522\n, 35 S. Ct. 170, the conduct held unreasonable was not, as here, a refusal to finish a product partly made by members of an opposing union. It was invoking the power of the consumer as a weapon of offensive warfare. There, a general boycott was declared of the manufacturer's product. And the boycott was extended to the business of both wholesalers and retailers who might aid in the marketing of the manufacturer's product. Moreover, the boycott was to be effected, not by the co-operation merely of the few members of the craft directly and vitally interested \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 64]\n\u00a0\n in the trade dispute, but by the aid of the vast forces of organized labor affiliated with them through the American Federation of Labor.\n In United States v. Brims, \n272 \nU.S. 549\n, 47 S. Ct. 169, the combination complained of was not the co-operation merely of working men of the same craft. It was a combination of manufacturers of millwork in Chicago with building contractors who cause such work to be installed and the unions whose members are to be employed. Moreover the purpose of the combination was not primarily to further the interests of the union carpenters. The immediate purpose was to suppress competition with the Chicago manufacturers. As this court said:\n'The respondent manufacturers found their business seriously impeded by the competition of material made by nonunion mills located outside of Illinois. ... They wished to eliminate the competition of Wisconsin and other nonunion mills, which were paying lower wages and consequently could undersell them. ... The local manufacturers, relieved from the competition that came through interstate commerce, increased their output and profits; they gave special discounts to local contractors; more union carpenters secured employment in Chicago, and their wages were increased. These were the incentives which brought about the combination.'\n\n In United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762, \n268 U.S. 295\n, United Leather Workers v. Herkert, \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S. Ct. 623, 33 A. L. R. 566, Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64\n, 45 S. Ct. 403, as in Hopkins v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 578\n, 19 S. Ct. 40, Anderson v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 604\n, 19 S. Ct. 50, Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38\n, 24 S. Ct. 307, and Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, the questions put in issue were not the reasonableness of the restraint, but whether the restraint was of interstate commerce.\n Members of the Journeymen Stone Cutters' Association could not work anywhere on stone which has been cut at the quarries by 'men working in opposition' to it, \n\n[274 U.S. 37, 65]\n\u00a0\n without aiding and abetting the enemy. Observance by each member of the provision of their constitution which forbids such action was ensential to his own self-protection. It was demanded of each of loyalty to the organization and to his fellows. If, on the undisputed facts of this case, refusal to work can be enjoined, Congress created by the Sherman Law and the Clayton Act an instrument for imposing restraints upon labor which reminds one of involuntary servitude. The Sherman Law was held in United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S. Ct. 293, 8 A. L. R. 1121, to permit capitalists to combine in a single corporation 50 per cent. of the steel industry of the United States dominating the trade through its vast resources. The Sherman Law was held in United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., \n247 \nU.S. 32\n, 38 S. Ct. 473, to permit capitalists to combine in another corporation practically the whole shoe machinery industry of the country, necessarily giving it a position of dominance over shoe manufacturing in America. It would, indeed, be strange if Congress had by the same act willed to deny to members of a small craft of workingmen the right to cooperate in simply refraining from work, when that course was the only means of self- protection against a combination of militant and powerful employers. I cannot believe that Congress did so.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The contrary view was unsuccessfully contended for by Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting, in Standard Oil Co. v.

McClure Johnson, all of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the petitioner, Beech-Nut Packing Company, a corporation of New York, charging the P. Lorillard Company, a corporation of New Jersey, with infringement of its registered trademark, 'Beech-Nut,' and with unfair competition. The bill also takes the possibly broader ground that 'Beech-Nut,' being plaintiff's trade-mark and part of its corporate name, has become the plaintiff's badge and autograph so far that the public seeing the mark on any package of consumable goods will believe that the article is of the plaintiff's make. The trade-mark was first used on ham and bacon, but gradually has been extended to many other articles so diverse as chewing gum, peanut butter, and ginger ale, but always, the plaintiff says, as a guaranty of excellence, often expressed by it in advertisements, as 'Beech-Nut Quality.' The defendant uses the words 'Beech-Nut' on chewing tobacco and cigarettes and the bill takes the hardly consistent positions, on the one hand that the plaintiff's reputation is hurt \n\n[273 U.S. 629, 631]\n\u00a0\n with its refined female customers by the belief that it would manufacture a cheap chewing tobacco, and on the other hand that it may wish to extend its business into that domain. The bill was dismissed on the merits by the District Court, 299 F. 834, and by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 7 F.(2d) 967. As the principles involved seemed important and as it was urged that the decision was in conflict with decisions in other Circuit Courts of Appeal, such as Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney, 247 F. 407, L. R. A. 1918C, 1039, and Vogue Co. v. Vogue Hat Co. (C. C. A.) 6 F.(2d) 875, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n269 \nU.S. 551\n, 46 S. Ct. 203.\n The plaintiff's trade-mark goes back to before the beginning of this century. The registration specially relied upon was dated December 31, 1912, and states that the plaintiff has adopted the mark for use upon a large number of specified objects, including those that we have mentioned, 'all in Class 46, Foods and ingredients of foods.' The defendant claims the mark 'Beechnut' for tobacco through successive assignments from the Harry Weissinger Tobacco Company, of Louisville, Kentucky, which used it from and after 1897. The plaintiff does not contest the original validity of this mark or suggest any distinction on the ground that it originated in a different State, but says that the right has been lost by abandonment. It appears that brands of tobacco have their rise and fall in popular favor, and that the Beechnut had so declined that in 1910 only twenty-five pounds were sold, and the trade-mark was left dormant until after the dissolution of the American Tobacco Company which then held it. This was in 1911, and the Lorillard Company took over the mark with many others. Then in connection with an effort to get a new brand that would hit the present taste, this mark was picked out, some of the adjuncts were changed, and in 1915 the new tobacco was put upon the market. Nothing had happened in \n\n[273 U.S. 629, 632]\n\u00a0\n the meantime to make the defendant's position worse than if it had acted more promptly and we see no reason to disturb the finding of two courts that the right to use the mark had not been lost. The mere lapse of time was not such that it could be said to have destroyed the right as matter of law. A trade-mark is not only a symbol of an existing good will although it commonly is thought of only as that. Primarily it is a distinguishable token devised or picked out with the intent to appropriate it to a particular class of goods and with the hope that it will come to symbolize good will. Apart from nice and exceptional cases and within the limits of our jurisdiction a trade-mark and a business may start together, and in a qualified sense the mark is property, protected and alienable, although as with other property its outline is shown only by the law of torts, of which the right is a prophetic summary. Therefore the fact that the good will once associated with it has vanished does not end at once the preferential right of the proprietor to try it again upon goods of the same class with improvements that renew the proprietor's hopes.\n It may be true that in a case like the plaintiff's its rights would not be sufficiently protected by an injunction against using the marks upon goods of the same class as those to which the plaintiff now applies it and to which its registration is confined. Upon that we express no opinion. For when it is conceded that whatever its effect the defendant has a right to use 'Beechnut' on tobacco unless the right has been abandoned, that possibility does not matter. Again it may be true that in putting a hyphen between Beech and Nut, framing its label with an oval and substituting a beechnut for a squirrel in the center the defendant was trying to get an advantage from the plaintiff's good will and if challenged at once might have been required to make it even plainer than it was \n\n[273 U.S. 629, 633]\n\u00a0\n made by the word 'Lorillard's' in large letters upon the label that the plaintiff had nothing to do with the goods. But the plaintiff waited until 1921. The Lorillard Company is at least as well known to those who do not despise tobacco as the Beech-Nut Company is to its refined customers and the time and the need for that additional precaution has gone by. If the plaintiff was misled in its reason for thinking that the defendant's right had been kept alive it was right in its belief, and further, the belief had no bearing on the question whether the mark was presented in an unjustifiable form.\n Now that the case has been more fully considered than it could be on the petition for certiorari it seems to us that the facts do not present the nice question upon which the petitioner wished us to pass. Both courts having found for the defendant we see no ground upon which it can be said that they were wrong as matter of law. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. v.

Perovich was convicted in Alaska of murder; the verdict being that he was 'guilty of murder in the first degree and that he suffer death.' On September 15, 1905, he was sentenced to be hanged and the judgment was affirmed by this Court. Perovich v. United States, \n205 \nU.S. 86\n, 27 S. Ct. 456. Respites were granted from time to time, and on June 5, 1909, President Taft executed a document by which he purported to 'commute the sentence of the said Vuco Perovich ... to imprisonment for life in a penitentiary to be designated by the Attorney General of the United States.' Thereupon Perovich was transferred from jail in Alaska to a penitentiary in Washington and some years later to one in Leavenworth, Kansas. In November, 1918, Perovich, reciting that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment, applied for a pardon-and did the same thing again on December 10, 1921. On February 20, 1925, he filed in the District Court for the District of Kansas an application for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his removal from jail to a penitentiary and the order of the President were without his consent and without legal authority. The District Judge adopted this view and thereupon ordered the prisoner to be set at large. (9 F.(2d) 124). We pass over the difficulties in the way of this conclusion and confine ourselves to the questions pro- \n\n[274 U.S. 480, 486]\n\u00a0\n posed. The first is:\n'Did the President have authority to commute the sentence of Perovich from death to life imprisonment?'\n\n Both sides agree that the act of the President was properly styled a commutation of sentence, but the counsel of Perovich urge that when the attempt is to commute a punishment to one of a different sort it cannot be done without the convict's consent. The Solicitor General presented a very persuasive argument that in no case is such consent necessary to an unconditional pardon and that it never had been adjudged necessary before Burdick v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 79\n, 35 S. Ct. 267. He argued that the earlier cases here and in England turned on the necessity that the pardon should be pleaded, but that when it was brought to the judicial knowledge of the Court 'and yet the felon pleads not guilty and waives the pardon, he shall not be hanged.' Jenkins, 129, Third Century, case 62.\n We will not go into history, but we will say a word about the principles of pardons in the law of the United States. A pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed. See Ex parte Grossman, \n267 \nU.S. 87, 120\n, 121 S., 45 S. Ct. 332, 38 A. L. R. 131. Just as the original punishment would be imposed without regard to the prisoner's consent and in the teeth of his will, whether he liked it or not, the public welfare, not his consent determines what shall be done. So far as a pardon legitimately cuts down a penalty it affects the judgment imposing it. No one doubts that a reduction of the term of an imprisonment or the amount of a fine would limit the sentence effectively on the one side and on the other would leave the reduced term or \n\n[274 U.S. 480, 487]\n\u00a0\n fine valid and to be enforced, and that the convict's cansent is not required.\n When we come to the commutation of death to imprisonment for life it is hard to see how consent has any more to do with it than it has in the cases first put. Supposing that Perovich did not accept the change, he could not have got himself hanged against the Executive order. Supposing that he did accept, he could not affect the judgment to be carried out. The considerations that led to the modification had nothing to do with his will. The only question is whether the substituted punishment was authorized by law-here, whether the change is within the scope of the words of the Constitution, article 2,  2:\n'The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.'\n\n We cannot doubt that the power extends to this case. By common understanding imprisonment for life is a less penalty than death. It is treated so in the statute under which Perovich was tried, which provides that 'the jury may qualify their verdict (guilty of murder) by adding thereto 'without capital punishment;' and whenever the jury shall return a verdict qualified as aforesaid the person convicted shall be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for life.'

The opposite answer would permit the President to decide that justice requires the diminution of a term or a fine without consulting the convict, but would deprive him of the power in the most important cases and require him to permit an execution which he had decided ought not to take place unless the change is agreed to by one who on no sound principle ought to have any voice in what the law should do for the welfare of the whole.

J. Robert Sherrod, John J. Hamilton, and Robert N. Miller, all of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia under section 1025(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (chapter 234, 43 Stat. 253, 348; U. S. C. tit. 26,  1258 (26 USCA  1258; Comp. St.  6371 5\/6 r)) to compel the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to respond to a subpoena of the Board of Tax Appeals, issued under section 900(i) of the act (26 USCA  1220 (Comp. St.  6371 5\/6 b)), requiring him to answer interroga- \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n tories, and to furnish information contained in the tax returns of 12 corporations. The Commissioner denied the authority of the board to require a response to the subpoena. A decree upholding the jurisdiction of the board and ordering the Commissioner to obey was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District. 17 F.(2d) 663. The case is hrre on certiorari. \n274 \nU.S. 730\n, 47 S. Ct. 591\n\n\n Respondent corporation returned and paid excess profits taxes for the years 1918, 1919, and 1920. In the final determination of these taxes the Commissioner considered together the returns for all three years. He reduced the 1918 tax, increased the 1919 tax, and found the net balance as a deficiency. In fixing the amount of the tax for 1918, the Commissioner, as requested by the taxpayer in an amended return for that year, made a special assessment under sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918 ( chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1093 (Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 j, 6336 7\/16 k)), but decided that no grounds existed for a special assessment for the year 1919, and so determined the tax for that year, using the ordinary assessment method provided by sections 301, 311, and 312 of the act (Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 aa, 6336 7\/16 e, 6336 7\/16 f).\n The invested capital of the corporation taxed is one of the necessary factors in the computation of the tax under those sections. In evident anticipation that in some cases the Commissioner might find it difficult or impossible to ascertain the invested capital, or that in the disturbed economic conditions left by the war the tax in some cases might be harsh in comparison with others, a special method of assessment for those cases ( enumerated in section 327) was provided by section 328. These sections, printed in the margin,1 authorize the computation of the excess profits tax \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n on the basis of a comparison with the data contained in the tax returns of other corporate taxpayers similarly situated.\n Respondent, on appeal to the Board of Tex Appeals, assailed the determination of the Commissioner on the ground that, although the 1918 tax had been assessed under section 328, the standard of comparison applied was erroneous, and resulted in an excessive assessment, and on the \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n ground that the tax for 1919 should have been assessed under section 328. As to the latter contention it set up that, as the Commissioner had been unable satisfactorily to determine respondent's invested capital for 1917 and 1918, he could not have done so for 1919, and that, since the net income for 1919 was abnormal, its profits tax, if asessed by the ordinary method, would be found excessive compared with the tax assessed on other representative corporations.\n The subpoena called for information concededly relevant to these contentions, and was properly issued, if the Board of Tax Appeals had authority to make the inquiry. The Commissioner denies generally that any determinations made by him under sections 327 and 328 may be appealed, and in any case objects that the appeal as to the year 1918 was not properly taken.\n The appeal was authorized, if at all, by section 900(e) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (chapter 234, 43 Stat. 253, 337; U. S. C. tit. 26,  1216 (26 USCA  1216; Comp. St.  6371 5\/6 b)), under section 274 of that Act (26 USCA  1048-1054; Comp. St.  6336 1\/6 zz(1)). Section 274 permits an appeal by the taxpayer only if 'the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of\n___ acted and capital employed, the amount and rate of war profits or excess profits, and all other relevant facts and circumstances.\n\n\n (b)\n For the purposes of subdivision (a) the ratios between the average tax and the average net income of representative corporations shall be determined by the Commissioner in accordance with regulations prescribed by him with the approval of the Secretary. ...\n\n\n (c)\n The Commissioner shall keep a record of all cases in which the tax is determined in the manner prescribed in subdivision (a), containing the name and address of each taxpayer, the business in which engaged, the amount of invested capital and net income shown by the return, and the amount of invested capital as determined under such subdivision. The Commissioner shall furnish a copy of such record and other detailed information with respect to such cases when required by resolution of either house of Congress, without regard to the restrictions contained in section 257. \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n the tax' which has been returned. 'Deficiency' is defined by section 273, of the act (26 USCA  1047 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/6 zz)) as:\n'(1) The amount by which the tax imposed ... exceeds the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return. ... (2) If no amount is shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return, ... then the amount by which the tax exceeds the amounts previously assessed ... as a deficiency. ...'\n\n It is argued that, although there was a deficiency for 1918 and 1919, as considered together by the Commissioner, the years must be treated separately in determining whether a deficiency existed within the meaning of section 274, for purposes of appeal. So treated, there was no deficiency in the year 1918, since the Commissioner had reduced the amount of the tax returned and paid for that year. This argument was rejected in Appeal of E. J. Barry, 1 B. T. A. 156, and the Commissioner appears formally to have announced his acquiescence in its rejection. Int. Rev. Cum. Bull. IV-2-1.\n We think the question suggested is not properly before us. It was not specifically raised on the record before the board, or either court below, and, so far as appears, was not considered by any of them. We were asked to grant certiorari only to pass upon the question whether the Commissioner's determinations under sections 327 and 328 may be appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. This court sits as a court of review. It is only in exceptional cases, and then only in cases from the federal courts, that questions not pressed or passed upon below are considered here. Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195\n, 47 S. Ct. 566. There are specially cogent reasons why this rule should be adhered to when the question involves a practice of one of the great departments of the government. Hence we do not pass upon this aspect of the case, with respect either to the return or the amended return for 1918, and our decision is without prejudice to the disposition of the question wherever appropriately presented. \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n The Commissioner's objection that as to both years the Board of Tax Appeals is without authority to review his action, is based, not on any limitations to be found in the sections of the act defining the jurisdiction of the board, but upon the peculiar provisions of sections 327 and 328 themselves. These, it is argued, vest in the Commissioner the exercise of a judgment and discretion in their nature not subject to appellate review. It is pointed out that by section 327 assessments in the manner provided in section 328 are premitted 'where the Commissioner is unable to determine' the invested capital of the taxpayer, or where 'the Commissioner is unable satisfactorily to determine' the value of a mixed aggregate of tangible and intangible property paid in as capital, or where the Commissioner 'finds and so declares of record that the tax, if determined without benefit of this section,' would, owing to abnormal conditions work a hardship on the taxpayer. And it is urged that this phraseology evidences an intention to make his decision final, The conclusion is said to be fortified by the confidential nature of the returns of taxpayers with which comparison must be made in order to make the assessment under section 328. Their privileged character is thought to preclude a construction of the appeal statute that would result in giving publicity to tax returns and confidential information so carefully guarded by other provisions of the Revenue Acts.\n But there is no inherent impossibility, or, indeed, serious difficulty in reviewing judicially any determination authorized by sections 327 and 328. The determination is to be made upon prescribed and ascertainable data, and is to conform to standards set up by the statute, all defined with sufficient definiteness and clarity to be susceptible of judicial scrutiny. We cannot assume that it is to be either arbitrary or unrelated to the appropriate data in the Commissioner's office, or that he is more qualified to make it than the board established to review his deci- \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n sions. An examination of the sections creating the board and investing it with power can leave no doubt that they were intended to confer upon it appellate powers which are judicial in character. Not only is it required by section 900(e) to hear and determine appeals taken under section 274, which in terms allows an appeal in every case where a deficiency is found by the Commissioner, but it is empowered to administer oaths, and to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and records. It may investigate anew the issues between the government and the taxpayer, and upon the determination of the appeal it may affirm, set aside, or modify the findings and decision of the Commissioner. In the light of such provisions there is plainly no sufficient ground for reading into section 274, allowing an appeal wherever a deficiency is found by the Commissioner, an exception based on the supposedly sacrosanct character of his determinations under sections 327 and 328.\n But little weight can be given to the suggestion that the board's appellate powers are limited by the section of the act prohibiting the publication by collectors of information gained in the course of their duties. Section 1018, re-enacting section 3167 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. C. tit. 18,  216 (18 USCA  216)). The prohibition is limited to disclosures made 'in any other manner than may be provided by law.' It cannot be deemed to forbid disclosures made in obedience to process lawfully issued in a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding, as has, indeed, been recognized by the Treasury Department itself in Treasury Decision No. 2962, directing that copies of returns may be furnished for the government's use as evidence in court. Neither the statute nor the practice of the department suggests the existence of any governmental policy with respect to the use of the returns as evidence in any way inconsistent with the provisions of the statute authorizing the Board of Tax Appeals to hear appeals and conduct proceedings which are judicial in character. \n\n[275 U.S. 220, 228]\n\u00a0\n As we do not pass upon the question whether the Board of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction of the appeal, except in so far as it is involved in our decision that the determinations of the Commissioner under sections 327 and 328 are subject to review by the board, the decree will be so modified as to be without prejudice to the petitioner's presenting in any appropriate manner to the board or the Supreme Court of the District the questions whether the Board of Tax Appeals had in other respects jurisdiction of the appeal as to the tax for 1918, and, if not, to what extent the information called for by the subpoena is relevant and admissible upon the hearing of the appeal as to the tax for 1919.\n Affirmed, as modified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 327. That in the following cases the tax shall be determined as provided in section 328:\n (a) Where the Commissioner is unable to determine the invested capital as provided in section 326;\n (b) In the case of a foreign corporation;\n (c) Where a mixed aggregate of tangible property and intangible property has been paid in for stock or for stock and bonds and the Commissioner is unable satisfactorily to determine the respective \n values of the several classes of property at the time of payment, or to distinguish the classes of property paid in for stock and for bonds, respectively;\n (d) Where upon application by the corporation the Commissioner finds and so declares of record that the tax if determined without benefit of this section would, owing to abnormal conditions affecting the capital or income of the corporation, work upon the corporation an exceptional hardship evidenced by gross disproportion between the tax computed without benefit of this section and the tax computed by reference to the representative corporations specified in section 328. This subdivision shall not apply to any case (1) in which the tax (computed without benefit of this section) is high merely because the corporation earned within the taxable year a high rate of profit upon a normal invested capital, nor (2) in which 50 per centum or more of the gross income of the corporation for the taxable year (computed under section 233 of title II) consists of gains, profits, commissions, or other income, derived on a cost- plus basis from a government contract or contracts made between April 6, 1971, and November 11, 1918, both dates inclusive.\n Sec. 328.

In the case of a foreign corporation the tax shall be computed without deducting the specific exemption of $3,000 either for the taxpayer or the representative corporations.\n In computing the tax under this section the Commissioner shall compare the taxpayer only with representative corporations whose invested capital can be satisfactorily determined under section 326 and which are, as nearly as may be, similarly circumstanced with respect to gross income, net income, profits per unit of business trans- \n\n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLODGETT v.

Title 28, section 346, U. S. C. It is only necessary to answer the one which follows:\n'Are the provisions of sections 319-324 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 313 (26 USCA  1131-1136 (Comp. St.  6336 4\/5 s-6336 4\/5 x)), unconstitutional in so far as they impose and levy a tax upon transfers of property by gifts inter vivos, not made in contemplation of death, and made prior to June 2, 1924, on which date the act was approved, because the same is a direct tax and unapportioned, or because it takes property without due process, \n\n[275 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n or for public use without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment?'\n\n The Revenue Act approved June 2, 1924, provides:\n'Sec. 319. For the calendar year 1924 and each calendar year thereafter, a tax equal to the sum of the following is hereby imposed upon the transfer by a resident by gift during such calendar year of any property wherever situated, whether made directly or indirectly, and upon the transfer by a nonresident by gift during such calendar year of any property situated within the United States, whether made directly or indirectly: 1 per centum of the amount of the taxable gifts not in excess of $50,000,' etc.\n\n'Sec. 320. If the gift is made in property, the fair market value thereof at the date of the gift shall be considered the amount of the gift. Where property is sold or exchanged for less than a fair consideration in money or money's worth, then the amount by which the fair market value of the property exceeded the consideration received shall, for the purpose of the tax imposed by section 319, be deemed a gift, and shall be included in computing the amount of gifts made during the calendar year.'\n\n Section 321 allows certain deductions: $50,000; donations for charitable purposes, etc.\n Section 322 is unimportant here.\n'Sec. 323. Any person who within the year 1924 or any calendar year thereafter makes any gift or gifts in excess of the deductions allowed by section 321 shall, on or before the 15th day of March, file with the collector a return under oath in duplicate, listing and setting forth therein all gifts and contributions made by him during such calendar year. ...\n\n'Sec. 324. The tax imposed by section 319 shall be paid by the donor on or before the 15th day of March, and shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner and \n\n[275 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n subject, in so far as applicable, to the same provisions of law as the tax imposed by section 301.'\n\n Act of February 26, 1926, 44 Stat. 86, c. 27 (26 USCA  1131):\n'Sec. 324. (a) Section 319 of the Revenue Act of 1924 is amended to read as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 319. For the calendar year 1924 and the calendar year 1925, a tax equal to the sum of the following is hereby imposed upon the transfer by a resident by gift during such calendar year of any property wherever situated, whether made directly or indirectly, and upon the transfer by a nonresident by gift during such calendar year of any property situated within the United States, whether made directly or indirectly: 1 per centum of the amount of the taxable gifts not in excess of $50,000; ....' (Some of the succeeding percentages are less and some are higher than those specified by the act of 1924.)\n\n'(b) Subdivision (a) of this section shall take effect as of June 2, 1924.'\n\n During the calendar year 1924, and prior to June 2, plaintiff, Blodgett, a resident of the United States, transferred by gifts inter vivos, and not in contemplation of death, property valued at more than $ 850,000; after June 2 he made other gifts valued at $6,500. The collector exacted of him the tax prescribed by the act of 1924, as amended, on such transfers, and this suit seeks recovery of the sum so paid. The claim is that the Taxing Act, if applicable in the circumstances stated, conflicts with the Fifth Amendment.\n At the argument here counsel for Blodgett affirmed that all the transfers prior to June 2 were really made during the month of January, and the accuracy of this statement was not questioned. Under the circumstances, we will treat this affirmation as if it were part of the recital of facts by the court below.\n The brief in behalf of the collector sets out the legislative history of the gift tax provisions in the Revenue Act \n\n[275 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n of 1924 and shows that they were not presented for the consideration of Congress prior to February 25 of that year. We must therefore determine whether Congress had power to impose a charge upon the donor because of gifts fully consummated before such provisions came before it. \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710.\n In Nichols v. Coolidge (May 31, 1926) this Court pointed out that a statute purporting to lay a tax may be so arbitrary and capricious that its enforcement would amount to deprivation of property without due process of law within the inhibition of the Fifth Amendment. As to the gifts which Blodgett made during January, 1924, we think the challenged enactment is arbitrary and for that reason invalid. It seems wholly unreasonable that one who, in entire good faith and without the slightest premonition of such consequence, made absolute disposition of his property by gifts should thereafter be required to pay a charge for so doing.\n Determination of the cause does not require us to consider other objections to the statute which have been advanced. And it is unnecessary to express on opinion concerning the validity of the statute as to transfers subsequent to June 2. Here all such gifts were within the exemption granted.\n So far as the Revenue Act of 1924 undertakes to impose a tax because of the gifts made during January, 1924, it is arbitrary and invalid under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n Although research has shown and practice has established the futility of the charge that it was a usurpation when this Court undertook to declare an Act of Congress unconstitutional, I suppose that we all agree that to do \n\n[275 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n so is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform. Upon this among other considerations the rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act. Even to avoid a serious doubt the rule is the same. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 408 S., 29 S. Ct. 527; United States v.

Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 402 S., 36 S. Ct. 658. In a different sphere but embodying the same general attitude as to construction, see United States v. Goelet, \n232 \nU.S. 293, 297\n, 34 S. Ct. 431.\n By  319 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (June 2, 1924, c. 234; 43 Stat. 253, 313) a tax is laid on gifts 'For the calendar year 1924 and each calendar year thereafter.' In the Code the words are 'during any calendar year,' Title 26,  1131. The latter phrase brings out what I should think was obvious without its aid, that the purpose is a general one to indicate the periods to be regarded, as distinguished from fiscal years, not necessarily to run counter to the usual understanding that statutes direct themselves to future not to past transactions. Reynolds v. McArthur, 2 Pet. 417, 434 ,7 L. Ed. 470; Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454; Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238, 251\n, 252 S., 45 S. Ct. 487. If when the statute was passed it had been well recognized that Congress had no power to tax past gifts I think that we should have no trouble in reading the Act as meant to operate only from its date and only to tax gifts thereafter made. If I am right, we should read it in that way now. By  324(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 ( Act February 26, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 86),  319 of the Act of 1924 is amended \n\n[275 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n and the rates of taxation are reduced, and then by (b) it is provided that 'subdivision (a) of this section shall take effect as of June 2, 1924,' the date when the earlier act was passed. A reasonable interpretation is that the reduction and the tax operate alike on gifts after that date. Taking both statutes into account, and the principles of construction to which I have referred, I think it tolerably plain that the Act should be read as referring only to transactions taking place after it was passed, when to disregard the rule 'would be to impose an unexpected liability that if known might have induced those concerned to avoid it and to use their money in other ways.' Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238, 251\n, 252 S., 45 S. Ct. 487, 488 (69 L. Ed. 934).\n On the general question whether there is power to tax gifts I express no opinion now. I agree with the result that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the taxes paid in respect of gifts made before the statute went into effect.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice SANFORD and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOTHWELL v.

The plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are the receivers of the Employers' Mutual Insurance & Service Company, a Maryland corporation. The defendant, Buckbee-Mears Company, a Minnesota corporation, is a printing concern with its plant and only place of business in that state. The action is brought for the amount of an assessment made upon the insured pursuant to a policy for 'strike insurance' issued by the company. The only defense relied upon below, or open here, is that the company (and hence its receivers) cannot maintain a suit in a court of Minnesota because it did not, before writing the policy, company with the provisions of the Minnesota law relating to foreign insurance companies doing business within the state. After proceedings which it is unnecessary to detail, 166 Minn. 285, 207 N. W. 724, the trial court sustained that defense. Compare Seamans v. Christian Bros. Mill Co., 66 Minn. 205, 68 N. W. 1065.

The statutes further require that all persons engaged in the solicitation of applications of insurance shall be licensed, and they declare specifically that it shall be unlawful for any person, \n\n[275 U.S. 274, 276]\n\u00a0\n firm or corporation to solicit or make or aid in the soliciting or making of any contract of insurance not authorized by the laws of the state, and that any person, firm, or corporation not complying with the requirements as to the licensing of agents and solicitors shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. G. S. 1923,  3314, 3348, 3349, 3366\n\n\n It is stipulated that the company did not comply with the requirements of the Minnesota law, and that the contract was effected by the company's sending a representative into the state who solicited the insurance there, by the defendant's filling out in Minnesota one of the blank forms for application distributed by the company's agent there, and by the defendant's then mailing it, together with a check for the first premium, to the company's office in Maryland, upon receipt of which the policy was signed by the company in Maryland and mailed to the defendant.\n The receivers rely upon Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n, 17 S. Ct. 427, and St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n, 43 S. Ct. 125. Their contention is that, since the contract was made in Maryland, it was not subject to the prohibitions of the Minnesota law; that the contract was valid where made, and that, hence, Minnesota may not refuse the aid of its courts for enforcing it. Those cases are not applicable. They hold that a state may not prohibit either a citizen or a resident from making a contract-in other words, doing an act-in another state. The defense here rests upon a wholly different ground. It is that the making of the contract involved, and the performance of the contract required, the doing in Minnesota of acts which its laws prohibited, and that the contract contemplated the company's doing there still other forbidden acts.\n A contract of insurance, although made with a corporation having its office in a state other than that in which the insured resides and in which the interest insured is \n\n[275 U.S. 274, 277]\n\u00a0\n located, is not interstate commerce, New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495\n, 34 S. Ct. 167; National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71, 75\n, 43 S. Ct. 32. Hence, Minnesota had the power to prohibit the Employers' Mutual Company from doing business within the state without first complying with the prescribed conditions, and could refuse the aid of its courts in enforcing a contract which involved violation of its laws. Chattanooga Building & Loan Ass'n v. Denson, \n189 \nU.S. 408\n, 23 S. Ct. 630; Interstate Amusement Co. v. Albert, \n239 \nU.S. 560\n, 36 S. Ct. 168. See also Munday v. Wisconsin Trust Co., \n252 \nU.S. 499\n, 40 S. Ct. 365. The parties had, under the Allgeyer and Cotton Compress Cases, the constitutional right to make in Maryland a contract of insurance despite a prohibition of the Minnesota law. But the company, a foreign corporation, had no constitutional right to solicit the insurance in Minnesota by means of an agent present within that state. For the act of solicitation there the state might have punished the agent, and also the company as principal. Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648\n, 15 S. Ct. 207; Nutting v. Massachusetts, \n183 \nU.S. 553\n, 22 S. Ct. 238. Compare Commonwealth v. Nutting, 175 Mass. 154, 55 N. E. 895, 78 Am. St. Rep. 483. As the contract was not a later independent act, but grew immediately out of the illegal solicitation, and was a part of the same transaction, being inseparably tied to it by the use of the application blank illegally distributed, the contract was tainted with the illegality. Armstrong v. Toler, 11 Wheat. 258. Because of such taint the state, under rules of general application, would have had the right to refuse to enforce it, although made in Maryland, even if it had been wholly unobjectionable in its provisions. Compare Delamater v. South Dakota, \n205 U.S. 93\n, 97-103, 27 S. Ct. 447, 10 Ann. Cas. 733; American Fire Insurance Co. v. King Lumber Co., \n250 \nU.S. 2, 11\n, 12 S., 39 S. Ct. 431.\n But the contract was also in its terms obnoxious to the Minnesota law. It required the company to perform in Minnesota, acts which it was prohibited from doing there. \n\n[275 U.S. 274, 278]\n\u00a0\n The company agreed to defend, on behalf of the insured, any suits or other legal proceedings brought by striking employees against the insured to enfore claims arising out of any strike, and to pay any expenses incurred by the company in so doing. This covenant necessarily involved performance in Minnesota, as suits against the insured would be brought in that state, among other reasons, because it was a Minnesota corporation and had no place of business elsewhere. The company also covenanted to indemnify the insured for 'direct loss of average daily net profits and fixed charges' due to strikes. The contract did not specify the place where payment for the loss should be made, so that under the common rule the insurer would be required to make the payment in Minnesota, the domicile of the insured. Pennsylvania Lumbermen's Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Meyer, \n197 \nU.S. 407, 416\n, 25 S. Ct. 483.\n Besides these acts which the company bound itself to perform in Minnesota, the contract reserved to it the right to do, in Minnesota, and the company contemplated doing there, other acts forbidden by its laws, namely, the right to inspect the plant and the books of account and papers of the business, and the right to interrogate persons connected with it. Moreover, the contract clearly contemplates that not only these examinations, but the appraisals and that acts provided to be done by the company in the course of the adjustment of losses, shall be done in Minnesota. All these things were activities of the insurance business which the company was prohibited by valid statutes from doing within the state. Pennsylvania Lumbermen's Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Meyer, supra, pages 414, 415 (25 S. Ct. 485). Compare Commercial Mutual Accident Co. v. Davis, \n213 \nU.S. 245, 256\n, 29 S. Ct. 445. Under rules of law generally applicable a state may refuse to enforce a contract which provides for doing within it an act prohibited by its laws. Compare The Kensington, \n183 \nU.S. 263, 269\n, 22 S. Ct. 102; Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 37 S. Ct. 366; Union \n\n[275 U.S. 274, 279]\n\u00a0\n Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412, 416\n, 38 S. Ct. 147; Grell v. Levy, 16 C. B. (N. S.) 73.\n It is suggested that under a Maryland statute the petitioners are not mere equity receivers, but quasi assignees, and that this places them on a different footing from that which the insurance company would have occupied, if the suit had been brought by it. In support of this contention, the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, and cases such as Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292, are invoked. But the Maryland statute was not set up in the state courts, and, as they did not take judicial notice of it, it will not be noticed here. Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 \nU.S. 1\n, 6 S. Ct. 242; Gasquet v. Lapeyre, \n242 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 37 S. Ct. 165.

NEW YORK & ALBANY LIGHTERAGE CO.(1927)\nNo. 366\nArgued: January 5, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles T. Hendler, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In No. 366, respondent, March 26, 1918, filed its return of income and excess profits taxes for 1917 and paid the amount shown due. Shortly before the expiration of five years after the return the commissioner assessed and the collector demanded payment of additional income and excess profits taxes. Respondent refused to pay. More than five years after the return the collector distrained and sold personal property of the respondent to pay the amount claimed.\n In No. 367, respondent, February 28, 1917, filed his return of income taxes for 1916 and paid the amount shown due. Later an additional tax was assessed, and, more than five years after the return, the collector sought to enforce payment by distraint. Respondent brought suit to restrain the collection on the ground that it was barred by the limit fixed by section 250(d), Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227, 265, c. 136 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 tt)), and that respondent had no adequate remedy at law. The district court denied \n\n[273 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n relief and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Seaman v. Bowers, 297 F. 371. The latter expressed the view that distraint was barred, and held that respondent had an adequate remedy at law. Later the collector enforced payment by distraint.\n In No. 368, respondent, February 27, 1917, filed his income tax return for 1916 and paid the amount shown due. The commissioner, February 27, 1922, assessed an additional income tax. In 1924 the collector enforced payment by distraint.\n Each respondent sued in the southern district of New York to recover the amount so collected. Judgments for respondents were affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 10 F.(2d) 1017. Writs of certiorari were granted. \n271 \nU.S. 658, 659\n, 46 S. Ct. 634\n\n\n The question for decision is this: Where, under the tax laws enacted prior to the Revenue Act of 1921, income and excess profits taxes were assessed within five years after filing return, does section 250(d) of that act bar collection by distraint proceedings begun after the expiration of the five-year period?\n The part of the subdivision that has a bearing is printed in the margin. \n1\n The clause in controversy is:\n'No suit \n\n[273 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes ... shall be begun, after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was filed.'\n\n Petitioner insists that the word 'proceeding' refers only to a proceeding in court and means the same as 'suit,' and that the act prescribes no limitation against the collection of such taxes by distraint.\n There are two methods to compel payment. One is suit, a judicial proceeding; the other is distraint, an executive proceeding. The word 'proceeding' is aptly and commonly used to comprehend steps taken in pursuit of either. There is nothing in the language or context that indicates an intention to restrict its meaning, or to use 'suit' and 'proceeding' synonymously.\n The purpose of the enactment was so fix a time beyond which steps to enforce collection might not be initiated. The repose intended would not be attained if suits only were barred, leaving the collector free at any time to proceed by distraint. In fact distraint is much more frequently resorted to than is suit for the collection of taxes. The mischiefs to be remedied by setting a time limit against distraint are the same as those eliminated by bar against suit. Under petitioner's construction taxpayers having no property within reach of the collector would be protected against stale demands, while others would be liable to have their property distrained and sold to pay like claims. The result tends strongly to discredit petitioner's contention.\n He maintains that any ambiguity in the clause under consideration must be resolved in his favor. Undoubtedly the United States will not be held barred by a general statute of limitation unless, upon a strict construction in its favor, the United States and the claim sought to be enforced fairly may be held to be within the terms and purpose of the statute. Dupont De Nemours & Co. v. Davis, 264, U. S. 456, 462, 44 S. Ct. 364. That rule rests upon \n\n[273 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n the general principle of policy applicable to all governments that the public interest should not be prejudiced by the default or negligence of public officers. United States v. St. Paul, M. & M. Ry. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 310, 314\n, 38 S. Ct. 525. The limitation applies to petitioner and to the claims. It applies to suit; the only question is whether it also bars distraint. The provision is a part of a taxing statute; and such laws are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the taxpayers. Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 \nU.S. 578, 583\n, 22 S. Ct. 515; Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 536\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454. There has been suggested no principle of public policy or other consideration that furnishes any reasonable support for the setting of a limitation against only one of the two authorized methods of enforcing collection.\n The provision is to be applied in harmony with the intention reasonably to be inferred from its terms and the circumstances of its enactment. Cf. United States v. Oregon Lumber Co., \n260 \nU.S. 290, 299\n, 43 S. Ct. 100. Prior to the Revenue Act of 1918 there was no limitation against suit to collect income taxes. Section 250(d) of that act (40 Stat. 1083 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 tt)) required assessment within five years after return, and prohibited the commencement of suit or proceeding to collect such taxes after that period. This bar was held to apply only in respect of taxes for 1918 and later years. Then section 250( d) of the act of 1921 made the limitation apply against collection of taxes under all the earlier acts, and, in pursuance of a legislative purpose to require more prompt action upon the part of the Commissioner an collectors, prescribed the five-year period for determination and assessment of taxes under earlier acts but allowed only four years as to those for 1921 and succeeding years. The same purpose is shown by the requirement that the commissioner, within one year after request by their personal representatives, shall make assessments on income received by deceased persons. These stricter limitations applicable to taxes for the later \n\n[273 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n period make against the petitioner's contention that the act sets no bar against collection by distraint. A reasonable view of the matter is that it was the intention of Congress by the clause here in question to protect taxpayers against any proceeding whatsoever for the collection of tax claims not made and pressed within five years.\n Petitioner's construction of the limitation is inconsistent with the provision immediately preceding it. 'The amount of any such taxes due under any return ... shall be determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax.' If collection by distraint were not barred by section 250(d) it would not be necessary to have this general consent of taxpayers that collection, as well as determination and assessment, might be made after the lapse of the prescribed period.\n Later legislation assumes that the limitation under consideration applies to distraints as well as to suits. See section 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 300 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/6 zz(5 )). Section 278(d) provides that, where assessment is made within the prescribed time, the tax may be collected by distraint or by a proceeding in court within six years after the assessment. And section 278(e) provides:\n'This section shall not authorize the assessment of a tax or the collection thereof by distraint or by a proceeding in court if at the time of the enactment of this act such assessment, distraint, or proceeding was barred by the period of limitation then in existence.'\n\n This plainly implies that distraint might be barred. And the limitation prescribed by section 250(d) is the only one that could have that effect. See also section 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 59.\n The word 'proceedings' is rightly used as descriptive of steps taken for the distraint and sale of property to enforce payment of taxes. See Parker v. Rule's Lessee, \n\n[273 U.S. 346, 352]\n\u00a0\n 9 Cranch, 64, 70; Den ex dem. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272; Sheridan v. Allen (C. C. A.) 153 F. 568. Cf. Scottish Union & Nat. Ins. Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611, 632\n, 633 S., 25 S. Ct. 345; Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 66\n, 26 S. Ct. 370. In a later part, subdivision (g) of section 250, 'proceedings' is used broadly in reference to steps for the collection of taxes. Obviously its meaning is not there limited to collection by suit. And in other parts of the internal revenue laws, enacted before this controversy arose, that word is used as descriptive of steps taken to distrain and sell personal property and to seize and sell real estate for the collection of taxes. See R. S.  3194, 3199, 3200, 3203, (Comp. St.  5916, 5921, 5922, 5925), side notes to  3190 and 3197 ( 5912, 5919).2 Section 250(d) of the act of 1921 and these sections of the Revised Statutes relate to the same subject and are to be construed together.\n It is clear that the meaning of 'proceeding' as used in the clause of limitation in section 250(d), Revenue Act of 1921, cannot be restricted to steps taken in a suit; it includes as well steps taken for the collection of taxes by distraint.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The amount of income, excess profits, or war profits taxes due under any return made under this act for the taxable year 1921 or succeeding taxable years shall be determined and assessed by the commissioner within four years after the return was filed, and the amount of any such taxes due under any return made under this act for prior taxable years or under prior income, excess profits, or war profits tax acts ... shall be determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax; and no suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes due under this act or under prior income, excess profits, or war profits tax acts ... shall be begun, after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was filed, but this shall not affect suits or proceedings begun at the time of the passage of this act. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By section 2, c. 140, Act of June 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 74, the commissioners appointed to revise the laws of the United Stated were directed to arrange 'side notes so drawn as to point to the contents of the text.'

BELL(1927)\nNo. 292\nArgued: April 22, 1927Decided: May 2, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n Mr. I. P. Whitehead, of Lynchburg, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. E. Strode, of Lynchburg, Va., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 200, 205]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of Virginia, affirming a judgment of the Circuit Court of Amherst County, by which the defendant in error, the superintendent of the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded, was ordered to perform the operation of salpingectomy upon Carrie Buck, the plaintiff in error, for the purpose of making her sterile. 143 Va. 310, 130 S. E. 516. The case comes here upon the contention that the statute authorizing the judgment is void under the Fourteenth Amendment as denying to the plaintiff in error due process of law and the equal protection of the laws.\n Carrie Buck is a feeble-minded white woman who was committed to the State Colony above mentioned in due form. She is the daughter of a feeble- minded mother in the same institution, and the mother of an illegitimate feeble-minded child. She was eighteen years old at the time of the trial of her case in the Circuit Court in the latter part of 1924. An Act of Virginia approved March 20, 1924 (Laws 1924, c. 394) recites that the health of the patient and the welfare of society may be promoted in certain cases by the sterilization of mental defectives, under careful safeguard, etc.; that the sterilization may be effected in males by vasectomy and in females by salpingectomy, without serious pain or substantial danger to life; that the Commonwealth is supporting in various institutions many defective persons who if now discharged would become \n\n[274 U.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n a menace but if incapable of procreating might be discharged with safety and become self-supporting with benefit to themselves and to society; and that experience has shown that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of insanity, imbecility, etc. The statute then enacts that whenever the superintendent of certain institutions including the abovenamed State Colony shall be of opinion that it is for the best interest of the patients and of society that an inmate under his care should be sexually sterilized, he may have the operation performed upon any patient afflicted with hereditary forms of insanity, imbecility, etc., on complying with the very careful provisions by which the act protects the patients from possible abuse.\n The superintendent first presents a petition to the special board of directors of his hospital or colony, stating the facts and the grounds for his opinion, verified by affidavit. Notice of the petition and of the time and place of the hearing in the institution is to be served upon the inmate, and also upon his guardian, and if there is no guardian the superintendent is to apply to the Circuit Court of the County to appoint one. If the inmate is a minor notice also is to be given to his parents, if any, with a copy of the petition. The board is to see to it that the inmate may attend the hearings if desired by him or his guardian. The evidence is all to be reduced to writing, and after the board has made its order for or against the operation, the superintendent, or the inmate, or his guardian, may appeal to the Circuit Court of the County. The Circuit Court may consider the record of the board and the evidence before it and such other admissible evidence as may be offered, and may affirm, revise, or reverse the order of the board and enter such order as it deems just. Finally any party may apply to the Supreme Court of Appeals, which, if it grants the appeal, is to hear the case upon the record of the trial \n\n[274 U.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n in the Circuit Court and may enter such order as it thinks the Circuit Court should have entered. There can be no doubt that so far as procedure is concerned the rights of the patient are most carefully considered, and as every step in this case was taken in scrupulous compliance with the statute and after months of observation, there is no doubt that in that respect the plaintiff in error has had due process at law.\n The attack is not upon the procedure but upon the substantive law. It seems to be contended that in no circumstances could such an order be justified. It certainly is contended that the order cannot be justified upon the existing grounds. The judgment finds the facts that have been recited and that Carrie Buck 'is the probable potential parent of socially inadequate offspring, likewise afflicted, that she may be sexually sterilized without detriment to her general health and that her welfare and that of society will be promoted by her sterilization,' and thereupon makes the order. In view of the general declarations of the Legislature and the specific findings of the Court obviously we cannot say as matter of law that the grounds do not exist, and if they exist they justify the result. We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11\n, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765. Three generations of imbeciles are enough. \n\n[274 U.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n But, it is said, however it might be if this reasoning were applied generally, it fails when it is confined to the small number who are in the institutions named and is not applied to the multitudes outside. It is the usual last resort of constitutional arguments to point out shortcomings of this sort. But the answer is that the law does all that is needed when it does all that it can, indicates a policy, applies it to all within the lines, and seeks to bring within the lines all similary situated so far and so fast as its means allow. Of course so far as the operations enable those who otherwise must be kept confined to be returned to the world, and thus open the asylum to others, the equality aimed at will be more nearly reached.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER dissents. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNRITE COAL BRIQUETTE CO. v.

J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Merritt Lane, of Newark, N. J., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for New Jersey against the Burnrite Coal Briquette Company, a Delaware corporation, by Riggs, a stockholder. The bill charged gross mismanagement; prayed for the appointment of a receiver to conserve the assets; and asked, that 'if deemed advisable' the court 'proceed under the statutes of the state of New Jersey ... and that the \n\n[274 U.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n receiver be given all the powers and be charged with all the duties imposed upon such a receiver by the statutes.' Upon the filing of the bill, receivers were appointed, action by the corporation was enjoined, and an issue of receivers' certificates was authorized, all ex parte. After an elaborate hearing upon an order to show cause, the receivers were continued until final hearing. Upon final hearing, the charges of mismanagement were sustained and the receivership was again ordered continued-\n'with all the powers vested in them by previous orders by this court made, and with all of the powers conferred upon receivers by an act of the state of New Jersey, entitled 'An act concerning corporations,' revision of 1896, its amendments and supplements thereto, and that the receivers continue to operate the business of said defendant corporation upon a reorganization or readjustment of the affairs of said corporation or such disposition as may be hereafter directed to be made of the affairs of said corporation by this court.'\n\n The Court of Appeals reversed the decree entered upon the final hearing and directed that the bill be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The decision was not rested upon the ground that a state cannot enlarge the remedial right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity, see Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491\n, 43 S. Ct. 454; nor upon the ground that a state cannot modify the substantive rights of a stockholder as against a foreign corporation merely because it happens to have property within the state. Compare Maguire v. Mortgage Co. (C. C. A.) 203 F. 858. The reversal was placed solely upon the ground that the corporation had been found by the District Court solvent at the time of the filing of the bill; that the statute of New Jersey, as interpreted by its courts, conferred no power upon its own courts to appoint receivers of foreign corporations unless they were insolvent; and that the juris- \n\n[274 U.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n diction of the federal court was determined by that of the state courts. ( C. C. A.) 291 F. 754.\n After the coming down of the mandate, directing dismissal for want of jurisdiction, the District Court allowed the account of the receivers who had been active during a period of nearly two years; directed payment by the corporation of the receivers' obligations then outstanding, their expenses, the costs, and compensation for their own services and those of their counsel, amounting in all to nearly $80,000; declared these amounts a lien upon the corporation's property; and ordered that, in default of payment, the property be sold to satisfy the charges. Upon a second appeal, that decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 6 F.(2d) 226. The corporation contended that since the District Court was held to be without jurisdiction, it had no power to allow the account and order the payment out of the fund. Lion Bonding and Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 640, 642\n, 43 S. Ct. 641. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 547\n, 46 S. Ct. 106.\n The main question for decision is whether, in view of the Court of Appeals' direction to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction, it was error to allow thereafter the receivers' account and direct the payment. There was an objection to the jurisdiction, which, if it had been seasonably taken, must have prevailed. Camp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308\n, 39 S. Ct. 478. The plaintiff was a citizen of New York; the defendant a Delaware corporation; the federal jurisdiction rested wholly on diversity of citizenship; and neither party was a citizen of New Jersey. Thus there was a sound objection to the venue. If that objection had been duly made, and had been insisted upon, an error of the lower court in overruling it could not justify charging the corporation now with payment of any charge on account of the receivership. But that objection to the jurisdiction, being to the venue, could be waived. \n\n[274 U.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n Central Trust Co. v. McGeorge, \n151 \nU.S. 129\n, 14 S. Ct. 286; Kreigh v. Westinghouse & Co., \n214 \nU.S. 249, 252\n, 253 S., 29 S. Ct. 619. And, before it was taken by the answer, it had been waived by a general appearance and other action. This was conceded.\n The reversal with direction to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, ordered on the first appeal, was put upon an entirely different ground. The Court of Appeals held that there was lack of jurisdiction of the subjectmatter. It assumed that the jurisdiction of the federal court was dependent upon the state statute. This was error. A federal district court may, under its general equity powers independently of any state statute, entertain a bill of a stockholder against the corporation for the appointment of at least a temporary receiver in order to prevent threatened diversion or loss of assets through gross fraud and mismanagement of its officers. \n1\n There were allegations in the bill adequate to support a suit of that character; and there was nothing in the bill inconsistent with its being entertained as such. The only reference in the bill to the state statute was in one of its eleven prayers. After the waiver of the objection to the venue, there was federal jurisdiction over the parties and of the subject-matter; and there was equity jurisdiction.\n The fact that a bill seeking appointment of a receiver of a corporation is brought in a state other than that of the incorporation may lead the court to decline to interfere as a matter of comity or for want of equity; or it may require the court to limit the scope of the relief \n\n[274 U.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n granted. \n2\n But the fact of incorporation under the laws of another state does not preclude jurisdiction. \n3\n If the dismissal directed by the Court of Appeals on the first appeal was proper (as to which we have no occasion to express an opinion), it must be justified on the ground that, in view of the facts, the District Court erred in its judgment in appointing and continuing the receivers. Compare Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. Newman (C. C. A.) 187 F. 573, 576. In other words, the dismissal must rest on the ground that there was want of equity, not on lack of jurisdiction.\n The District Court, assuming erroneously that it was without jurisdiction of the cause, based the order of payment solely on a supposed exception to the rule which denies to a court lacking jurisdiction the power to allow receivers' charges. According to the supposed exception, a party who has acquiesced and has thereby joined in misleading the court into an erroneous exercise of jurisdiction, may not complain when he is, thereafter, saddled with the charges. And he will be held to have acquiesced, despite a challenge of the jurisdiction, if his challenge was placed wholly upon an untenable ground; for, by objecting only on the untenable ground, he may have misled the court as much as if he had not objected at all. The trial court rested its finding of acquiescence on the fact that, while vigorously opposing continuance of the receiver- \n\n[274 U.S. 208, 214]\n\u00a0\n ship on other grounds, the corporation did not intimate a lack of jurisdiction until months after the appointment; that, aside from failing to object to the venue, it failed to appeal from the decree continuing the appointment of the receivers, when the case was heard upon the order to show cause; and that it stood by in silence while the receivers were borrowing and spending money upon its property, thus taking the benefit of their action. The assumption of the District Court in matter of law and its finding of fact were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n We have no occasion to determine whether a federal district court which appoints a receiver in a case in which it necessarily lacks jurisdiction of the subject-matter, so that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by acquiescence, may nevertheless impose upon the corporation, because of acquiescence, the usual charges incident to a receivership. For in the case at bar, the District Court had throughout jurisdiction of the subject-matter. It is settled that where a receiver is appointed in a stockholders' suit by a federal court having jurisdiction, and the appointment is held on review to have been wrongly made, the court may, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, require that the receivers' charges be paid either by the corporation or by the unsuccessful plaintiff. 4 See Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118, 132\n, 29 S. Ct. 230; Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 640, 642\n, 43 S. Ct. 641. Compare Atlantic Trust Co. v. Chapman, \n208 \nU.S. 360\n, 28 S. Ct. 406. And where a court, in the exercise of jurisdiction, has erroneously appointed a receiver, the acquiescence of the defendant may influence the court, in its discretion, to make the receivership expenses a charge \n\n[274 U.S. 208, 215]\n\u00a0\n upon the fund. \n5\n It was well within the discretion of the District Court to charge the fund in the case at bar.\n We have no occasion to consider the contention, made as to a part of the charges, that they were incurred after the acquiescence had ceased and, hence, do not fall within the supposed exception above referred to. For the waiver of the objection to venue conferred upon the District Court complete jurisdiction of the cause, and the power to impose upon the corporation payment of the receivers' charges does not rest on acquiescence. There is no serious contention that any particular charge allowed was, in its nature or in amount, improper, or that in allowing it as a charge against the fund there was an abuse of discretion.\n The contention that the first decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals directing dismissal of the bill for want of jurisdiction had become 'the law of the case' and that, therefore, this court must assume that the dismissal of the bill directed was properly a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, is groundless.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 135\nArgued: November 24, 1926Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 328, 329]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. W. Henderson, of Bakersfield, Cal., and Walter H. Pollak, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An Act of Congress of June 2, 1920,  4, c. 218, 41 Stat. 731 (Comp. St.  5207d), provides that, if any offense shall be committed in the Yosemite National Park which is not prohibited by a law of the United States, the offender shall be subject to the same punishment as the laws of California prescribe for a like offense. Plaintiff in error was indicted for violating within that park the California Criminal Syndicalism Act (chapter 188, California Statutes 1919). The indictment was in two counts. The verdict was guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second. Plaintiff in error, by demurrer and by motion to arrest the judgment, insisted that the statute contravenes the Constitution of the United States. His contention was overruled. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) before the amendment of February 13, 1925\n\n\n The applicable provisions follow:\n'Section 1. The term 'criminal syndicalism' as used in this act is hereby defined as any doctrine or precept advocating, teaching, or aiding and abetting the commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby defined as meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property), or unlawful acts of force and violence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any political change.\n\n'Sec. 2. Any person who ... organizes or assists in organizing, or is or knowingly becomes a member of, any organization, society, group or assemblage of persons organized or assembled to advocate, teach, or aid and abet criminal syndicalism, ... is guilty of a felony . ...'\n\n Plaintiff in error here contends that, as applied in the district court, these provisions are repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The only attack upon the validity of the law was by the demurrer and motion in arrest. In each \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n of these, he asserted that the statute 'is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and is void for uncertainty.' But that point is determined adversely to his contentions in Whitney v. People of the State of California, \n274 \nU.S. 357\n, 47 S. Ct. 641, decided this day.\n The substance of the count on which plaintiff in error was adjudged guilty is that on or about April 10, 1923, at Yosemite National Park, he did 'organize, and assist in organizing, and was, is, and knowingle become a member of an organization, society, group and assemblage of persons organized and assembled to advocate, teach, aid and abet criminal syndicalism, to wit, the Industrial Workers of the World, commonly known as I. W. W.'\n\n 1. \nPlaintiff in error argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the charge contains the following:\n'Now, there has been presented to you evidence ... to the effect that this organization, amongst other things, advocated what is known as slowing down on the job, slack or scamped work, such as loading of a ship in such a way that it took a list to port or starboard and therefore had to limp back to port, and things of that kind. I instruct you that under the definition as laid down by the Legislature of California that any deliberate attempt to reduce the profits in the manner that I have described would constitute sabotage.'\n\n He calls attention to the language in section 1 and says the merely loading telephone poles on a ship so as to occasion more work is not physical damage or injury to physical property within the meaning of the statute.\n If that instruction stood alone it might be thought to permit the jury erroneously to expand the meaning of sabotage beyond that defined in the act. But it does not stand alone; and the mere comparison of the quoted language of the instruction with the words of the statute is not sufficient to disclose whether there was prejudicial error. The instruction must be taken in connection with \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n the evidence bearing on the matter referred to and is to be considered in the light of the charge as a whole. New York Cent. & H. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 509, 508\n, 29 S. Ct. 309; Hotema v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 413, 416\n, 22 S. Ct. 895; C. M. Spring Drug Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 852, 856; People v. Scott, 6 Mich. 287, 291. There is no contention that plaintiff in error was not connected with the organization substantially as alleged, or that the evidence failed to show it to be the kind of organization specified in the indictment. The record shows that for a number of years he had been a member of the organization; that, at the time alleged and when arrested, he was its authorized delegate and had a quantity of its literature in his possession: that he solicited others to become members and was authorized to initiate new members and to collect initiation fees and dues. It also shows that the organization disseminated large amounts of printed matter declaring its purposes and advocating means to accomplish them. A 'preamble' was contained in practically all its publications and was printed on the membership card of plaintiff in error. It declares that the working class and employing class have nothing in common; that a struggle must go on between them until the workers organize, take possession of the earth and the machinery of production and abolish the wage system; that the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that they have interests in common with their employers; that, 'instead of the conservative motto, 'A fair day's wages for a fair day's work,' we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, 'Abolition of the wage system;\" that it is the mission of the working class to do away with capitalism; that the army of production must be organized to carry on when capitalism shall have been overthrown; that 'by organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.' \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n Sabotage, as the evidence indicates it to have been advocated and taught by the organization, is not confined, as is the definition contained in the act, to physical damage and injury to physical property. The organization's printed matter that was received in evidence contains no precise definition of sabotage, but does give a number of descriptive explanations of what it means. As fairly illustrative, we take the following:\n'Three versions are given of the source of the word. The one best known is that a striking French weaver cast his wooden shoe-called a sabot-into the delicate mechanism of the loom upon leaving the mill. The confusion that resulted, acting to the workers' benefit, brought to the front a line of tactics that took the name of sabotage. Slow work is also said to be at the basis of the words, the idea being that wooden shoes are clumsy and so prevent quick action on the part of the workers. The third idea is that sabotage is coined from the slang term that means 'putting the boots' to the employers by striking directly at their profits without leaving the job. The derivation, however, is unimportant. It is the thing itself that causes commotion among employers and politicians alike.'\n\n The evidence shows that the organization advocated, taught and aided various acts of 'sabotage' that are plainly within the meaning of that word as defined by the act. Some examples are: Injuring machinery when employed to use it, putting emery dust in lubricating oil, damaging materials when using them in manufacture or otherwise, scattering foul seed in fields, driving tacks and nails in grape vines and fruit trees to kill them, using acid to destroy guy wires holding up the poles provided to support growing vines, putting pieces of wire and the like among vines to destroy machines used to gather crops, scattering matches and using chemicals to start fires to destroy property of employers. One of the witnesses testified:\n'I heard ... a member of the I. W. W. say in \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n a speech on May 10, 1923: 'When you go back to work, if we do have to go to work, we will put on the wooden shoe.' Then he said: 'In case you are loading telephone poles on a ship down there, sometime the boss is not looking you can slip a couple of poles crossways and then cover up, and then when that ship goes to sea naturally she will start rolling and the cargo will shift, and then she will come in listed like the one you see out in the harbor, then she has got to tie up to the dock, and she will have to unload the telephone poles and put them in again and put them straight, and then we will get paid for the loading originally, and get paid for unloading it and get pay for loading it again, and that will hit the bosses hard in the pocketbook.\"\n\n The foregoing sufficiently shows the foundation of fact for the portion of the charge complained of. Before giving that instruction, the court warned the jury that the government must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the I. W. W. was such an organization as is denounced by the act. The definition of criminal syndicalism was given the jury in the exact words of the statute. The court then gave a number of lexicographers' definitions of sabotage. They are broader than the meaning of the word as defined in the act and are not confined to physical damage or injury to physical property. Then, by way of contrast, the statutory definition of sabotage was repeated, and by the repetition it was emphasized. The court said:\n'The statute itself, you will notice, however, denounces sabotage as meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property.'\n\n The instruction complained of followed. It referred to the evidence indicating that the organization advocated acts such as loading a ship so that it would list and have to return, and things of that kind. And in that connection the court said that any deliberate attempt to reduce profits 'in the manner that I have described' would \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 335]\n\u00a0\n constitute sabotage. The language excepted to was followed by an instruction containing this:\n'If you find, therefore, that this organization advocated sabotage, or any other criminal matters mentioned in the section that I have read, either for the purpose of bringing about a change in industrial control, or a political change, then it would constitute criminal syndicalism.'\n\n While one of the purposes of such improper loading of ships may be to create more work for the men, and so to inflict loss on employers, it is also plainly calculated to endanger the vessels, their cargoes, and the lives of those aboard. By the instruction complained of the consideration of the jury was limited to 'things of that kind.' The advocating of the malicious commission of such acts is to teach and abet sabotaghe-physical damage and injury to physical property; it also is to teach and abet crime and unlawful methods of terrorism. It was not necessary for the prosecution to show that the elements of criminal syndicalism were advocated or taught with the precision of statement required in indictments for criminal acts involved. Cf. Wong Tai v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 77\n, 47 S. Ct. 300, decided January 3, 1927. The purpose and probable effect of the printed matter circulated and of the things said in furtherance of the declared purposes of the organization are to be considered having regard to the capacity and circumstances of the persons sought to be influenced. When there is taken into account the evidence referred to and the parts of the charge preceding and following the part of the charge here assailed-and especially the giving and reiteration of the statutory language defining sabotage-it is quite apparent that the instruction was not erroneous.\n Both sides have dealt with the case here as if the question were properly raised, and we have considered its merits. McNitt v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352, 362; Baltimore & Potomac Railroad v. Mackey, \n157 \nU.S. 72, 86\n, 15 S. Ct. 491; Norfolk- \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 336]\n\u00a0\n & W. R. Co. v. Earnest, \n229 \nU.S. 114\n, 33 S. Ct. 654, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 172; Cf. West v. Rutledge Timber Co., \n244 \nU.S. 90, 99\n, 100 S., 37 S. Ct. 587. But, after examining the record, we think plaintiff in error failed to make any objection or effectively to take exception to the charge complained of. The exception there indicated did not call the court's attention to the instruction now attacked. It was general in form, and applied to the series of statements that followed it, covering about two pages of the record. Plaintiff in error does not contend that all of them are erroneous, and obviously they are not. The rule is well established that, where a series of instructions are excepted to in mass, the exception will be overruled, if any one of them is correct. Johnson v. Jones, 1 Black, 209, 220; Beaver v. Taylor, \n93 U.S. 46\n, 54; McDermott v. Severe, \n202 \nU.S. 600, 610\n, 26 S. Ct. 709. Exceptions to a charge must be specifically made, in order to give the court opportunity then and there to correct errors and omissions, if any. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Minds, \n250 \nU.S. 368, 375\n, 39 S. Ct. 531, and cases cited; Allis v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 117, 122\n, 15 S. Ct. 36. Even if some of the instructions were erroneous, the exceptions taken were not such as to require a new trial.\n\n 2. \nPlaintiff in error complains of another part of the charge:\n'There has been evidence here that advertisements were published in the official organs of the Industrial Workers of the World, what they call also stickerettes, calling upon people to boycott the entire state of California and its products. That would only be legal in the event that it was in furtherance of a strike, and by 'legal' I mean as established by the state of California; that is to say, if it was in furtherance of a strike, if it was in good faith, an attempt to better their conditions, and if it did not indulge in maliciousness or misrepresentation. If, however, in maliciousness or misrepresentation. If, however, was not so, then it would be an illegal \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 337]\n\u00a0\n boycott and you could take it into consideration in determining the facts of this case.'\n\n The record does not contain all the evidence, and fails to show that it includes all relating to the matter referred to in this instruction. We think it cannot be said as a matter of law that the things there mentioned, when taken in connection with other facts, may not have been proper for consideration in connection with some element of the criminal syndicalism charged. Moreover, no objection was made or exception properly taken to that part of the charge. Here again the exception failed specifically to point out the instruction now assailed as erroneous.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n This writ of error was allowed under section 238 of the Judicial Code, on constitutional grounds, prior to the amendment of February 13, 1925. All alleged errors at the trial which were properly excepted to are therefore before us. Chaloner v. Sherman, \n242 \nU.S. 455, 457\n, 37 S. Ct. 136. There was, at least, one error committed which, in my opinion, justifies reversal and which does not involve a constitutional question. For that reason, according to the practice approved by the court, I refrain from discussing the constitutional questions presented. See Liverpool, N. Y. & Phila. Steamship Co. v. Emigration Comm'rs, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S. Ct. 352; Chicago & G. T. R. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S. Ct. 400; Howat v. Kansas, \n258 \nU.S. 181, 184\n, 42 S. Ct. 277.\n The defendant was convicted on the count which charges him with becoming a member of an organization formed to advocate criminal syndicalism. The California statute defines criminal syndicalism as advocating sabotage, among other things, and it defines sabotage 'as \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 338]\n\u00a0\n meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property.' To prove the crime, the government undertook to show that the defendant was a member of the I. W. W. and that the I. W. W. advocated, among other things, the use of sabotage. On that subject the trial judge gave the following instruction, which was duly excepted to:\n'Sabotage has been variously defined. Webster's New International Dictionary defines it as 'scamped work; malicious waste or destruction of an employer's property by workmen during labor troubles.' Funk & Wagnalls' New Standard Dictionary defines it as 'any poor work or other damage done by dissatisfied workmen; also, the act of producing it; plant wrecking.' Nelson's Encyclopedia defines it thus: 'The organized hampering of production by slack work, skillful disabling of machinery or the publication of trade secrets.' The New International Encyclopedia defines it thus: 'Sabotage may consist in throwing the progress of production out of order, through tampering with machinery, improper use of material, or loitering at work.' The Encyclopedia Americana defines it as: 'A method used by labor revolutionists to force employers to accede to demands made by them. It consists in willful obstruction and interference with the normal process of industry. It aims at inconveniencing and tying up of production, but stops short of actual destruction or of endangering human life directly.'\n\n'The statute, itself, you will notice, however, denounces sabotage as meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property.\n\n'Now, there has been presented to you evidence of the truth or falsity of which, however, you are the exclusive judges, to the effect that this organization, amongst other things, advocated what is known as slowing down on the job, slack or scamped work, such as loading of a ship in such a way that it took a list to port or starboard \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 339]\n\u00a0\n and therefore had to limp back to port, and things of the kind. I instruct you that under the defintion as laid down by the Legislature of California, that any deliberate attempt to reduce the profits in the manner that I have described would constitute sabotage.'\n\n The testimony referred to by the court in the above instruction was this:\n'Under similar circumstances I heard Leo Stark, a member of the I. W. W., say in a speech on May 10, 1923: 'When you go back to work, if we do have to go to work, we will put on the wooden shoe.' Then he said: 'In case you are loading telephone poles on a ship down there, sometime the boss is not looking you can slip a couple of poles crossways and then cover up, and then when that ship goes to sea naturally she will start rolling and the cargo will shift, and then she will come in listed like the one you see out in the harbor, then she has got to tie up to the dock, and she will have to unload the telephone poles and put them in again and put them straight, and then we will get paid for the loading originally and get paid for unloading it and get pay for loading it again, and that will hit the bosses hard in the pocketbook.\n\n'Mr. Lewis: 'I move that that answer be stricken out as immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent, not within the definition of sabotage as laid down in the statute, or the criminal syndicalism law.\n\n'The Court: I cannot see it. As I said before, I cannot see but what any deliberate act, the purpose of which is to reduce the profits of the physical thing, is not equally an injury. Motion denied.\n\n'Mr. Lewis: No note an exception.'\n\n The exception to the charge is insisted on, although the objection to the admission of the evidence is not urged here. The charge was clearly erroneous. It plainly directed the jury that 'slowing down on the job' and 'scamped work' constituted sabotage within the meaning \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 340]\n\u00a0\n of the statute. Since the jury must have taken it to be an exposition or interpretation of the words of the statute, the error was not cured by definition, elsewhere in the charge, of sabotage in the terms of the statute. The court ruled throughout the course of the trial, that evidence to show a program of scamped work was admissible. Much of the government's evidence consisted of documents showing such a program on the part of the I. W. W. The charge inevitably led the jury to think that all such evidence showed the guilty character of the organization.\n It is said that the charge, if erroneous, was not prejudicial, because the illegal character of the organization was established by other evidence than that which formed the basis of the charge, and because even the latter evidence showed the advocacy of acts which amounted to a malicious destruction of property, and so might properly support a conviction even under proper construction of the statute. Even in civil cases erroneous rulings, especially those embodied in instructions, are presumptively prejudicial. Fillippon v. Albion Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76, 82\n, 39 S. Ct. 435; United States v. River Rouge Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 421\n, 46 S. Ct. 144. The illegal character of the organization was not conceded. There was evidence from which the illegal character might have been deduced. But the evidence related, in the main, to the acts of individuals. The effort of the defense was to disavow those acts.\n It is also said that the exception to the charge was not properly taken. The defendant excepted specifically to that portion of the charge which dealt with sabotage. The precise ground of the exception was not set forth. But the continued objections to the admission of evidence upon the ground here urged, and the court's adverse rulings thereon, could have left no doubt in the mind of the court as to what was meant by the exception here in question. Moreover, the case comes to this \n\n[274 U.S. 328, 341]\n\u00a0\n court from a lower federal court. We have, therefore, the power to correct errors committed below although objection was not taken there. That power has been repeatedly exercised in criminal cases. See Wiborg v. United States, \n163 U.S. 632\n, 658-660, 16 S. Ct. 1127, 1197; Clyatt v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 207, 221\n, 222 S., 25 S. Ct. 429.

S.(1927)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Claude R. Porter, of Des Moines, Iowa, for petitioner.\n Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted in the federal District Court for the Southern District of Iowa upon two counts for unlaw- \n\n[273 U.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n fully having in his possession with fraudulent intent certain counterfeit strip stamps of the kind used upon whisky bottled in bond. The stamps were admitted in evidence over the objection of petitioner that they had been obtained by an unlawful search and seizure. A timely motion previously made by the petitioner to return or impound the stamps was overruled. The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 4 F.( 2d) 507.\n The stamps were found in executing a search warrant issued by the judge of a state municipal court and addressed to 'any peace officer of Des Moines, Polk county, Iowa,' directing search for intoxicating liquors and instruments and materials used in the manufacture of such liquors. The information upon which the search warrant was issued states only that affiant 'has good reason to believe and does believe the defendant has in his possession' such intoxicating liquors, instruments and materials. The warrant clearly is bad if tested by the Fourth Amendment and the laws of the United States. Chapter 30, tit. 11,  3-6, 40 Stat. 217, 228, 229 ( Comp. St.  10496 1\/4 c-10496 1\/4 f); chapter 85, tit. 2,  2, 41 Stat. 305, 308 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 a). See Ripper v. United States (C. C. A.) 178 F. 24, 26; United States v. Borkowski (D. C.) 268 F. 408, 410, 411; United States v. Kelly (D. C.) 277 F. 485, 486-489. Whether it is good under the state law it is not necessary to inquire, since in no event could it constitute the basis for a federal search and seizure, as, under the facts hereinafter stated, it is insisted this was.\n Nor is it material that the search was successful in revealing evidence of a violation of a federal statute. A search prosecuted in violation of the Constitution is not made lawful by what it brings to light; and the doctrine has never been recognized by this court, nor can it be tolerated under our constitutional system, that evidences of crime discovered by a federal officer in making a search without lawful warrant may be used against the victim of \n\n[273 U.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n the unlawful search where a timely challenge has been interposed.

Ct. 4.\n The warrant directs the officer to search certain described premises and, if any of the liquors, instruments or materials set forth in the information are found, to seize the same and keep them until final action be had thereon. It was put into the hands of Mr. Densmore, a local officer in charge of the night liquor bureau of the police station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he, together with three others, proceeded to make the search in circumstances which can best be shown by quoting from the testimony given upon the hearing of the motion to impound or return the property seized. Mr. Densmore testified as follows:\n'As I came down stairs, I asked the captain about Mr. Adams, who was there, and I asked him to go with me. Mr. Adams is the federal prohibition agent, stationed here in Des Moines, Iowa, an officer of the government, operating under the Treasury Department. I met him after the warrant has been sued out, and asked him to go with me. I had the warrant at that time. It was in the police station of the city that I met Mr. Adams and requested him to come along. I had not discussed this case with Mr. Adams before that. He went with me from the city building on the search. As far as I know, he did not have any warrant or any authority to go into that residence other than the authority that I may have given him under the warrant I had. The search and seizure was made entirely upon the authority of the warrant that I had obtained at the City Hall. Arriving at the residence, I assigned each man a room. I assigned Adams a room. We found no intoxicating liquors there. The only thing that we found that we took were the stamps in- \n\n[273 U.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n volved in this case. Mr. Taylor found part of them, and Mr. Adams found part of them. Mr. Adams kept the stamps he found in his possession and those found by Mr. Taylor were turned over to him right at that time. The ones that Adams found and the ones that were given to him were taken possession of by Adams right there in the house of A. J. Byars, immediately after the service. Neither myself or any of the other city officers had possession of those stamps after that evening. There was never any prosecution attempted in the city courts or such courts as I was connected with so far as these stamps were involved.'\n\n Mr. Adams, the federal prohibition agent, testified:\n'I remember assisting in the search of the residence of A. J. Byars on the 22d day of April, 1924. Officers Densmore, Taylor, De Haven, and Davis were with me. I met them in the captain's office at the police station in the city of Des Moines, and accompanied them to make the search. I had no authority for going into the house other than the search warrant that the officers had secured from the state authorities. The only authority that I had for going into the house of Mr. Byars was on account of the search warrant that Mr. Densmore had. I searched the kitchen. I found some of the stamps that were involved in this case there in the kitchen. I took possession of them then and there, and have retained them ever since. I have retained the stamps that I found and those that were handed me there in the house. I was not present with Mr. Taylor in the room when he found the stamps, but they were brought to me in the dining room by Mr. Taylor, and I took possession of them then and there, and I have retained possession of all the stamps from that time until this. They were never delivered to the state officers or used by them. I do not know of any violation of any state law that they could be used for. I knew there was no state law governing the possession of \n\n[273 U.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n these stamps, and as a federal officer, I took possession of what I found, and those found by the state officer, and have had them in my possession ever since and receipted to the police officers at the station that evening after the return from the raid, for the stamps found.'\n\n While it is true that the mere participation in a state search of one who is a federal officer does not render it a federal undertaking, the court must be vigilant to scrutinize the attendant facts with an eye to detect and a hand to prevent violations of the Constitution by circuitous and indirect methods. Constitutional provisions for the security of person and property are to be liberally construed, and 'it is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.' Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S. Ct. 524, 535 (29 L. Ed. 746); Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. page 304, 41 S. Ct. 261, supra.\n The attendant facts here reasonably suggest that the federal prohibition agent was not invited to join the state squad as a private person might have been, but was asked to participate and did participate as a federal enforcement officer, upon the chance, which was subsequently realized, that something would be disclosed of official interest to him as such agent. The house to be searched contained only four rooms-a dining room, a kitchen, and two bedrooms. We are not prepared to accept the view that the local officer thought a force of four men would be insufficient to search these limited premises; and it is significant in that connection that he did not ask his superior officer for additional help, but inquired particularly for Adams, who, he knew, was the federal agent. The stamps found were not within the purview of the state search warrant, nor did they relate in any way to a violation of state law. Those found by the agent were held by him as of right and without question; those found by the state officer were considered by both the local officer \n\n[273 U.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n in charge and the federal agent as things which concerned the federal government alone and then and there were surrendered to the exclusive possession of the federal agent-a practical concession that he was present in his federal character. We cannot avoid the conclusion that the participation of the agent in the search was under color of his federal office and that the search in substance and effect was a joint operation of the local and federal officers. In that view, so far as this inquiry is concerned, the effect is the same as though he had engaged in the undertaking as one exclusively his own. Similar questions have been presented in a variety of forms to the lower federal courts, but nothing is to be gained by attempting to review the decisions, since each of them rests, as the present case does, upon its own peculiar facts. But see and compare Flagg v. United States (C. C. A.) 233 F. 481, 483; United States v. Slusser (D. C.) 270 F. 818, 820; United States v. Falloco (D. C.) 277 F. 75, 82; Legman v. United States (C. C. A.) 295 F. 474, 476-478; Marron v. United States (C. C. A.) 8 F.(2d) 251, 259; United States v. Brown (D. C.) 8 F.(2d) 630, 631.\n We do not question the right of the federal government to avail itself of evidence improperly seized by state officers operating entirely upon their own account. But the rule is otherwise when the federal government itself, through its agents acting as such, participates in the wrongful search and seizure. To hold the contrary would be to disregard the plain spirit and purpose of the constitutional prohibitions intended to secure the people against unauthorized official action. The Fourth Amendment was adopted in view of long misuse of power in the matter of searches and seizures both in England and the colonies; and the assurance against any revival of it, so carefully embodied in the fundamental law, is not to be impaired by judicial sanction of equivocal methods, \n\n[273 U.S. 28, 34]\n\u00a0\n which, regarded superficially, may seem to escape the challenge of illegality but which, in reality, strike at the substance of the constitutional right.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHARLESTON, S. C., MINING & MFG. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 93\nArgued: January 10, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin C. Brandenburg, of Washington, D. C., and Wm. Wade Hampton, of Gainesville, Fla., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a bill in equity brought by the United States in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, by direction of the Attorney General against the Charleston, South Carolina, Mining & Manufacturing Company, to have declared void the approval and certification by the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office of 320 acres of the public lands of the United States in Polk county, Fla., to the state of Florida, title to which was transferred by mesne conveyances from the state of Florida to defendant mining company. The bill averred that the selection, approval, and certification had been procured from the government land officials upon fraudulent representations with reference to the nonmineral character of the land; the representations having been made in an affidavit at the instance of the defendant company and with its knowledge, for the purpose of securing such conveyance to the state and through the state authorities to the defendant. \n\n[273 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n The prayer was that the title or conveyance be held for naught and be delivered up and surrendered for cancellation, that the described lands be adjudged the property of the United States, that the defendants be enjoined from setting up any claim thereto or creating any cloud upon the title of the United States, and that the possession might be restored to the United States. An answer was filed by the defendant, denying the averments of the bill, and there was a full hearing upon evidence. The District Court held that the evidence of fraud was established in reference to 280 of the 320 acres described in the bill, and as to that the relief prayed for was granted; but the bill was dismissed as to the remaining 40 acres. 298 F. 127. On appeal of the defendant, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decree of the District Court. 3 F. (2d) 1019. The case came to this court on appeal taken on February 7, 1925, under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218 ), as a suit to which the United States was a party, which was not made final by the other provisions of the Judiciary Title.\n The evidence for the government tended to show the following: In 1906, Singleton, acting for and in the employ of the appellant, prospected for phosphate deposits in the vicinity of these lands. He explored by making borings in a tract of 360 acres adjacent to the one in suit, which on his recommendation was purchased by the appellant for $40,000. The 280 acres here restored to the government by the lower courts contained, according to borings and tests made in 1910, phosphates which ran from 61 to 66.84 per cent., and it appeared that at that time phosphate at 60 per cent. could be profitably mined. The land belonged to the United States. Singleton's plan was to secure the 320 acres in question as indemnity for school sections 16 conveyed by the United States to Florida under the Act of March 3, 1845, c. 75, 5 Stat. 788. Singleton arranged with one Stewart to induce the state \n\n[273 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n land agent, Hampton, to make the selection. Stewart in turn procured on Hollingsworth to make an affidavit that the land was nonmineral. Hollingsworth made a superficial inspection of the lands in company with Singleton, but obtained no information sufficient to disclose whether the lands contained phosphates or not. Singleton knew that Hollingsworth was to make the affidavit without any real knowledge as to the character of the lands, which, so far as singleton and defendant were concerned, made the affidavit false. With this affidavit, and at the instance of the defendant's agent, Hampton innocently applied to the United States to make the selection and cause the lands to be certified to the state as indemnity lands selected under statute.\n There was a conflict of evidence, but the District Court found the facts as above, and that the defendant was guilty of fraud in procuring a false affidavit upon which the selection and certification of the lands were secured. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the finding of the lower court.\n The rule is well estabished that this court will not disturb a finding of fact made by a District Court in equity, concurred in by the Circuit Court of Appeals, except in case of the clearest error.

Cas. 501.\n We therefore are limited in this cause to the question of law which is raised whether the indemnity selection \n\n[273 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n here made was valid even if it was for known mineral land. The grant of March 3, 1845, to Florida, read as follows:\n'That in consideration of the concessions made by the state of Florida in respect to the public lands, there be granted to the said state eight entire sections of land for the purpose of fixing their seat of government; also, section number 16 in every township, or other lands equivalent thereto, for the use of the inhabitants of such township, for the support of public schools. ... ' Section 1.\n\n It is said that this constitutes a binding compact between the state and the United States, which cannot be abrogated, and that the state was entitled to every section 16, whether mineral or agricultural, and that in case of loss the state had the specific right to select from vacant lands of the United States in that state other lands without reference to the character of the lands so selected, whether mineral or otherwise.\n The District Judge expressed himself as impressed with this argument, but said that he was bound by the decision of this court in United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563\n, 38 S. Ct. 193, in which this court held that under section 6 of the Utah Enabling Act of July 16, 1894, 28 Stat. 107, a grant of section 16 in place for school purposes, in view of the settled policy of Congress to dispose of mineral lands only under laws specially including them, was not intended to embrace lands known to be valuable for coal. It is urged that the District Judge erred in applying the Sweet Case to the case here, because the decision of this court in Work v. Louisiana, \n269 \nU.S. 250\n, 46 S. Ct. 92, shows that the Sweet Case did not apply to a construction of the Swamp Land Acts under grants made in 1849 and 1850, and that, if the act enacted then contained no exception or reservation of mineral land, none was to be implied, since the policy of withholding mineral lands from disposition, except under law specially including them, was not then established. \n\n[273 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n It is to be observed that the case of Work v. Louisiana applied to a great of swamp lands and did not refer to indemnity lands thereafter to be selected. The phrase in the original grant of 1845 in this case, 'or other lands equivalent thereto' was not self-executing. It could not and did not confer on the beneficiary of the grant the right to make indemnity selections, except as Congress should provide for the exercise of that right.\n The only authority conferred by Congress for selection and certification of indemnity lands for a failure of the grant of a school section No. 16, applicable to the act of 1845, is found in section 2275 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of February 28, 1891, c. 384, 26 Stat. 796 (Comp. St.  4860), and section 2276 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the same act (Comp. St.  4861). These sections are as follows:\n'Sec. 2275. Where settlements with a view to pre-emption or homestead have been, or shall hereafter be made, before the survey of the lands in the field, which are found to have been made on sections sixteen or thirty-six, those sections shall be subject to the claims of such settlers; and if such sections, or either of them, have been or shall be granted, reserved, or pledged for the use of schools or colleges in the state or territory in which they lie, other lands of equal acreage are hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory, in lieu of such as may be thus taken by pre- emption of homestead settlers. And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land, or are included within any Indian, military, or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United States: Provided, where any state is entitled to said sections sixteen and thirty-six, or where said sections are reserved to any territory, notwithstanding the same may be mineral land or embraced \n\n[273 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n within a military, Indian, or other reservation, the selection of such lands in lieu thereof by said state or territory shall be a waiver of its right to said sections. And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory to compensate deficiencies for school purposes, where sections sixteen or thirty-six are fractional in quantity, or where one or both are wanting by reason of the township being fractional, or from any natural cause whatever.\n\n'Section 2276. That the lands appropriated by the preceding section shall be selected from any unappropriated, surveyed public lands, not mineral in character, within the state or territory where such losses or deficiencies of school sections occur; and where the selections are to compensate for deficiencies of shcool lands in fractional townships, such selections shall be made in accordance with the following principles of adjustment, to wit: For each township, or fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than three- quarters of an entire township, one section; for a fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than one-half, and not more than three-quarters of a township, three-quarters of a section; for a fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than one-quarter, and not more than one-half of a township, one- half section; and for a fractional township, containing a greater quantity of land than one entire section, and not more than one- quarter of a township, one-quarter section of land: Provided, that the states or territories which are, or shall be entitled to both the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections in place, shall have the right to select double the amounts named, to compensate for deficiencies of school land in fractional townships.'\n\n The lands here in question were selected by the state by lists filed on February 12 and February 19, 1906, pursuant to these sections, and the selections were supported by an affidavit that the lands were not mineral in char- \n\n[273 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n acter. They were approved December 11, 1907, and were certified to the state December 18, 1907, and were thereupon conveyed by the state to one who took title for the appellant who had procured the selection and the certification. These sections require that the indemnity lands to be conveyed thereunder shall not be mineral in character. Only Congress can convey title to the land of the United States, and it makes no difference what was its equitable obligation to convey title under the original grant of 1845 in respect of indemnity lands. Congress certainly intended to convey as indemnity lands only those described in the act of 1891. There was no power in any one representing the United States, therefore, to convey indemnity land which was mineral in character, and any scheme by which conveyance of such land was obtained was a fraud upon the United States.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O R.

Ct. 632\n\n\n Whether the action lies, depends upon the construction to be given section 1 of the federal Employers' Liability Act, and presents a novel question. That section provides:\n'Every common carrier by railroad ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee.'\n\n For an injury resulting in death, the act gives two distinct causes of action. One is to compensate the injured person for his loss and suffering while he lives. Under the original act, that cause of action did not survive. Michigan Central R. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 U.S. 59\n, 67-68, 33 S. Ct. 192, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 176. Now, under the amendment added as section 9 by Act of April 5, 1910, c. 143,  2, 36 Stat. 291 (45 USCA  59 (Comp. St.  8665)), it survives to the personal representative. St. Louis, Iron Mountain \n\n[275 U.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n & Southern Ry. Co. v. Craft, \n237 \nU.S. 648\n, 35 S. Ct. 704. The second cause of action is to compensate persons other than the injured employee for pecuniary loss suffered by them through the employee's death. While the suit thereon must be brought by the personal representative of the employee, he sues as trustee for the person or persons on whose behalf the act authorizes recovery. The question is whether the sister, being, but for the short survival of the mother, 'next of kin, dependent upon such employee,' is, under the circumstances, entitled to compensation.\n The language of section 1 makes it clear that she is not. The cause of action as there expressed, accrues to the widow and children, if either survives. It accrues to the parents if neither widow nor child survives. It accrues to the next of kin dependent upon the employee only if there is no surviving widow, child, or parent. There are, thus, three classes of possible beneficiaries. But the liability is in the alternative. It is to one of the three; not to the several classes collectively. The contention is that, if the one entitled at the death of the employee to the compensation dies thereafter before a recovery, the action may be brought on behalf of the class next in line. There is no basis in the act for such a shifting of the beneficiary. The statute does not provide for a life interest in one, with remainder over to others in the line of distribution. Nor does it provide for vesting the right to compensation in the one, with a conditional limitation to another, in case the one entitled at the death happens to die thereafter without having secured recovery.\n The cause of action accrues at the death. Reading Co. v. Koons, \n271 \nU.S. 58\n, 46 S. Ct. 405. When it accrues, there is an immediate, final and absolute vesting; and the vesting is in that one of the several possible beneficiaries who, according to the express provision in the statute, is declared entitled to be compensated. Upon Anderson's death, an administrator might have been appointed and \n\n[275 U.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n an action brought immediately. If it had been so brought, it would have been for the benefit solely of the mother; and no other action would have lain. The failure to bring the action in the mother's lifetime did not result in creating a new cause of action after her death for the benefit of the sister.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, M. & ST.

Dudley and Thomas Balmer, both of Seattle, Wash., and F. G. Dorety, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioners.\n Mr. C. E. Elmquist, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n August 20, 1923, respondent made an order reducing the Idaho intrastate rates for the transportation of sawlogs by railroad. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n Court of the State, and there the order was affirmed. 41 Idaho, 181, 238 P. 970.\n The Director General of Railroads by Order No. 28, effective June 25, 1918, advanced all rates. An addition of 25 per cent. was made to the interstate an intrastate rates on sawlogs. In 1920 the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized the carriers further to increase rates. Ex parte 74, 58 I. C. C. 220, 246. The addition to freight rates in the Mountain- Pacific group that includes Idaho was 25 per cent. The respondent authorized additions of 25 per cent. to rates on intrastate freight including sawlogs. In 1922 the Interstate Commerce Commission found the freight rates unreasonable, on and after July 1, 1922, to the extent that the rates in effect immediately before the increases authorized in Ex parte 74 were exceeded by more than specified percentages; and that stated for the Mountain-Pacific group was 12 1\/2 per cent. The carriers were authorized to reduce rates in accordance with these findings. Reduced Rates, 1922, 68 I. C. C. 676, 734. As applied to interstate traffic in sawlogs, such reduction was 10 per cent. Respondent authorized corresponding reductions on Idaho intrastate freight. While the reductions were generally made by the railroads throughout the country and in Idaho, the petitioners did not make any reduction of interstate or intrastate rates on logs. And no reduction of the interstate rate has been ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n September 28, 1922, the respondent ordered petitioners, by answer filed within a specified time, to show 'compliance or noncompliance in the matter of reduction of rates on sawlogs and other forest products intrastate within the state of Idaho in accordance with the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission,' and that they show cause why such reduction should not be made. The \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Great Northern, and the Northern Pacific answered. Each stated that it had put in effect the reduced rates on intrastate freight except sawlogs, and that it had not reduced interstate or intrastate rates on sawlogs because the existing rates were unreasonably low and confiscatory and should be increased. At the hearing the carriers offered evidence that the existing rates were unreasonably low and confiscatory. The Western Pine Manufacturers' Association intervened to support the proposed reduction. It has about 59 members who manufacture annually about 1,500,000,000 feet of lumber in the inland empire-eastern Washington and Oregon, Idaho, and Western Montana. The logs hauled intrastate in Idaho constitute a very small part of those sawed by the members of the association. The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul analyzed its Idaho intrastate log traffic in the first 10 days of each month in 1921. It hauled 3,876 carloads an average distance of 36.2 miles for $68, 174.17. It introduced evidence to show that taxes, operating expenses, rentals, and interest on investment chargeable to that traffic amounted to $ 94,658.13, and that taxes and operating expenses alone amounted to $62,622. 88. The Great Northern in 1921 hauled 2,620 carloads an average distance of 26.2 miles for $46,130.87, and offered evidence that operating expenses chargeable to that traffic exceeded revenue. The Northern Pacific in the year ending October 1, 1922, hauled 240 carloads. There was no evidence indicating revenue received from or operating expenses chargeable to that traffic. But the company called as a witness its special traffic representative, a man of long experience in its operating and traffic departments, who testified that in his opinion the rates were confiscatory. The Spokane & International in 1921 hauled 1,250 carloads for about $22, 800. The witnesses \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n called by petitioners made comparisons of rates and testified that those on logs were relatively low. The Western Pine Manufacturers' Association, by cross-examination of carrier witnesses and by the testimony of its traffic manager, showed that in the Northwest the Northern Pacific originally established the rates on logs, and made them very low in order to move the logs to the mills for the manufacture of lumber to be shipped long distances to Eastern markets; that carriers later building into that territory pursued the same policy and that the rates in Idaho were so made; that these rates remained until federal control; that some of the tariffs state that the rates are established to furnish logs to manufacturers who are to forward equivalent products over the carrier's railroad; and that, if the condition is not complied with, higher rates will be charged. It was not shown to what extent, if any, such higher rates were collected. The traffic manager of the association testified that practically all of the lumber moved long distances in interstate commerce; that freight on logs is a part of the manufacturer's operating cost, while freight on lumber is borne by the consumer. By way of illustration, it was estimated that the logs hauled intrastate in Idaho by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul in 1921 would produce lumber sufficient to yield freight revenue of $ 1,279,080, and that those hauled by the Great Northern would make lumber enough to produce $288,123.\n The respondent found the existing rates on sawlogs unreasonable and discriminatory and ordered the carriers to file tariffs 'in compliance with the reductions in the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission ... applicable to shipments on sawlogs intrastate. ...' Respondent's opinion gives the following reasons: The existing relation between rates on logs and those on other commodities should be maintained. Hauling logs to the \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n mill is incident to the lumber traffic, which includes the transportation of the finished products from the mill. A branch line carrying logs may not of itself yield sufficient revenue to pay operating expenses, but, when it receives credits to which it is entitled as part of the system, it is generally a good revenue producer. As all freight rates had been twice advanced, it was just and reasonable that the reduction authorized should apply to all commodities. The evidence submitted 'does not justify the contention of the carriers that the rates on sawlogs are too low when compared to rates on other commodities, as the transportation of sawlogs from the forest to the mill furnishes profitable business to the railroad system.' The hearing was not a rate hearing, but was held for the purpose of giving the carriers an opportunity to show why they had not reduced rates on logs 'in accordance with the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' Respondent had theretofore, 'without hearing, adopted the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission and made orders authorizing and permitting rate increases where the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission determined that such rate increases were justifiable and reasonable;' and 'now, when the Interstate Commerce Commission ... determines that certain rates are unjustifiable and unreasonable, this commission sees no reason why it should change its method of procedure and proceed to a hearing on rates affecting intrastate shipments.' And it said:\n'This commission adopts the findings made by the Interstate Commerce Commission ... and will order that tariffs be filed in accordance with said findings applicable to intrastate shipments on sawlogs.'\n\n Following the state practice the case was heard in the Supreme Court on the record made before the respondent. The court held that the respondent was authorized to reduce the rates in question without finding them un- \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n just or unreasonable. And, as to petitioners' insistence that the rates prescribed by the order are confiscatory, it said (page 197, 238 P. 975):\n'If it were conceded, ... that the evidence shows that the existing rates are already insufficient to pay such returns upon the capital ... as the law prescribes to be a reasonable return upon the capital invested, it would not necessarily follow that the rates would be confiscatory for the reason that the evidence also tends to show that the rates paid the carriers for the hauling of logs from the forest to the mill is only one step in the process of reducing the lumber in the forest tree to the finished product and delivering the same to the ultimate consumer. ... The revenue derived from the shipment of logs ... is only an incident to the traffic, and should not be considered as an independent rate, but the rate must be considered in connection with the entire revenue earned' by transporting the logs and the lumber.\n\n The evidence introduced by the carriers was sufficient to warrant, if not to require, a finding that, as to the lines of all the petitioners, the intrastate log rates in question are very low in comparison with the rates on other commodities, and that, as to the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul and the Great Northern, they are confiscatory. But, as appears from their opinions, the respondent and the court refused to consider and give weight to that evidence because, as they held, the intrastate log rates were not to be dealt with separately but were to be considered in connection with the interstate lumber rates, and because the carriers made no showing as to the gains or losses resulting from the interstate transportation. That cannot be sustained. The carriers cannot maintain interstate lumber rates higher than otherwise justified by showing that they suffer loss or have inadequate returns from the intrastate transportation of logs. The state has no power to require petitioners to haul the logs at a \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n loss, or without compensation that is reasonable and just, even if they receive adequate revenues from the intrastate log haul and the interstate lumber haul taken together.

Corp., \n268 \nU.S. 413, 421\n, 45 S. Ct. 534\n\n\n This case is in principle the same as Northern Pacific v. Dept. Public Works, supra. That case involved the validity of an order of the Washington Department of Public Works, reducing the intrastate log rates. The carriers assailed them as confiscatory, and introduced persuasive evidence that the rates existing before the reduction were not sufficient to pay operating expenses and taxes. The department, without attacking the proof or attempting to show by reasonably specific and direct evidence what the actual operating costs were, lowered the rates on the basis of a composite figure representing the weighted average operating cost per thousand gross ton miles on all revenue freight carried on the railroad systems. We applied the rule (page 44, 45 S. Ct. 414) that, where rates found by a regulatory body to be compensatory are attacked as being confiscatory, the courts may inquire into the method by which its conclusion was reached. Cf. United States v. Abilene & S. R. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S. Ct. 565; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Ct. 108. And we held that the method pursued by the department was fundamentally erroneous and constituted a denial of due process of law.\n As the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1922 do not expressly relate to intrastate rates, they are to be deemed to apply exclusively to interstate commerce. Moreover, it appears from its report that \n\n[274 U.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n the Commission did not consider, or intend to make any findings as to, the Idaho intrastate rates on logs. The respondent misinterpreted the effect of the rate advances made in 1918 and 1920. The orders making them did not affect the rights of the carriers or the duties of respondent in respect of subsequent rate reductions. The findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission permitting reductions of interstate rates did not justify respondent in declining to proceed to a hearing or in adopting such findings as the basis of its order. And, as no reduction of the corresponding interstate log rates has been made by petitioners or ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the respondent's order destroys the relation between the intrastate and the interstate log rates in the same territory. It is impossible to sustain the refusal to consider the evidence introduced by the carriers to show that the rates in question are too low and confiscatory. The commission and the court erred in holding that the reasonableness or validity of the intrastate log rates depends on the amounts received by petitioners for the interstate transportation of lumber. It is clear that the methods by which respondent reached its conclusion were arbitrary and constitute a denial of 'due process' of law.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R. I. & P. RY. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 190\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. B. Enoch, of Chicago, Ill., M. G. Roberts, of St. Louis, Mo., and Thomas P. Littlepage and M. L. Bell, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Messrs. D. W. Knowlton and P. J. Farrell, both of Washington, D. C., for appellee Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. R. C. Fulbright, of Houston, Tex., for appellee Houston Cotton Exchange and Board of Trade and others.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to annul, and enjoin the enforcement of, an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing joint rail and water and rail water and rail rates (both hereinafter designated as rail and water rates) on cotton from points in Oklahoma, via Galveston and certain steamship lines, to New England destinations. The complaint before the Commission was brought by the Houston Cotton Exchange and Board of Trade and other similar organizations against appellants and a number of other carriers, to have prescribed and established just and reasonable joint through rates on cotton from Oklahoma points through Texas ports to various points of destination in the northeastern part of the United States and Canada, including New England territory. The \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n modified final order of the Commission required appellants to establish and maintain for the transportation of cotton from Oklahoma points, via Galveston and the lines of the Mallory Steamship Company and the Southern Pacific Company-Atlantic Steamship Lines, to destinations in New England territory, joint rail and water rates not exceeding 'rates 4 cents per 100 pounds lower than the present all-rail rates from and to the same points,' not, however, lower than $1.50 per 100 pounds. Prior to the Commission's order, no joint rail and water rates on cotton were in effect between the points mentioned. The rate to New York consisted of the local rail rate to Galveston, plus the water rate therefrom and a loading charge. To New England points, the rate was made by adding the rail rate beyond New York. The all-rail routes from Oklahoma to the New England territory points are through St. Louis, Memphis, and other Mississippi crossing; and the joint all-rail rates were lower to New England destinations than the combination of local rail and water rates. On commodities other than cotton, joint rail and water rates were in effect, and these were lower than the all- rail rates. The Commission found that the establishment of joint rail and water rates on cotton between the points in question was desirable in the public interest, and that the existing rates for such transportation were unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded or may exceed rates constructed by the deduction of 4 cents from the present all-rail rates. 87 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 392; 93 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 268. The court below, consisting of three judges, after a hearing, entered a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity. (D. C.) 6 F.(2d) 888.\n Appellants assign 21 specifications of error; but the objections to the Commission's order, so far as necessary to be considered here, may be summarized as follows: (1) The Commission undertook to equalize rail and water rates with the all-rail rates, a power which it does not \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n possess; (2) if the order be treated as made under the power to fix reasonable rates, it is arbitrary and without supporting evidence; (3) the result of the order is to short-haul appellants' lines, contrary to paragraph 4,  15, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by section 418 of the Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 485 (Comp. St.  8583); and (4) the order is based upon paragraph 13 of section 6, added to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Panama Canal Act of August 24, 1912, c. 390, 37 Stat. 560, 568 (Comp. St.  8569), and is therefore void because the authority of the Commission was not invoked under that paragraph.\n First. Appellants' argument under this head seems to be predicated upon the contention that the order of the Commission established an exact relationship between the rail and water rates and the present all-rail rates; the differential of 4 cents being, it is said, the amount charged by insurance companies as a premium for insurance to cover the risk of water transportation, and that an analysis of the Commission's order and report shows that the Commission itself recognized that it was undertaking to make such an equalization. The complaint before the Commission plainly sought the establishment of reasonable rates, and the order of the Commission directed and carriers to discountinue the then existing rates made up of combinations of local rates and substitute the maximum joint rates which were prescribed in the words already stated. The Commission found that rates were and would be unreasonable to the extent they exceeded or might exceed those prescribed. In form, the action of the Commission was responsive to the case made by the complaint, and to hold that, in fact, its order was not one fixing reasonable rates, but an order equalizing rates, would be to put undue stress upon certain recitals contained in the report, to which our attention is called but which need not be detailed. If these recitals stood alone, they might give plausibility to the contention; \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n but, from a consideration of the entire record, we think it quite unfair to conclude that the Commission undertook to exercise an authority entirely different and distinct from that which the complaint specifically invoked.\n There is nothing in Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 433\n, 31 S. Ct. 288, that requires a different conclusion. In that case it appeared upon the face of the record that the Commission had not exerted its power to correct an unjust and unreasonable rate, but had made the order complained of upon the theory that it possessed the power to set aside a just and reasonable rate whenever the Commission deemed that it would be equitable to shippers in a particular district to put in force a reduced rate. In reaching that conclusion, the court thought that the complaint and answer presented the latter issue; that, while the opinion of the Commission might contain some sentences indicating the contrary, when considered as a whole, in the light of the record, it clearly appeared that the order was based upon that theory; and that this was borne out by the dissenting opinion, which proceeded upon the express ground that the order was an exertion of a power not possessed, with no language in the prevailing opinion to indicate the contrary. Here, it is true, the order fixes the rail and water rate by relating it in terms to the all-rail rate; but, since we accept the view that the former was, in fact, established as a just and reasonable rate, there can be no objection to the form of words adopted as a method of short and convenient description of that rate. The power of the Commission to equalize rates, if its authority to that end should be invoked, is not involved.\n Second. If the order of the Commission be unsupported by the evidence, it is, of course, void. New England Divisions Case. \n261 \nU.S. 184, 203\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. But, if the determination of the Commission finds substantial support in the evidence, the courts will not weigh the evidence nor consider \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n the wisdom of the Commission's action. \n261 U.S. 204\n (43 S. Ct. 278); Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States (December 13, 1926) \n272 \nU.S. 658\n, 47 S. Ct. 222. The order here does not rest alone upon comparisons with the all-rail rates, as seems to be contended, but is supported by other established facts and circumstances as well. See Western Chem. Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 46 S. Ct. 500. Nothing is to be gained by a review of the evidence. It is enough to say that both the Commission and the lower court thought it was ample to justify the order, and, upon a consideration of the entire record, we find no reason to differ with them in that conclusion.\n Third. Does the order of the Commission result in short-hauling appellants' lines contrary to the provisions of paragraph 4 of section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act 1920? The pertinent provision of that paragraph is that the Commission, in establishing a through route, shall not, 'except where one of the carriers is a water line,' require any railroad carrier to embrace in such route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad lying between the termini of the proposed through route. That the through routes here established by the Commission's order do embrace substantially less than the entire length of appellants' railroads, etc., is not denied. And appellants' contention is that the exception, 'where one of the carriers is a water line,' has reference only to such a carrier as comes within the description of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which provides, among other things, that the provisions of the act shall apply to common carriers engaged in-\n'(a) The transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water when both are used under a common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment. ...' Chapter 91, 41 Stat. 456, 474 (Comp. St.  8563).\n\n Appellees insist that the rail and water lines here involved come within the italicized portion of this provision. \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n But it is unnecessary to pass upon that question, since clearly the order in this respect can be sustained under the later and broader provisions of paragraph 13 of section 6, added to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Panama Canal Act, supra. That paragraph provides-\n'When property may be or is transported from point to point in the United States by rail and water through the Panama Canal or otherwise, the transportation being by a common carrier or carriers, and not entirely within the limits of a single state, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall have jurisdiction of such transportation and of the carriers, both by rail and by water, which may or do engage in the same, in the following particulars, in addition to the jurisdiction given by the act to regulate commerce as amended June eighteenth, nineteen hundred and ten:\n\n'(b) To establish through routes and maximum joint rates between and over such rail and water lines, and to determine all the terms and conditions under which such lines shall be operated in the handling of the traffic embraced.'\n\n This addition to the Interstate Commerce Act materially extends the jurisdiction of the Commission in respect of land and water transportation and the carriers engaged in it, whenever property may be or is transported in interstate commerce by rail and water by a common carrier or carriers; and the obvious intention of Congress would be substantially limited in effect if the quoted provisions were held to be subject to the restriction that both rail and water must be used under a common control, etc. The phrase, 'except where one of the carriers is a water line,' was introduced in an amendment made to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Transportation Act, 1920, and it is not unreasonable to include within the scope of its reference, the then existing paragraph 13 \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n of section 6. And this view is strengthened by the consideration that the Transportation Act 1920, as a part of the new policy which it introduced in respect of the regulation of interstate transportation (Wisconsin R. R. Comm. v. C., B. & Q. R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 585\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; New England Divisions Case, supra, page 189 (43 S. Ct. 273)), directed the Commission to establish through routes, joint classifications, etc., both in respect of railroad and water carriers, 'whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest,' etc. 41 Stat. 485. And the same act declares it to be 'the policy of Congress to promote, encourage, and develop water transportation, service, and facilities in connection with the commerce of the United States, and to foster and preserve in full vigor both rail and water transportation.' Section 500, 41 Stat. 499 (Comp. St.  10071 1\/4 k).\n These and other provisions emphasize the intention of Congress to broaden the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission over rail and water transportation and generally to extend the regulatory power of that body over all such transportation in the public interest. It would be quite inconsistent with that broad purpose to adopt the narrow construction of the statutory provisions under review which is advanced by appellants. On the whole, and especially in the light of the definite congressional policy which the legislation reflects (Richardson v. Harmon, \n222 \nU.S. 96, 104\n, 32 S. Ct. 27; Holden v. Stratton, \n198 \nU.S. 202, 213\n, 214 S., 25 S. Ct. 656; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 395 S., 22 S. Ct. 650), we find no difficulty in rejecting the construction thus advanced and adopting that which we have indicated, without, at the same time, doing violence to the fair meaning of the language actually employed.\n Fourth. In disposing of the final objection, little need be said. The contention is that the Commission was without power to predicate its order on paragraph 13 of section 6 of the act, because there is no formal reference in the complaint to that paragraph nor an order for an investi- \n\n[274 U.S. 29, 37]\n\u00a0\n gation under it on the Commission's own motion. But the allegations of the complaint in matters of fact were sufficient to authorize the Commission to consider the case under that provision as well as others; and this is enough. To plead the law relied on is no more necessary in a proceeding before the Commission than it is in a judicial proceeding.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF HAMMOND v.

Ct. 92. As in City of Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, Inc., \n275 \nU.S. 164\n, 48 S. Ct. 66, decided this day, the plaintiff, Farina Bus Line & Transportation Company, is an Illinois corporation; the defendant is the city of Hammond; the relief sought is an injunction to prevent the enforcement of Ordinance No. 1945, adopted May 23, 1925; and the relief was denied by the District Court, without finding any facts and without opinion. The Circuit Court of Appeals (11 F.(2d) 943) reversed the decree and remanded the case, with directions 'to enter a decree granting the injunction.' The decision was rendered on the same day \n\n[275 U.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n on which that court rendered its decision in the Schappi Case. It, also, made no finding of facts. It filed no opinion and gave no reasons for its action save the statement that 'the discussion there applies equally to this case.'\n The Farina Company operates a route from several small cities in Illinois through the town of Munster, Ind., to its terminal in the business district of Hammond. There its busses connect with an allied street railway, which extends from Hammond into the city of Gary, Ind., and through passengers from the Illinois cities to Gary pass over this route. A small percentage of the business is intercity traffic between Munster and Hammond, and hence intrastate. The Farina Company holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Public Service Commission of Indiana under the acts of 1925 (Acts 1925, cc. 46, 213) for all its routes. The Farina Company alleges that the ordinance, if enforced, will necessitate abandonment, not only of the existing routes, but of its business. The evidence, consisting mainly of affidavits, is conflicting.\n The contentions, the issues of fact and of law, and the character of the evidence introduced, are largely similar to those in the Schappi Case. But there are differences which may be important. The Calumet Company does not serve Munster or the small Illinois cities, so that it is not a direct competitor of the plaintiff. None of the busses carry local passengers within the city of Hammond. There is also a difference in the stage of the proceedings at which this case came before the Circuit Court of Appeals. It was heard on appeal from the final decree. An application for an interlocutory injunction had been made; but the cause was later submitted to the District Court by agreement of the parties, as upon final hearing, and the bill was dismissed.\n The considerations which led this court to remand the Schappi Case to the District Court for further proceedings \n\n[275 U.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n on final hearing are applicable in the main also to this case. We think that it should be heard by the District Court anew upon final hearing upon evidence to be adduced. To this end, the decree entered in the Circuit court of Appeals is affirmed in so far as it reversed the decree dismissing the bill. In so far as it directs that an injunction issue, it is modified to the extent of directing an injunction pending the suit, instead of a permanent injunction the propriety of the latter being reserved until the final hearing. The cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on final hearing, that court to have liberty, among other things, to allow amendment of the pleadings. Costs in this court are not allowed to either party.\n Decree modified and cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF HAMMOND v. SCHAPPI BUS LINE(1927)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 164, 165]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. B. Tinkham, of Hammond, Ind., and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. J. Whinery, of Hammond, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit which was commenced in the federal court for Indiana in July, 1925, is here on certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n273 \nU.S. 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 92. Schappi Bus Line, Incorporated, an Illinois corporation, seeks to enjoin the city of Hammond, Ind., from enforcing its Ordinance No. 1945 concerning the operation of motor busses, adopted May 23, 1925.1 Section 1 prohibits the operation \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 166]\n\u00a0\n of any busses (with an exception to be noted) on certain streets which lead into and through the business district. Section 2 prohibits any busses (with the same exception) from stopping anywhere on any street in the city, either \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 167]\n\u00a0\n to load or to discharge passengers, but reserves to the board of public works authority to grant, from time to time, permission, for periods not exceeding six months, to stop on portions of a few designated streets.\n For some time prior to the adoption of the ordinance, Schappi, Incorporated, had owned and operated a line of motor busses between Chicago and Hammond; another between Calumet City, Ill., and Hammond; and one from Calumet City through Hammond to East Chicago, Ind. The business is chiefly interstate; and on at least one of the lines is wholly interstate. The bill charges that for reasons there set forth the ordinance is void; and alleges that, if enforced, it will compel abandonment of all existing bus lines operated by the plaintiff. The case was heard upon an application for an interlocutory injunction. The District Court denied it without making any finding of fact and without an opinion or other statement of the reasons for its action. The decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which remanded the case 'with directions to enter a decree granting the injunction,' without specifying its scope. 11 F.(2d) 940. That court, also, made no finding on any controverted fact, save that it stated in its opinion 'that the record does not show any valid reason for the passage of such an ordinance because of congestion in the streets. The record shows that there was a parking privilege on both sides of the streets in question of not less than an hour's limit, very generally availed of.'\n The city of Hammond has an area of about 35 square miles; much of it sparsely settled. It has 250 miles of streets. Its population is 60,000. The terminal of the three Schappi lines is on private property in the heart of the business district. Schappi claims that the ordinance not only denies access to its existing terminal, but practically prevents its busses from coming within miles of the business section. The city concedes that the ordi- \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 168]\n\u00a0\n nance prohibits the continued operation of Schappi busses over their existing routes. It urges that, despite the prohibition of section 1 of the ordinance, Schappi busses might use other streets which would bring them within a short distance of the business district, and that it might, under section 2, secure permits to stop for loading and unloading which would adequately serve its purposes.\n The city asserts that the purpose of the ordinance is to prevent congestion of traffic and to promote safety. Schappi insists that there is no congestion, even in the business district, except such as results, at times, from the passing of railroad trains at grade and from the allowance of unreasonable parking privileges; that the prohibition by section 2 of stopping to load or unload passengers is obviously arbitrary; and that the real purpose of the ordinance is disclosed by section 3 which provides that it shall not 'be construed to impair the obligation of any contract to which the city is a party under which motor vehicles are now operated for hire within the city.' It appears that, under a contract made by the city in 1924, the Calumet Motor Coach Company is authorized, for a period of 25 years, to run its coaches on any street of the city and to stop on any street in order to load or discharge passengers. Schappi asserts that the only purpose of the city in adopting the ordinance was to protect the Calumet Company from the competition of other bus lines. That company has, among other lines, one between Chicago and the business district of Hammond.\n The issues of law are as serious and as numerous as those of fact. Schappi contends that the city lacked power to adopt any ordinance dealing with the subject, because by Act of March 4, 1925, Indiana General Assembly, pp. 138-142, and Act of March 14, 1925, Indiana General Assembly, pp. 570-607, the power to authorize use of the highways by motor busses was vested in the \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 169]\n\u00a0\n Public Service Commission and Schappi had obtained from it certificates of public convenience and necessity specifically authorizing the use of the existing routes. Schappi contends further that, even if the city possessed the power to deal with the general subject, this ordinance is void, under other state statutes and under the Constitution of the state, because it is unreasonable, arbitrary, and grossly discriminatory. And Schappi claims that, regardless of any power which state statutes may have purported to confer upon the city, the ordinance is void under the commerce clause, because all of its busses are operated in interstate commerce and the business is chiefly interstate, although some of the busses carry some intrastate passengers. Rights under the Fourteenth Amendment also were asserted.\n The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals states that the ordinance must be sustained, if at all, as a police regulation; that, as such, it was clearly discriminatory; and that it must be held void on that ground. Whether the invalidity results from the provisions of a state statute, or from the Constitution of the state, or from the Fourteenth Amendment is not stated. The court did not discuss the statutory powers of the city, declined to consider the effect of the recent state legislation particularly relied upon by the plaintiff, and did not even mention claims urged under the commerce clause. If, as Schappi contends, the ordinance is void under the state law, there is no occasion to consider whether it violates the federal Constitution and there could be no propriety in doing so. Whether it is void under the law of Indiana involves questions upon which this court should not be called upon to pass without the aid which discussion by members of the lower courts familiar with the local law would afford.\n On the other hand, if it should become necessary to consider Schappi's rights under the commerce clause, it is \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 170]\n\u00a0\n not fitting that these should be passed upon by this court upon the present record and at this stage of the proceedings.

R. 1105; Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A. L. R. 286; George W. Bush & Sons Co. v. Maloy, \n267 \nU.S. 317\n, 45 S.

Ct. 298; Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 47 S. Ct. 548; and its power to require users to contribute to the cost and upkeep, Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S. Ct. 702, have been settled by these recent decisions. \n2\n But the facts here alleged may, if established, require the application of those principles to conditions differing materially from any heretofore passed upon by this Court.\n The contentions made in the briefs and arguments suggest, among other questions, the following: Where there is congestion of city streets sufficient to justify some limitation of the number of motor vehicles to be operated thereon as common carriers, or some prohibition of stops to load or unload passengers, may the limitation or prohibition be applied to some vehicles used wholly or partly in interstate commerce while, at the same time, vehicles of like character, including many that are engaged solely in local, or intrastate, commerce are not subjected thereto? Is the right in the premises to which interstate carriers would otherwise be entitled, affected by the fact that, prior to the establishment of the interstate lines, \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 171]\n\u00a0\n the city had granted to a local carrier, by contract or franchise, the unlimited right to use all the streets of the city, and that elimination of the interstate vehicles would put an end to the congestion experienced? May the city's right to limit the number of vehicles, and to prohibit stops to load or unload passengers, be exercised in such a way as to allocate streets on which motor traffic is more profitable exclusively to the local lines and to allocate streets on which the traffic is less profitable to the lines engaged wholly, or partly, in interstate commerce? Is limitation of the number of vehicles, or prohibition of stops to load or unload passengers, of carriers engaged wholly, or partly, in interstate commerce, justifiable, where the congestion could be obviated by denying to private carriers existing parking privileges or by curtailing those so enjoyed? Are the rights of the interstate carrier in the premises dependent, in any respect, upon the dates of the establishment of its lines, as compared with the dates of the establishment of the lines of the local carrier?\n These questions have not, so far as appears, been considered by either of the lower courts. The facts essential to their determination have not been found by either court. And the evidence in the record is not of such a character that findings could now be made with confidence. The answer denied many of the material allegations of the bill. The evidence consists of the pleadings and affidavits. The pleadings are confusing. The affidavits are silent as to some facts of legal significance, lack definiteness as to some matters, and present serious conflicts on issues of facts that may be decisive. For aught that appears, the lower courts may have differed in their decisions solely because they differed as to conclusions of fact. Before any of the questions suggested, which are both novel and of far reaching importance, are passed \n\n[275 U.S. 164, 172]\n\u00a0\n upon by this court, the facts essential to their decision should be definitely found by the lower courts upon adequate evidence.\n There is an added reason why this court should not now make the findings of fact or rulings of law involved in these contentions. The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in assuming, as its opinion discloses, that the case had been submitted below as upon final hearing; and that the appeal before it was from a final decree dismissing the bill. The appeal was from the interlocutory decree denying the preliminary injunction, and the record discloses no later proceedings in the District Court. The case was not yet ripe for final disposition by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Compare Eagle Glass & Mfg. Co. v. Rowe, \n245 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 38 S. Ct. 80. Findings and rulings, if now made on the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing on the application for the temporary injunction, might be rendered of no avail by the presentation of other or additional evidence when the case comes on for final hearing.\n Under these circumstances, we deem it proper that, without costs in this court to either party, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals be modified, by recognizing that the decree in the District Court was only interlocutory, by directing an injunction pending the suit, and by remanding the cause to the District Court for proceedings on final hearing, with liberty to that court, among other things, to allow amendment of the pleadings. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Decree modified and cause remanded to District Court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No. 1945.\n An ordinance regulating and routing certain vehicles for hire and prohibiting their use of certain streets within the city of Hammond.

Code,  614-84 to 614-102), provides that a motor transportation company desiring to operate within the state shall apply to the Public Utilities Commission for a certificate so to do, and shall not begin to operate without first obtaining it; also that such a company must pay, at the time of the issuance of the certificate and annually thereafter, a tax graduated according \n\n[274 U.S. 554, 556]\n\u00a0\n to the number and capacity of the vehicles used. Sections 614-87, 614-94.\n Clark and Riggs operate as common carriers a motor truck line between Aurora, Ind., and Cincinnati, Ohio, exclusively in interstate commerce. They ignored the provisions of the act, and operated without applying for a certificate or paying the tax. The they brought this suit, in the federal court for southern Ohio, to enjoin the commission from enforcing as against them the provisions of the act. The case was heard in the District Court before three judges on final hearing, under section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925 307, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A. L. R. the act calls the certificate one of 'public convenience and necessity,' the commission had recognized, before this suit was begun, that, under Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A.L.R. 286, and Bush v. Maloy, \n267 \nU.S. 317\n, 45 S. Ct. 326, 327, it had no discretion where the carrier was engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, and was willing to grant to plaintiffs a certificate upon application and compliance with other provisions of the law. See Cannon Ball Transportation Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 113 Ohio St. 565, 567, 149 N. E. 713. The bill was dismissed. It is here on direct appeal. This court has jurisdiction, as an interlocutory injunction had been applied for and a restraining order issued. Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n272 U.S. 317\n, 320-321, 47 S. Ct. 105; Smith v. Wilson, No. 648, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S. Ct. 385, decided February 21, 1927\n\n\n The plaintiffs claim that, as applied to them, the act violates the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. They insist that, as they are engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, they are not subject to regulation by the state; that it is without power to require that before using its highways they apply for and obtain a certificate; and that it is also without power to impose, in addition to the annual license fee demanded of all persons using automobiles on the highways, a tax upon them, under \n\n[274 U.S. 554, 557]\n\u00a0\n section 614-94, for the maintenance and repair of the highways and for the administration and enforcement of the laws governing the use of the same. The contrary is settled. The highways are public property. Users of them, although engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, are subject to regulation by the state to ensure safety and convenience and the conservation of the highways. Morris v. Duby, No. 372, \n274 \nU.S. 135\n, 47 S. Ct. 548 decided April 18, 1927; Hess v. Pawloski (No. 263) \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S. Ct. 632, decided May 16, 1927. Users of them, although engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, may be required to contribute to their cost and upkeep. Common carriers for hire, who make the highways their place of business, may properly be charged an extra tax for such use. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30. Compare packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 144\n, 44 S. Ct. 257.\n There is no suggestion that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce. Nor is it suggested that the tax is so large as to obstruct interstate commerce. It is said that all of the tax is not used for maintenance and repair of the highways; that some of it is used for defraying the expenses of the commission in the administration or enforcement of the act, and some for other purposes. This, if true, is immaterial. Since the tax is assessed for a proper purpose and is not objectionable in amount, the use to which the proceeds are put is not a matter which concerns the plaintiffs.\n Plaintiffs urge that the decree should be reversed because of the provision in the act concerning insurance. The act provides that no certificate shall issue until a policy covering liability and cargo insurance has been filed with the commission. Section 614-99. The lower court held that, under Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570\n, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105, this provision could not be applied to exclusively interstate carriers, Red Ball Transit Co. v. Marshall (D. C.) 8 F. (2d) 635, 639; and counsel for the com- \n\n[274 U.S. 554, 558]\n\u00a0\n mission stated in this court that the requirement for insurance would not be insisted upon. Plaintiffs urge that because this was not conceded at the outset, it was error to deny the injunction. The circumstances were such that it was clearly within the discretion of the court to decline to issue an injunction; and since an injunction was the only relief sought, it properly dismissed the bill. Compare Chicago G. W. Ry. Co. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 100\n, 101 S., 45 S. Ct. 55. The plaintiffs did not apply for a certificate or offer to pay the taxes. They refused or failed to do so, not because insurance was demanded, but because of their belief that, being engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, they could not be required to apply for a certificate or to pay the tax. Their claim was unfounded. Moreover, the act made each section and part thereof independent and declared that 'the holding of any section or part thereof to be void or ineffective for any cause shall not affect any other section or part thereof.' Section 614-102. And the act also provided that it should apply to interstate commerce only in so far as such regulation was permitted by the federal Constitution. Section 614-101.\n It is not clear whether the liability insurance, for which the act provides, is against loss resulting to their persons from the applicant's negligence in using the highways within the state, or is for loss to passengers resulting from such negligence, or for both purposes. We have no occasion to consider whether under any suggested interpretation, liability insurance, as distinguished from insurance on the interstate cargo, may be required of a carrier engaged wholly in interstate commerce. Compare Hess v. Pawloski, supra. The decree dismissing the bill is affirmed, but without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs to seek appropriate relief by another suit if they should hereafter be required by the commission to comply with conditions or provisions not warranted by law.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLINE v.

St.  1215), from a final decree of the United States District Court of Colorado, three judges sitting, granting a permanent injunction against the enforcement by a state officer of a state law on the ground of its unconstitutionality. The bill was brought by the Frink Dairy Company, the Windsor Farm Dairy Company, and the Climax Dairy Company, corporations of Colorado, and H. Brown Cannon, Clarence Frink, A. T. McClintock, and Morris Robinson, citizens and residents of the same state, against Foster Cline, the district attorney for the city and county of Denver, Colo.\n The bill alleges that the suit involves for decision the question of the validity under the Constitution of the United States of what is known as the Colorado Anti-Trust Act, being chapter 161 of the Session Laws of the State of Colorado for 1913, approved April 7th of that \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n year. It avers that the three dairy companies have been separately conducting for years, in Danver, Colo., and its vicinity, the sale and distribution of milk, butter, and all manner of dairy products; that each has invested in its business more than $100,000; that they are also engaged in interstate commerce, buying and selling from without the limits of the state; that the individual plaintiffs, Connon, Frink, and Morrison, are respectively officers and stockholders of the three plaintiff companies; that McClintock, the other individual plaintiff, is an officer and stockholder of the Beatrice Creamery Company, a corporation of Delaware, also in the dairy business in Denver; that the individual plaintiffs, experienced dairymen, by painstaking effort, fair dealing, and careful management, have gained thousands of customers and a well- established trade; and that their companies, in addition to their tangible property and assets, have good wills of great value. The bill sets out in full the Colorado anti-trust law, which punishes as a crime combinations of persons and corporations to restrain trade or commerce, with certain exceptions, and makes it the duty of the defendant, the district attorney, to prosecute alleged violations thereof, and to institute actions for forfeiture of charters of associations engaged therein. All contracts violating the act are avoided; violation of the act is made a good defense to a suit for merchandise that was sold in pursuance of a combination under it; and a right of action for damages against the combiners is given to any one injured by the combination. One charge of the bill, among others, is that the act violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, in that it deprives the plaintiffs of their liberty without due process of law, because it is indefinite and uncertain, and fails to fix any informing standard of criminality.\n The bill alleges that Foster Cline, the defendant, in his capacity as district attorney of Denver city and \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n county, has been, and still is, claiming that the plaintiffs and their competitors have been and now are acting in violation of the anti-trust law; that he has caused an information to be filed in the criminal division of the district court of the city and county of Denver, in which the plaintiffs and the beatrice Creamery Company, a Delaware corporation, are charged with conspiracy to violate the Anti-Trust Act; that he expects to press the case to trial; that since the case was instituted the grand jury has been in session, and many witnesses summoned and questioned about the plaintiffs' milk business; that the defendant Cline has threatened to, and unless restrained by the court will, institute further prosecutions, file further informations, and attempt to procure indictments of the plaintiffs by the grand jury; and that Cline by this multiplicity of criminal suits and prosecutions, as well as by the civil suits for forfeiture of the corporate plaintiffs' charters he has threatened to bring, has already inflicted serious loss to the businesses and properties of the plaintiffs, and that they will be irreparably and immeasureably damaged thereby unless he is restrained.\n A motion to dismiss was made by the defendant, on the ground that the bill presented no case for equitable relief. On the hearing before the three judges, a preliminary injunction was issued, and the motion to dismiss was denied. The defendant standing upon his motion to dismiss and declining to plead further, a decree for a permanent injunction was entered, and this is an appeal from that decree.\n The first question is whether the practice and precedents in equity justified the granting of relief by injunction, where one criminal prosecution had been begun, and where many others, together with suits for forfeiture of corporate franchises, were threatened. The general rule is that a court of equity is without jurisdiction to restrain criminal proceedings to try the same right that is in issue \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n before it; but an exception to this rule exists when the prevention of such prosecutions under alleged unconstitutional enactments is essential to the safeguarding of rights of property, and when the circumstances are exceptional and the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate.

Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S. Ct. 15; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Davis & Farnum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 \nU.S. 207, 218\n, 23 S. Ct. 498; Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 \nU.S. 223, 236\n, 241 S., 25 S. Ct. 18; In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 209\n, 211 S., 8 S. Ct. 482.\n The affidavits in support of the bill were very full in their showing that the district attorney by his action and threats had already greatly injured their properties and their businesses. They present a case in which the question of the validity of the act under which, if invalid, great injuries to properties and businesses are being unjustly inflicted should be promptly settled. We think the basis for equitable jurisdiction is made sufficiently clear.\n It is objected, however, that the injunction cannot be supported under the authorities, in so far as it is directed against actual proceedings pending in the criminal court. One of the District Judges below dissented from this part of the decree. Of course, the injunction is not only against actual prosecution, but is also against a multiplicity of future suits and the threatened proceedings for forfeiture, by which the Attorney General proposes to end the businesses of all the plaintiffs, and the objection would only lead to a narrowing of the decree. The majority in the District Court were influenced by a remark of this court in Davis & Farnum Co. v. Los Angeles, supra, in speaking of a bill to restrain invasion of rights of property by the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, in which the court said:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n 'It would seem that, if there were jurisdiction in a court of equity to enjoin the invasion of property rights through the instrumentality of an unconstitutional law, that jurisdiction would not be ousted by the fact that the state had chosen to assert its power to enforce such law by indictment or other criminal proceeding.'\n This semble does not seem to have received the approval of the court in Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A . (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764, where it was said:\n'It is further objected (and the objection really forms part of the contention that the state cannot be sued) that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to enjoin criminal proceedings, by indictment or otherwise, under the state law. This, as a general rule, is true. But there are exceptions. When such indictment or proceeding is brought to enforce an alleged unconstitutional statute, which is the subject- matter of inquiry in a suit already pending in a federal court, the latter court having first obtained jurisdiction over the subject- matter, has the right, in both civil and criminal cases, to hold and maintain such jurisdiction, to the exclusion of all other courts, until its duty is fully performed. Prout v. Starr, \n188 U.S. 537\n, 544 ( 23 S. Ct. 398). But the federal court cannot, of course interfere in a case where the proceedings were already pending in a state court. Taylor v. Taintor, 16 Wall. 366, 370 (21 L. Ed. 287 ); Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 U.S. 148\n (19 S. Ct. 119).'\n\n We therefore agree with the view of the dissenting judge that the injunction is too broad, in so far as it restrains proceedings actually pending, and that it must be accordingly modified.\n This brings us to the consideration of the constitutionality of the Anti-Trust Act. We think that the act is so vague and uncertain in its description of what shall constitute its criminal violations that it is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is this respect violates due process and cannot be distinguished from the case \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n of United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045. The law there under consideration was the fourth section of the Lever Act re-enacted in 1919. Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80,  2, 41 Stat. 297 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/8 ff). It provided as follows:\n'That it is hereby made unlawful for any person willfully ... to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries; to conspire, combine, agree, or arrange with any other person, ... to exact excessive prices for any necessaries. ... Any person violating any of the provisions of this section upon conviction thereof shall be fined not exceeding $5,000 or be imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.'\n\n This court said:\n'The sole remaining inquiry, therefore, is the certainty or uncertainty of the text in question; that is, whether the words, 'That it is hereby made unlawful for any person willfully ... to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries,' constituted a fixing by Congress of an ascertainable standard of guilt and are adequate to inform persons accused of violation thereof of the nature and cause of the accusation against them. That they are not, we are of opinion, so clearly results from their mere statement as to render elaboration on the subject wholly unnecessary. Observe that the section forbids no specific or definite act. It confines the subject-matter of the investigation which it authorizes to no element essentially inhering in the transaction as to which it provides. It leaves open, therefore, the widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against. In fact, we see no reason to doubt the soundness of the observation of the court below, in its opinion, to the effect \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 455]\n\u00a0\n that, to attempt to enforce the section would be the exact equivalent of an effort to carry out a statute which in terms merely penalized and punished all acts detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable in the estimation of the court and jury.'\n\n The opinion cites in support of its conclusion, United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214, 219\n, 220 S.; United States v. Brewer, \n139 \nU.S. 278, 288\n, 11 S. Ct. 538, 35 L .ed. 190; Todd v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 15 S. Ct. 889; United States v.

Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 34 S. Ct. 853; Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 635, 637\n, 34 S. Ct. 924; American Seeding Machine Co. v. Kentucky, \n236 \nU.S. 660, 662\n, 35 S. Ct. 456.\n The Colorado anti-trust law denounces conspiracies and combinations of persons and corporation, first, to create and carry out restrictions in trade or commerce preventing the full and free pursuit of any lawful business in the state; second, to increase or reduce the price of merchandise, products or commodities; third, to prevent competition in the making, transportation, sale or purchase of commodities or merchandise; fourth, to fix any standard of figures whereby the price shall be controlled or established; fifth, to make or execute any contract or agreement to bind the participants not to sell below a common standard, or to keep the price of the article at a fixed or graded figure, or establish or settle the price between themselves so as to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, or to pool, combine, or untie any interest they may have in such business of making, selling or transporting that the price of the article may be affected. The foregoing language sufficiently describes \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 456]\n\u00a0\n for purposes of a criminal statute the acts which it intends to punish, but the Colorado law does not stop with that. It is accompanied by two provisos which materially affect its purport and effect. They are as follows:\n'And all such combinations are hereby declared to be against public policy, unlawful and void: Provided, that no agreement or association shall be deemed to be unlawful or within the provisions of this act, the object and purposes of which are to conduct operations at a reasonable profit or to market at a reasonable profit those products which cannot otherwise be so marketed: Provided, further that it shall not be deemed to be unlawful, or within the provisions of this act, for persons, firms, or corporations engaged in the business of selling or manufacturing commodities of a similar or like character to employ, form, organize or own any interest in any association, firm or corporation, having as its object or purpose the transportation, marketing or delivering of such commodities. ...' Section 1.\n\n The effect of the first proviso is that combinations, with the purposes defined in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs of section 1, and declared thereby to be unlawful and void, are not to be regarded as unlawful if their purpose shall be to obtain only a reasonable profit in such products or merchandise as can not yield a reasonable profit except by marketing them under the combinations previously condemned. The second is like the first in declaring that it shall not be unlawful or within the condemnatory provisions of the act for persons engaged in the business of selling or manufacturing commodities of a class that can only be dealt with at a reasonable profit by such previously condemned trust methods, to employ or own interests in an association having as its object the transportation, marketing, or delivering of such commodities at a reasonable profit. These provisos make the line \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 457]\n\u00a0\n between lawfulness and criminality to depend upon, first, what commodities need to be handled according to the trust methods condemned in the first part of the act to enable those engaged in dealing in them to secure a reasonable profit therefrom; second, to determine what generally would be a reasonable profit for such a business; and, third, what would be a reasonable profit for the defendant under the circumstances of his particular business. It would, therefore, be a complete defense for the defendant to prove in this case that it is impossible to sell milk or milk products, except by trust methods and make a reasonable profit, if he also showed that by such methods he had in fact only made a reasonable profit.\n We have examined the opinions of the Supreme Court of Colorado in reference to the construction and operation of these provisos in the Colorado anti-trust law (Campbell v. People, 72 Colo. 213, 210 P. 841; Johnson v. People, 72 Colo. 218, 210 P. 843; People v. Apostolos, 73 Colo. 71; 213 P. 331), and we find nothing there which is in conflict with our construction of them. Such an exception in the statute leaves the whole statute without a fixed standard of guilt in an adjudication affecting the liberty of the one accused. An attempt to enforce the section will be to penalize and punish all combinations in restraint of trade in a commodity when in the judgment of the court and jury they are not necessary to enable those engaged in it to make it reasonably profitable, but not otherwise. Such a basis for judgment of a crime would be more impracticable and complicated than the much simpler question in the Cohen Grocery Case, whether a price charged was unreasonable or excessive. The real issue which the proviso would submit to the jury would be legislative, not judicial. To compel defendants to guess on the peril of an indictment whether one or more of the restrictions of the statute will destroy all profit or \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 458]\n\u00a0\n reduce it below what would be reasonable, would tax the human ingenuity in much the same way as that which this court refused to allow as a proper standard of criminality in International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 222\n, 223 S., 34 S. Ct. 853\n\n\n The Cohen Case was a violation of a federal law and involved the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the first providing that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, and the second that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. We are now considering a case of state legislation and threatened prosecutions in a state court where only the Fourteenth Amendment applies, but that requires that there should be due process of law and this certainly imposes upon a state an obligation to frame its criminal statutes so that those to whom they are addressed may know what standard of conduct is intended to be required. And such is the effect of our cases. Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385\n, 46 S. Ct. 126; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216\n, 34 S. Ct. 853; Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 364\n, 34 S. Ct. 924; American Seeding Machine Co. v. Kentucky, \n236 \nU.S. 660\n, 35 S. Ct. 456; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 86\n, 29 S. Ct. 220; Fox v.

Ct. 304.\n In the latest of the foregoing cases, Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 291\n, 46 S. Ct. 126, the validity of a statute of Oklahoma providing that not more than the current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work was performed should be paid to laborers, workmen, mechanics, prison guards, janitors in public institutions, or other persons so employed by and on behalf \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 459]\n\u00a0\n of the state, was before us. We held that the provision contained no ascertainable standard of guilt; that it could not be determined with any degree of certainty what sum constituted a current wage in such locality, because the term 'locality' under the circumstances of that case was fatally vague and uncertain. We said (page 391 (46 S. Ct. 127)):\n'The terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties is a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law. ...\n\n'The question whether given legislative enactments have been thus wanting in certainty has frequently been before this court. In some of the cases the statutes involved were upheld; in others, declared invalid. The precise point of differentiation in some instances in not easy of statement; but it will be enough for present purposes to say generally that the decisions of the court, upholding statutes as sufficiently certain, rested upon the conclusion that they employed words or phrases having a technical or other special meaning, well enough known to enable those within their reach to correctly apply them (Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 45 S. Ct. 141; Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 323), or a well-settled common-law meaning, notwithstanding an element of degree in the definition as to which estimates might differ (Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 33 S. Ct. 780; International Harvester Company v. Kentucky, supra, at page 223 (34 S. Ct. 853)), or, as broadly stated by Mr. Chief Justice White in United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81, 92\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 301, 14 A. L. R. 1045, that, for reasons found to result either from the text \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 460]\n\u00a0\n of the statutes involved or the subjects with which they dealt, a standard of some sort was afforded.'\n\n The chief authority upon which counsel for the appellant rely is the case of Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 33 S. Ct. 780. That case involved the question whether the Sherman Anti-Trust Law ( Comp. St.  8820 et seq.), in making criminal every contract and all monopolies in restraint of interstate trade or commerce, fixed a permissible and ascertainable standard of guilt. It was held that it did. Because this Colorado act is an anti-trust law, punishing with even more detail of description all combinations in restraint of trade in Colorado, with the excepting provisos, it is supposed that the Nash Case has direct application and supports the claim of validity for the act. It is first to be noted that the court in its consideration of the Cohen Case had before it the Nash Case, and found nothing in that case inconsistent with its Cohen Case ruling.\n In the Nash Case we held that the commonlaw precedents as to what constituted an undue restraint of trade were quite specific enough to advise one engaged in interstate trade and commerce what he could and could not do under the statute. In commenting on and affirming the Nash Case, this court said in International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 223\n, 34 S. Ct. 853, 855 (58 L. Ed. 1284):\n'The conditions are as permanent as anything human, and a great body of precedents on the civil side, coupled with familiar practice, make it comparatively easy ... to keep to what is safe.'\n\n The common-law precedents as to forbidden and permissible restraints of trade were reviewed at great length by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in a case under the federal Anti-Trust Act in United States v. Addyston Pipe Co. (C. C. A.) 85 F. 271, 46 L. R. A. 122. It subsequently came to this court, and is reported in \n175 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S. Ct. 96. The federal Anti-Trust Act declares every contract, combination in the form of trust or other \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 461]\n\u00a0\n wise, or conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade to be illegal and every one taking part in it to be guilty of a misdemeanor. In United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290\n, 17 S. Ct. 540, and United States v. Joint Traffic Association, \n171 \nU.S. 505\n, 19 S. Ct. 25, the opinions of the court left the impression among many that every contract in restraint of trade, no matter whether lawful and reasonable or void and unenforceable at common law, was within the penalty of the statute. Such a conclusion was not necessary to the decision, and it was quite evident, when the opinions were analyzed, that it was recognized in their text that there were incidental restraints of trade that the statute was not intended to cover. This was made clear by the later decision in Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, \n200 \nU.S. 179\n, 26 S. Ct. 208. The view was fully confirmed in United States v. Standard Oil Co., \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734, and United States v. American Tobacco Co ., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S. Ct. 632, where the language of the federal statute was read in the light of the common law, and in accordance with its reason, and was construed not to penalize such partial restraints of trade as at common law were not only permitted, but were promoted in the interest of the freedom of trade itself.\n The review of the many common-law precedents as to due and undue restraints of trade shows that in only one or two cases, and those not well considered, was there left to the court or jury as a criterion of the validity of a restraint of trade the reasonableness of the prices fixed or the profit realized under it.\n The Addyston Case, supra, which involved a scheme for fixing prices, this court quoted with approval the following passage from the lower court's opinion (85 F. 271, 293):\n'... The affiants say that, in their opinion, the prices at which pipe has been sold by defendants have been reasonable. We do not think the issue an impor- \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 462]\n\u00a0\n tant one, because, as already stated, we do not think that at common law there is any question of reasonableness open to the courts with reference to such a contract.'\n\n In the same case the Circuit Court of Appeals, referring to cases in restraint of trade, said (pages 283 and 284):\n'But these cases all involved contracts in which the covenant in restrain of trade was ancillary to the main and lawful purpose of the contract, and was necessary to the protection of the covenantee in the carrying out of that main purpose. They do not manifest any general disposition on the part of the courts to be more liberal in supporting contracts having their sole object the restraint of trade than did the courts of an earlier time. It is true that there are some cases in which the courts, mistaking, as we conceive, the proper limits of the relaxation of the rule for determining the unreasonableness of restraints of trade, have set sail on a sea of doubt, and have assumed the power to say, in respect to contracts which have no other purpose and no other consideration on either side than the mutual restraint of the parties, how much restraint ... is in the public interest, and how much is not. The manifest danger in the administration of justice according to so shifting, vague, and indeterminate a standard would seem to be a strong reason against adopting it.'\n\n This same view, when directed to the question of judging restraints of trade by reference to reasonableness of prices effected by the restraint is confirmed by the latest decision of this court on the subject in United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S. Ct. 377 (February 21, 1927), where it was said:\n'The aim and result of every price-fixing agreement, if effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The power to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not, involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable prices. The reasonable price fixed \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 463]\n\u00a0\n to-day may through economic and business changes become the unreasonable price of to-morrow. Once established, it may be maintained unchanged because of the absence of competition secured by the agreement for a price reasonable when fixed. Agreements which create such potential power may well be held to be in themselves unreasonable or unlawful restraints, without the necessity of minute inquiry whether a particular price is reasonable or unreasonable as fixed and without placing on the government in enforcing the Sherman law the burden of ascertaining from day to day whether it has become unreasonable through the mere variation of economic conditions. Moreover, in the absence of express legislation requiring it, we should hesitate to adopt a construction making the difference between legal and illegal conduct in the field of business relations depend upon so uncertain a test as whether prices are reasonable-a determination which can be satisfactorily made only after a complete survey of our economic organization and a choice between rival philosophies.'\n\n This review showing what was the standard of criminality in the federal anti-trust law, indicates clearly that the decision in the Cohen Grocery Case was not inconsistent with the Nash Case, because the latter did not relate to the reasonableness or excessiveness of prices charged for necessaries without more as a basis for criminality, while the former plainly did. The same reasons show that there is nothing inconsistent between the Cohen Case and that of Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 86\n, 29 S. Ct. 220.\n The principle of due process of law requiring reasonable certainty of description in fixing a standard for exacting obedience from a person in advance has application as well in civil as in criminal legislation (Small Co. v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n267 \nU.S. 233, 238\n, 45 S. Ct. 295 et seq.), but the fact that it is often necessary to investi- \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 464]\n\u00a0\n gate and decide certain questions in civil cases is not controlling or persuasive as to whether persons may be held to civil or criminal liability for not deciding them rightly in advance. On questions of confiscatory rates for public utilities, for instance, courts must examine in great detail the circumstances and reach a conclusion as to a reasonable profit. But this does not justify in such a case holding the average member of society in advance to a rule of conduct measured by his judgment and action in respect to what is a reasonable price or a reasonable profit. It is true that on an issue like negligence-i, e., a rule of conduct for the average man in the avoiding injury to his neighbors-every one may be held to observe it either on the civil or criminal side of the court. It is a standard of human conduct which all are reasonably charged with knowing and which must be enforced against every one in order that society can safely exist. We said in the Nash Case ( page 377, 33 S. Ct. 781):\n'But, apart from the common law as to restraint of trade thus taken up by the statute, the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree. If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a short imprisonment, as here; he may incur the penalty of death. 'An act causing death may be murder, manslaughter, or misadventure, according to the degree of danger attending it' by common experience in the circumstances known to the actor. ... 'The criterion in such cases is to examine whether common social duty would under the circumstances, have suggested a more circumspect conduct.' 1 East, P. C. 262.'\n\n Following the authority in the Nash Case, we sustained in Miller v. Oregon, per curiam, January 17, 1927, \n273 \nU.S. 657\n, 47 S. Ct. 344, 71 L. Ed. -, a conviction of manslaughter under a statute of Oregon, which made the following rule of conduct a standard of criminality:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 445, 465]\n\u00a0\n 'Every person operating a motor vehicle on the public highways of this state shall drive the same in a careful and prudent manner, not to exceed thirty miles per hour, and within the limit of incorporated cities and towns not to exceed twenty miles per hour, and at intersections and school houses not to exceed twelve miles per hour, and in no case at a rate of speed that will endanger the property of another, or the life and limb of any person.' Chapter 371, General Laws of Oregon 1921,  2, subd. 16.\n The indictment was framed under the last clause of this statute. Such standard for the driver of an automobile on a highway is one to which it is neither harsh nor arbitrary to hold those criminally who operate such a possibly dangerous instrument of locomotion, and who are or ought to be aware of what degree of care is necessary to avoid injury to others under the conditions that prevail on a highway. See Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S. Ct. 632, decided May 16, 1927.\n But it will not do to hold an average man to the peril of an indictment for the unwise exercise of his economic or business knowledge, involving so many factors of varying effect that neither the person to decide in advance nor the jury to try him after the fact can safely and certainly judge the result. When to a decision whether a certain amount of profit in a complicated business is reasonable is added that of determining whether detailed restriction of particular anti-trust legislation will prevent a reasonable profit in the case of a given commodity, we have an utterly impracticable standard for a jury's decision. A Legislature must fix the standard more simply and more definitely before a person must conform or a jury can act.\n We conclude that the anti-trust statute of Colorado is void, in that those who are prosecuted and convicted under it will be denied due process of law. \n\n[274 U.S. 445, 466]\n\u00a0\n The decree of District Court to enjoin proceedings which the defendant threatens to bring under the act against the plaintiffs should be affirmed, but the decree below is modified and reversed, so far as it purports to enjoin the defendant from proceeding further in prosecuting the information under that act against the plaintiffs now pending in the state criminal court.\n The decree is in part reversed and in part affirmed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMPANIA DE NAVEGACION v.

Aikins, both of San Francisco, Cal., and Barry Mohun, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas, hereafter to be called the Tobacco Company, brought this suit is the Court of First Instance in Manila to recover from the Philipine collector of internal revenue certain sums paid under protect as internal revenue taxes on insurance \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n premiums which the Tobacco Company during the year 1922, through its head office in Barcelona, Spain, paid to the Guardian Insurance Company of London, England, and to Le Comite des Assurances Maritimes de Paris, of Paris, France. These two insurance companies we shall hereafter designate as the London Company and the Paris Company. The case was heard on an agreed statement of facts. The Tobacco Company is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the kingdom of Spain and licensed to do business in the Philippine Islands, maintaining its chief office in the Islands in the city of Manila. During the year 1922 the Tobacco Company purchased and placed in its warehouses in the Philippines merchandise, and from time to time notified its head office in Barcelona of its value. The Tobacco Company, at its head office in Barcelona, then insured the merchandise against fire under open and running policies of insurance carried by it with the London Company, and paid premiums of 4,835.32 pesos. Subsequent to the purchase of the merchandise, the Tobacco Company from time to time shipped it to Europe, and by cable notified its head office in Barcelona of the value of the shipments. The head office thereupon insured with the Paris Company these shipments for and on behalf of the Tobacco Company against marine risks under open and running policies, premiums on which amounted during the year 1922 to 100,050.44 pesos, and the premiums thus paid were charged to the expense of the Tobacco Company at Manila. The London Company is licensed to do insurance business in the Philippine Islands and has an agent there. The Paris Company is not licensed to do business in the Philippines and has no agent there. Losses, if any, on these policies, were to be paid to the Tobacco Company by the London Company in London and by the Paris Company in Paris. The insurance effected was secured without the use of any agent, company, corpora- \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n tion, or other representative of the companies doing business in the Philippine Islands. The collector in 1923 assessed and collected from the Tobacco Company a tax of 1 per cent. upon the premiums paid by it to the London Company of 4,832.25 pesos, or 48.32 pesos, and on those paid by it to the Paris Company 100,050.44 pesos, or 1,000.50 pesos. These sums were paid under protest in writing. The protests were overruled on the 27th day of July, 1923, and on the 16th of August the plaintiff filed this action for the recovery of the taxes.\n The taxes were collected under section 192 of Act No. 2427, as amended by Act No. 2430, of the Statutes of the Philippines (9 Public Laws, 292). That section provides that it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation in the Philippines to procure, receive or forward applications for insurance in, or to issue or to deliver or accept policies of, or for, any company or companies not having been legally authorized to transact business in the Philippine Islands, and that any person or company violating this section shall be guilty of a penal offense and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of 200 pesos, or imprisonment for two months, or both in the discretion of the court. The section contains a proviso that insurance may be placed by authority of a certificate of the insurance commissioner to any regularly authorized fire or marine insurance agent of the Islands, subject to revocation at any time, permitting the person named therein to procure policies of insurance on risks located in the Philippine Islands in companies not authorized to transact business in the Philippine Islands. Before the agent named in the certificate shall procure any insurance in such company, it must be shown by affidavit that the person desiring insurance after diligent effort has been unable to procure in any of the companies authorized to do business in the Philippine Islands the amount of insurance necessary. \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n The agent is to make a yearly report to the collector of internal revenue of all premiums received by the company he represents under the previous authority, and he is to pay to the collector of internal revenue a tax equal to twice the tax imposed by section 79 of Act No. 2339 (i. e., 1 per cent. thereof), which tax shall be paid at the same time and be subject to the same penalty for delinquency as the tax imposed by Act No. 2339. 9 Public Laws of Philippine Islands, February 27, 1914, p. 296. It is provided further that the prohibitions of the section shall not prevent an owner of property from applying for and obtaining for himself policies in foreign companies in cases where he does not make use of an agent residing in the Philippine Islands. In such cases it shall be his duty to report to the insurance commissioner each case where the insurance has been effected and shall pay a tax of 1 per centum on premiums paid in the manner required by law of insurance companies, and shall be subject to the same penalties for failure to do so.\n The court of first instance sustained the validity of the tax as to each insurance company. The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirmed the judgment. Two judges of the latter court dissented on the ground that the tax violated the rule of uniformity, and was a denial of the equal protection of the law.\n The Philippine Organic Act (39 Stat. 545, 546, c. 416,  3 (48 USCA  1008; Comp. St.  3810)) by its section 3 imposes upon the Legislature of the Philippine Islands the same limitation by which the Fourteenth Amendment restrains the states of the Union, to wit, that no law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any person the equal protection of the laws. The question of the validity of the tax on the premiums differs in respect to those paid the two insurance companies.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n Coming, then, to the tax on the premiums paid to the Paris Company, the contract of insurance on which the premium was paid was made at Barcelona in Spain, the headquarters of the Tobacco Company, between the Tobacco Company and the Paris Company, and any losses arising thereunder were to be paid in Paris. The Paris Company had no communication whatever with any one in the Philippine Islands. The collection of this tax involves an exaction upon a company of Spain lawfully doing business in the Philippine Islands effected by reason of a contract made by that company with a company in Paris on merchandise shipped from the Philippine Islands for delivery in Barcelona. It is an imposition upon a contract not made in the Philippines, and having no situs there, and to be measured by money paid as premium in Paris, with the place of payment of loss, if any, in Paris. We are very clear that the contract and the premiums paid under it are not within the jurisdiction of the government of the Philippine Islands. The taxpayer, however, is resident in the Philippine Islands, and within the governmental jurisdiction of those Islands. Its property in the Islands and its agents doing business there are within the reach of the government of the Islands. The company may be compelled to pay what the government in its quasi sovereignty chooses to exact as a matter of power, unless restrained by law. A legal restriction upon the taxing power of the Philippine government over citizens and residents of the Islands is found in the liberty secured by the Organic Act which embraces the right to make contracts and accumulate property and do business outside of the Philippine Islands and beyond its jurisdiction without prohibition, regulation, or governmental exaction.\n In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n, 17 S. Ct. 427, a law of Louisiana provided that any person who should do any act in Louisiana to effect for himself or for another, \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n insurance on property then in that state in any marine insurance company which had not complied in all respects with the laws of the state should be subject to a fine of $1,000 for each offense. Allgeyer was sued for violating the statute, because he had mailed a letter in New Orleans to the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company of New York advising that company of a shipment of 100 bales of cotton to foreign ports, with bill of lading and an insurance certificate in accordance with the terms of an open marine policy of its issuing. Action was brought to recover for three such violations of the act the sum of $3,000. The answer was that the act was unconstitutional, in that it deprived the defendant of its liberty without due process of law; that the business concerning which the defendants were sought to be made liable and the contracts made in reference to such business were beyond the jurisdiction of the state, because the contract of insurance was made with an insurance company in the state of New York, where the premiums were to be paid and where the losses thereunder, if any, were to be paid. This court held that citizens of a state had a right to contract outside the state for insurance on their property a right of which the state Legislature could not deprive them, because coming within the 'liberty,' protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the letter sent to the company was a proper act, which the state Legislature had no right to prevent; this even though the property which was the subject of the insurance had been within the state.\n On the authority of the Allgeyer Case, this court decided St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. State of Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n, 43 S. Ct. 125. That was a suit by the state of Arkansas against the Compress Company, a corporation of Missouri authorized to do business in Arkansas. It was brought to recover 5 per cent. on the gross premiums paid by the Compress Company for insurance upon its property \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n in Arkansas to companies not authorized to do business in that state. A statute of Arkansas in terms imposed a liability for this 5 per cent. as a tax. The answer alleged, and the proof showed, that the policies were contracted for, delivered and paid in St. Louis, Mo., where the rates were less than those charged by companies authorized to do business in Arkansas. The plaintiff demurred. The Supreme Court of the state justified the imposition as an occupation tax. This court said:\n'The short question is whether this so-called tax is saved because of the name given to it by the statute, when it has been decided in Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n, 17 S. Ct. 427, that the imposition of a round sum, called a fine, for doing the same thing, called an offense, is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is argued that there is a distinction because the Louisiana statute prohibits (by implication) what this statute permits. But that distinction, apart from some relatively insignificant collateral consequences, is merely in the amount of the detriment imposed upon doing the act. ... Here it is 5 per cent. upon the premiums, which is 3 per cent. more than is charged for insuring in authorized companies. Each is a prohibition to the extent of the payment required. The Arkansas tax manifests no less plainly than the Louisiana fine a purpose to discourage insuring in companies that do not pay tribute to the state. This case is stronger than that of Allgeyer, in that here no act was done within the state, whereas there a letter constituting a step in the contract was posted within the jurisdiction. It is true that the state may regulate the activities of foreign corporations within the state, but it cannot regulate or interfere with what they do outside.'\n\n The authority of these cases is controlling in disposing of the one before us. The effect of them is that, as a state is forbidden to deprive a person of his liberty without due process of law, it may not compel any one within its juris- \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n diction to pay tribute to it for contracts or money paid to secure the benefit of contracts made and to be performed outside of the state.\n But it is said that these two cases were really cases of penalties, although in the Compress Company Case the law called the imposition an occupation tax. We are unable to see any sound distinction between the imposition of a so-called tax and the imposition of a fine in such a case. A so-called tax is just as much an interference with the liberty of contract as is a penalty by fine, where the subject-matter giving rise to the imposition is beyond the jurisdiction of the state. Reference was made in the Compress Case to the fact that that which was imposed was larger than would have been the tax in the state if all parties had been in the state and the contract had been made there, but the decision itself clearly does not depend for its basis upon discrimination as between a tax and a prohibition or the amount of it. This court said, in comparing the Allgeyer Case and the Compress Case:\n'In Louisiana the detriment was $1,000. Here it is 5 per cent. upon the premiums, which is 3 per cent. more than is charged for insuring in authorized companies. Each is a prohibition to the extent of the payment required. The Arkansas tax manifest no less plainly than the Louisiana fine a purpose to discourage insuring in companies that do not pay tribute to the state.'\n\n And that is just what this tax is for. Even though it is only equal to the tax upon normal premiums paid in the Philippine Islands, it is imposed for the purpose of discouraging insurance in companies that do not pay tribute to the state because out of its taxing or penalizing jurisdiction. As the language above quoted from the opinion in the Compress Case shows, the action of Arkansas was invalid, because of its attempt 'to regulate' the conduct of the Compress Company in respect to a matter not \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n within its local jurisdiction. Taxation is regulation just as prohibition is.\n It is sought to take this case out of the Allgeyer and the Compress Cases by reference to Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Pennsylvania, \n238 \nU.S. 143\n, 35 S. Ct. 829. The Equitable Life Assurance Society of New York did business in Pennsylvania. The Legislature levied an annual tax of 2 per cent. upon the gross premiums of every character received from business done by it within the state during the preceding year. The company paid large taxes, but appealed to the state courts to relieve it from charges for such of the premiums for five years as had been paid outside the state by residents of Pennsylvania. It was contended by the company that such taxation was of property beyond the jurisdiction of the state, relying on the Allgeyer Case. This court held that the tax was a tax for the privilege of doing business in Pennsylvania, and that the fact that the state could not prevent the contracts did not interfere with its right to consider the benefit annually extended to the Assurance Society by Pennsylvania in measuring the value of the privileges so extended; that the tax was a tax upon a privilege actually used, and the only question concerned the mode of measuring the tax. This court said as to that:\n'A certain latitude must be allowed. It is obvious that many incidents of the contract are likely to be attended to in Pennsylvania, such as payment of dividends when received in cash, sending an adjuster into the state in case of dispute, or making proof of death. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Spratley, \n172 U.S. 602\n, 611 (19 S. Ct. 308); Pennsylvania Lumbermen's Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Meyer, \n197 U.S. 407\n, 415 (25 S. Ct. 483). It is not unnatural to take the policy holders residing in the state as a measure without going into nicer, if not impracticable details. Taxation has to be determined by general principles, and it seems to us \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n impossible to say that the rule adopted in Pennsylvania goes beyond what the Constitution allows.'\n\n The case is not in conflict either with the Allgeyer Case or with the Compress Case, decided as late as December, 1922. It turns entirely on the fact that the taxpayer had subjected itself to the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania in doing business there, and it was for the state to say what the condition of its doing that business in the matter of the payment of taxes should be. This court said that the Equitable Society was doing business in Pennsylvania when it was annually paying dividends in Pennsylvania or sending an adjuster into the state in case of dispute or making proof of death, and therefore that it was not improper to measure the tax for doing business in the state by the number of individuals whose lives had been insured and with respect to whom and the execution of whose contracts the company was necessarily doing business in the state, even if the premiums paid by some of them had not been paid in the state.\n It is true that in considering the question of the measure of the tax, this court referred to the argument of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the tax might be properly measured by New York contracts because Pennsylvania protected the individuals insured therein during their lives in Pennsylvania. Our court accepted this as one of several reasons for including such individuals in the measure of the tax because of the incidental business done by the insurance company in Pennsylvania which the living of such individuals in that state after the making of the contract brought into its performance and consummation. But such reference cannot be made a basis for an argument that such protection as the government of the Philippine Islands gave to the merchandise while being shipped at Manila furnished any jurisdiction for a tax by that government on the premiums paid in Barcelona upon the insurance contract. \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 98]\n\u00a0\n If that were to be admitted, then neither the Allgeyer nor the Compress Case could be sustained for the property in each of those cases was protected by the government seeking to impose the forbidden exactions upon the owner who obtained the insurance out of the state on that property within it. The tax here is not on the property insured. It is a tax on the contract or its proceeds which were not in the Philippines or expected to be there. The Equitable Society Case does not control or affect the question we are considering. Unless we are to reverse the Compress and Allgeyer Cases, the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippines in respect to the tax on the premiums paid to the Paris Company must be held to be erroneous.\n Second. We come now to the question of the tax upon the premiums paid to the London Company, which was licensed and presumably was doing business in the Philippine Islands. Does the fact that, while the Tobacco Company and the London Company were within the jurisdiction of the Philippines, they made a contract outside of the Philippines for the insurance of merchandise in the Philippines, prevent the imposition upon the assured of a tax of 1 per cent. upon the money paid by it as a premium to the London Company? We may properly assume that this tax placed upon the assured must ultimately be paid by the insurer, and treating its real incidence as such, the question arises whether making and carrying out the policy does not involve an exercise or use of the right of the London Company to do business in the Philippine Islands under its license, because the policy covers fire risks on property within the Philippine Islands which may require adjustment and the activities of agents in the Philippine Islands with respect to settlement of losses arising thereunder. This we think must be answered affirmatively under Equitable Life Soc. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n238 \nU.S. 143\n, 35 S. Ct. 829. The case is a close one, but, in deference to the conclusion we \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 99]\n\u00a0\n reached in the latter case, we affirm the judgment of the court below in respect to the tax upon the premium paid to the London Company. it bought goods and put them into its Phillippine Islands is reversed in part and affirmed in part.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n This is a suit to recover the amount of a tax alleged to have been illegally imposed. The plaintiff is a Spanish corporation licensed to do business in the Philippine Islands and having an office in Manila. In 1922 from time to time it bought goods and put them into its Philippine warehouses. It notified its head office in Barcelona, Spain, of the value of the goods and that office thereupon insured them under open policies issued by a company of London. From time to time also the Philippine branch shipped the goods abroad for sale and secured insurance upon the shipments in the same manner, the premiums being charged to it in both cases. By section 192 of the Philippine Insurance Act No. 2427, as amended by Act No. 2430, where owners of property obtain insurance directly with foreign companies the owners are required to report each case to the Collector of Internal Revenue and to 'pay the tax of one per centum on premium paid, in the manner required by law of insurance companies.' The defendant Collector collected this tax on the above mentioned premiums from the plaintiff against its protest. The plaintiff bases its suit upon the contentions that the statute is contrary to the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, c. 416,  3 (the Jones Act), 39 Stat. 545, 546, 547, as depriving it of its property without due process of law, and also as departing from the requirement in the same section that the rules of taxation shall be uniform. The Supreme Court of the Philippines upheld the tax. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n271 \nU.S. 655\n, 46 S. Ct. 486. \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 100]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff's reliance is upon Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n, 17 S. Ct. 427, in which it was held that a fine could not be imposed by the State for sending a notice similar to the present to an insurance company out of the State. But it seems to me that the tax was justified and that this case is distinguished from that of Allgeyer and from St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n, 43 S. Ct. 125, by the difference between a penalty and a tax. It is true, as indicated in the last cited case, that every exaction of money for an act is a discouragement to the extent of the payment required, but that which in its immediacy is a discouragement may be part of an encouragement when seen in its organic connection with the whole. Taxes are what we pay for civilized society, including the chance to insure. A penalty on the other hand is intended altogether to prevent the thing punished. It readily may be seen that a State may tax things that under the Constitution as interpreted it can not prevent. The constitutional right asserted in Allgeyer v. Louisiana to earn one's livelihood by any lawful calling certainly is consistent, as we all know, with the calling being taxed.\n Sometimes there may be a difficulty in deciding whether an imposition is a tax or a penalty, but generally the intent to prohibit when it exists is plainly expressed. Sometimes even when it is called a tax the requirement is shown to be a penalty by its excess in amount over the tax in similar cases, as in St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas. But in the present instance there is no room for doubt. The charge not only is called a tax but is the same in amount as that imposed where the right to impose it is not denied.\n The government has the insured within its jurisdiction. I can see no ground for denying its right to use its power to tax unless it can be shown that it has conferred no benefit of a kind that would justify the tax, as is held with regard to property outside of a State belonging to one within it. Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 489\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316. \n\n[275 U.S. 87, 101]\n\u00a0\n But here an act was done in the Islands that was intended by the plaintiff to be and was an essential step towards the insurance, and, if that is not enough, the government of the Islands was protecting the property at the very moment in respect of which it levied the tax. Precisely this question was met and disposed of in Equitable Life Assurance Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n238 \nU.S. 143, 147\n, 35 S. Ct. 829\n\n\n The result of upholding the government's action is just. When it taxes domestic insurance it reasonably may endeavor not to let the foreign insurance escape. If it does not discriminate against the latter it naturally does not want to discriminate against its own.\n The suggestion that the rule of taxation is not uniform may be disposed of in a few words. The uniformity required is uniformity in substance not in form. The insurance is taxed uniformly, and although in the case of domestic insurance the tax is laid upon the company whereas here it is laid upon the insured, it must be presumed that in the former case the company passes the tax on to the insured as an element in the premium charged.\n For these reasons Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and I are of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Islands should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORNELL STEAMBOAT CO. v.

It was stipulated in the contract that the government might terminate it in whole or in part at any time, and in that event certain enumerated payments were to be made, not including, however, prospective profits upon uncompleted articles. The contract provided that upon written notice the government \n\n[273 U.S. 324, 325]\n\u00a0\n might make changes in the specifications, increased cost, if any, to be paid, and, for any delay in consequence thereof, a corresponding extension of time for the performance of the contract to be allowed. After the Armistice appellant was requested to suspend work, with a view to the negotiation of a supplemental contract providing for the cancellation, settlement, and adjustment of the existing contract. Subsequently appellant filed a claim; and a partial payment supplemental contract was executed, by which the government agreed to make appellant an advance payment and speedily determine and pay certain specified items. Appellant agreed that it would not perform further work or services, or incur further expense in connection with the performance of the uncompleted part of its original contract, and expressly waived 'all claim to the prospective profits which he (it) might have made from the performance of that portion of said original contract which under the terms of this supplemental agreement will not be performed.' The advance payment was made, and the court below found that, after its deduction and the allowance of another credit, there was due appellant a balance of $14,192. 25; and it refused to allow appellant anything for profits which appellant would have realized if the contract had been performed. Judgment was rendered accordingly. 60 Ct. Cl. 201.

Darby, of New York City, for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition of the appellant on the 4th of May, 1925, 60 Ct. Cl. 1034. This was before the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229 ( 43 Stat. 936), by which direct appeals under sections 242 and 243 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219, 1220) from the Court of Claims were repealed, and the review by certiorari was substituted.\n The De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company filed its petition in the Court of Claims against the United States, seeking to recover for an alleged unlawful use by the government of certain patented vacuum tubes or audions used in radio communication. The suit was brought under the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 423 (36 Stat. 851), as amended by the Act of July 1, 1918, c. 114 (40 Stat. 704, 705), that, whenever an invention described that, whenever an invetion described in and covered by a patent of the United States should thereafter be used by the government without license of the owner or lawful right to use it, the owner could recover reasonable compensation for the use in the Court of Claims, provided that the United States could avail itself of all defenses, general or special, which might be pleaded by any other defendant charged with infringement. The amending act of 1918 enlarged the scope of the act by providing that the recovery by the \n\n[273 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n owner should include compensation for patented inventions used or made by or for the United States.\n The petition showed that the two patents involved in the suit were granted to De Forest, and by him were duly assigned to the appellant, the company bearing him name; that that company executed and delivered to the Western Electric Company a written instrument conveying certain rights in the patents, which were subsequently conveyed to the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. This contract was set out in the petition. In consideration of $1 and other good and valuable considerations it granted a license to make, use, install, operate, and lease, and to sell or otherwise dispose of to others for sale, installation, and operation, apparatus and systems embodying or made or operating in accordance with the invention. It purported to give this license for the full terms of the patents and for all transferable rights of the De Forest Company in the inventions, except such as were expressly reserved by that company. The reservations included nonassignable rights for the purpose of making the articles in question for, and selling them to, the United States government for its use. The instrument further provided that the Western Company and the De Forest Company might respectively institute and conduct suits against others for any of the patents within the fields in which each respectively possessed rights, but that all such suits should be conducted at the expense of the party bringing them, that party to retain any judgment recovered in any such suits.\n Paragraph 12 of the instrument provided that the Western Company might transfer to others, in whole or in part, the rights granted by the instrument, and might assign rights thereunder or grant licenses to various persons, firms, or corporations for the several uses to which the inventions were applicable. The petition further \n\n[273 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n alleges that the United states, being engaged in war, informed the American Telephone & Telegraph Company that it desired to have large numbers of the audions made promptly for it by the General Electric Company and others; that the American Telephone & Telegraph Company replied by writing to the Chief Signal Officer of the Army that it would not do anything to interfere with the immediate manufacture of the audions, provided it were understood and agreed that the Telephone & Telegraph Company 'waived none of its claims under any patents or patent rights owned by it on account of said manufacture, and that all claims under patent rights and all patent questions be reserved and later investigated, adjusted, and settled by the United States.' The plan was accepted by the United States, and the orders for said audions were thereafter given by the United States to said General Electric Company and said Moorhead Laboratories. Inc., who made them and delivered them to the government, which used them.\n The petition further alleged that, for the purpose of assisting the United States to obtain said audions promptly pursuant to the orders given, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company furnished information, drawings, and blueprints to the General Electric Company, and permitted representatives and experts of the United States and of said General Electric Company to witness and study the manufacture of said audions by the Telephone & Telegraph Company, all to the end that the audions might be the more promptly made and delivered to the United States for use in the war in which it was then engaged.\n After the filing of the petition in the suit, it was amended by an averment that, after the audions were made and used by the United States, negotiations were carried on between it and the American Telephone Company, and that the latter company executed a release to \n\n[273 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n the United States and all manufacturers acting under its orders of all claims for compensation for the making and use of the audions, and that the release included 'all claims which had arisen or might thereafter arise for royalties, damages, profits, or compensation for infringement of any or all letters patent owned or controlled by the Telephone & Telegraph Company, whether expressly recited therein or not, for the manufacture or use prior thereto, and for use by the United States occurring thereafter.'\n The petition was demurred to, the demurrer was sustained, and the petition dismissed. It is conceded by the parties that on the face of the petition, with the contracts which were made exhibits, the De Forest Company and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company had each the right to license to the United States the making and use of these audions, and that, if either did so license them, it would be a complete defense to a claim for damages for the tort of infringement by the other.\n The sole question, therefore, which the Court of Claims considered and decided against the appellant was whether, on the facts recited in the petition, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company had in fact given a license to the United States to have made and use these audions covered by the patents. In other words, was the claim which the American Telephone & Telegraph Company had against the United States, for the manufacture and use of the audions, based on a contract, or was it based on a tort? If it were the former, it was a full defense to any claim by the De Forest Company. If it were the latter, the De Forest Company was entitled to recover under the act of 1918\n\n\n The appellant says that the necessary effect of the allegations of his petition is that the Telephone Company said to the United States, in answer to the United States' notice that it wished to make and use the audions, 'You \n\n[273 U.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n will be infringing my rights; I shall not stop you, but I notify you that I shall hold you for such infringement;' and therefore that the subsequent acts of the United States and its manufacturers were torts. We think a different construction should be given the allegations. The agreement by the Telephone Company that it would not do anything to interfere with the immediate making of the audions for the United States, interpreted in the light of its subsequent action in assisting the United States to a prompt making of the audions for its use, in furnishing the needed information and drawings and blueprints for such manufacture, and in giving to the experts of the United States and its manufacturers the opportunity to witness and study the manufacture of audions by the Telephone Company, to the end that the audions might be more promptly manufactured and delivered to the United States for use in the war, made such conduct clearly a consent to their manufacture and use, and a license, and this without any regard to the effect of the subsequent release by the Telephone & Telegraph Company of compensation for such manufacture and use.\n No formal granting of a license is necessary in order to give it effect. Any language used by the owner of the patent or any conduct on his part exhibited to another, from which that other may properly infer that the owner consents to his use of the patent in making or using it, or selling it, upon which the other acts, constitutes a license, and a defense to an action for a tort. Whether this constitutes a gratuitous license, or one for a reasonable compensation, must, of course, depend upon the circumstances; but the relation between the parties thereafter in respect of any suit brought must be held to be contractual, and not an unlawful invasion of the rights of the owner. Concede that, if the owner had said, 'If you go on and infringe my patent, I shall not attempt to enjoin you, but I shall subsequently sue you for infringement,' the tort would not be waived; \n\n[273 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n that is not this case. Here the circumstances show clearly that what the company was doing was not only fully consenting to the making and using by the United States of the patent, but was aiding such making and using, and in doing so was licensing it, only postponing to subsequent settlement what reasonable compensation, if any, it might claim for its license. The case of Henry v. Dick Co., 224 ,U. S. 1, 32 S. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 880, in its main point, was overruled in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959, but that does not shake the authority of the language of the court in the following passage (page 24 (32 S. Ct. 370)):\n'If a licensee be sued, he can escape liability to the patentee for the use of his invention by showing that the use is within his license; but, if his use be one prohibited by the license, the latter is of no avail as a defense. As a license passes no interest in the monopoly, it has been described as a mere waiver of the right to sue by the patentee'-citing Robinson on Patents,  806 and 808.\n\n In this case the language used certainly indicated the purpose of the Telephone Company not to seek an injunction against infringement, and not to sue for damages therefor, but only to sue or seek for an amicable settlement by payment of just compensation. Such action by the Telephone Company was a license, and constituted a complete defense against a suit for infringement by the De Forest Company.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDE LA METTRIE v.

Both causes had been heard upon a single record.\n In No. 54 appellants, citizens of France, sought to recover from the Alien Property Custodian certain funds seized by him November 5, 1918, as the property of an alien enemy. They relied upon section 9, Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended by Act June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 e). The court below held that the claim did not arise with reference to money or property held by the Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States and affirmed the decree of the trial court which dismissed the bill. Banco Mexicano v. Deutsche Bank, \n263 \nU.S. 591\n, 44 S. Ct. 209. Considering the facts disclosed and the definite terms of the statute, this action was clearly right.

Thereafter he asked to be made party to cause No. 54, claiming that by reason of such appointment he had an interest in the fund held by the Custodian. The trial court denied this application and upon appeal the court below affirmed that action. The claim is without merit.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 344\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Louis S. Beedy, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Mr. Assistant Attorney General Letts, and Messrs. J. Kennedy White, of Buffalo, N. Y., and Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon his appointment as postmaster at Fairbanks, Alaska, petitioner Deal executed the ordinary official bond, with the Fidelity & Guaranty Company as surety, conditioned that he 'shall faithfully discharge all duties \n\n[274 U.S. 277, 278]\n\u00a0\n and trusts imposed on him as postmaster either by law or by the regulations of the Post Office Department,' etc. The United States sued on this bond in a District Court of Alaska and asked judgment for $9,900, the amount of currency abstracted from a package deposited in the Fairbanks office for registration and transmission. Judgment upon a verdict went for them and was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding errors by the trial court, recognized, but held to be harmless. 11 F.(2d) 3.\n Replying to the petition for certiorari from this court, the Solicitor General very properly said:\n'The record is in a jumble, and the treatment of the case by the trial court involved so many inconsistencies that the case is difficult to analyze.'\n\n The trial judge charged the jury upon three inconsistent theories: (1) That the postmaster was liable for the abstracted money only if guilty of some negligence which caused the loss; (2) that liability existed if he had violated some regulation of the Post Office Department respecting care of the registered package, although not shown to be proximate cause of the loss; (3) that the money taken, being property of the United States, was public funds, and the postmaster became liable therefor as an insurer as though it had been received from sale of stamps or money orders.\n Among other things, the record discloses-\n That on September 15, 1921, the First National Bank deposited at the Fairbanks post office for registration and transmission a package addressed to the disbursing agent at Healy, Alaska, via Nenana, which contained $9,900 in currency and some silver belonging to the United States. The clerk who received and registered it thought the package contained money, but was not so advised. Another clerk placed it in an iron safe and left the door on the day combination. \n\n[274 U.S. 277, 279]\n\u00a0\n That during the night of September 15 petitioner Deal permitted an unauthorized person to enter the office. September 16 the package was placed in the pouch destined to Nenana. Upon its arrival at that place the currency was gone-a magazine filled the space.\n That some evidence touching treatment of the package at the Fairbanks office and much testimony concerning transportation, tended to show the bills were abstracted while it remained there.\n Considering the serious nature of the errors committed by the trial court and upon the entire record, we must conclude that they caused material prejudice to the petitioners' substantial rights. Act Feb. 26, 1919, c. 48 (40 Stat. 1181 (Comp. St.  1246)). Accordingly, the challenged judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for another trial. Under this conclusion, we need only consider matters probably important for further conduct of the cause.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals properly rejected, and the Solicitor General does not rely upon, the theory that under section 3846, R. S., being Comp. St.  7208 (section 360, Postal Regulations 1913), the postmaster became liable for the registered package as an insurer. That section provides:\n'Postmasters shall keep safely, without loaning, using, depositing in an unauthorized bank, or exchanging for other funds, all the public money collected by them, or which may come into their possession, until it is ordered by the Postmaster General to be transferred or paid out.'\n\n Public money, within this provision, 'obviously is money belonging to the United States in such sense that it may be ordered by the Postmaster General to be transferred or paid out.' Smyer v. United States (Feb. 21, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 333\n, 47 S. Ct. 375.\n It is admitted that petitioner Deal failed to observe certain regulations intended to secure safety of registered matter; but it is stoutly denied that the evidence showed any causal connection between such negligence or disregard of duty and the loss sustained. \n\n[274 U.S. 277, 280]\n\u00a0\n During 1921, the 1913 Edition, Postal Laws and Regulations, was in force. Sections which require special consideration follow:\n'Sec. 291. When a post office has been robbed, the postmaster shall immediately report all the facts to the chief inspector and to the post office inspector in charge of the division in which the post office is located. (See section 35.) The report should give, if possible, all the circumstances connected with the robbery, the date, a detailed inventory of the loss, the denominations of stamped paper stolen, the amount of postal and money-order funds and of each class of government property. The postmaster shall be held responsible for the loss if he fails to exercise due care in the protection of the property. If the loss includes the mail key the number should be given. (See section 1527.) Full particulars regarding registered mail lost or rifled should be reported. The chief inspector shall promptly notify the Assistant Attorney General of every such casualty from which a claim for credit under the provisions of section 150 may arise. ...\n\n'Sec. 940. Postmasters and other postal employees will be held personally responsible by the Post Office Department for the wrong delivery, depredation upon, or loss of any registered letter or parcel if such wrong delivery, depredation, or loss be due to negligence or disregard of the regulations. (The provisions of this section appear unchanged as section 989, Edition 1924 of the Regulations.)\n\n'Sec. 150. (Act May 9, 1888, c. 231, 25 Stat. 135, as amended by Act June 11, 1896, c. 424, 29 Stat. 458.) That the Postmaster General be, and he is hereby, authorized to investigate all claims of postmasters for the loss of money-order funds, postal funds, postage stamps, stamped envelopes, newspaper wrappers, and postal cards, belonging to the United States in the hands of such postmasters, resulting from burglary, fire, or other un- \n\n[274 U.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n avoidable casualty, and if he shall determine that such loss resulted from no fault or negligence on the part of such postmasters, to pay to such postmasters, or credit them with the amount so ascertained to have been lost or destroyed,' etc.\n\n Did section 291 impose liability for theft from the registered package while held by the postmaster and not protected as the Regulations required, without evidence to show that the loss resulted from failure to observe them? If so, it was unnecessary to show such causal connection, as the United States maintain. But, if section 940 defined the responsibility, as he insists, that relation was essential.\n Section 492, Edition 1879, Postal Laws and Regulations; section 700, Ed. 1887; section 669, Ed. 1893; section 278, Ed. 1902; section 328, Ed. 1924-correspond to section 291, Ed. 1913\n\n\n Edition 1879:\n'Sec. 492. Postmasters to Immediately Report port Robbery of Post Office. Whenever a post office has been robbed the postmaster will immediately report all the facts. ... This report must state as fully as possible all the circumstances connected with the robbery, giving the date and extent of the loss. He must be careful to state whether the loss consists of stamps, stamped envelopes, postal cards, letters (stolen or rifled), postal or money-order funds, or government property. ... He must give all the information in his possession relating to each lost or rifled registered letter. ...

When a post office has been broken into by burglars, the postmaster shall (make report, etc.) ... Full particulars also regarding registered mail lost or rifled should be given. ... The postmaster shall be held responsible for the loss if he fails to exercise due care in the protection of the property.'\n\n Section 864, Edition 1902 (to which section 940, Edition 1913, corresponds), provides:\n'Postmasters will be held personally responsible by the Post Office Department for the wrong delivery, depredation upon, or loss of any registered letter or parcel while in their custody, if such wrong delivery, depredation, or loss be due to negligence or disregard of the regulations. They are also liable on their bond for any damage resulting to the department on account of such wrong delivery, depredation, or loss.'\n\n For many years the Regulations imposed possible or positive liability upon postmasters for loss of registered mail when the office had been robbed and lack of care appeared; also the general provisions of section 940. And the argument is that we cannot deduce from the altered language of section 291, Edition 1913, intention to relieve from the strict liability theretofore imposed. But why the change if it meant nothing? And may petitioners be subjected to liability because of language found in ancient regulations of which, probably, they had no knowledge? \n\n[274 U.S. 277, 283]\n\u00a0\n On the other hand is the suggestion that to hold postmasters responsible under section 291 for the loss of currency from registered packages would produce an anomalous situation, since this would leave the Postmaster General with full power, under section 150, to relieve where money order funds are lost but with no such power where money belonging to the United States is taken from a registered package the contents of which had not been revealed.\n Difficulties, of course, arise from the words 'robbery' in section 291 and 'depredation upon' in section 940. Robbery, accurately defined, is 'the felonious and forcible taking from the person of another, goods or money to any value, by violence or putting him in fear.' Bouvier's Law Dictionary; Jolly v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 402, 404\n, 18 S. Ct. 624. Depredation is 'the act of plundering; a robbing; a pillaging.' Century Dictionary. Apparently the Regulations contained no definition of these terms. Generally, at least, the word 'robbery' conveys the idea of violence and it is hardly appropriate to stealthy abstraction. One may well doubt the application of section 291 in the circumstances here disclosed. The author of section 328, of the Regulations, Edition 1924, probably noted that larceny, burglary and robbery are distinct offenses.\n The structure and language of section 291 are not wholly inconsistent with the theory that postmasters 'shall be held responsible for the loss' of property described by the lines immediately preceding the quoted words; but for 'registered mail lost or rifled' 'when a post office has been robbed' they become responsible only if the 'depredation or loss be due to negligence or disregard of the Regulations.'\n Certainly the Regulations of 1913 are far from clear. Considering the language and the arrangement of section 291 along with the general provisions of section 940, and not forgetting that both were prepared by the Post Office Department, are subject to alteration, impose large respon- \n\n[274 U.S. 277, 284]\n\u00a0\n sibility, and should be construed according to the probable understanding of men who accept such offices, we conclude that section 940 prescribed the petitioners' responsibility, and the jury should have been charged accordingly. It was necessary to show causal connection between the loss and the alleged negligence or disregard of regulations.\n We accept the ruling by the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the disputed items of cost taxed against petitioners by the trial court, except as to charges by witnesses for travel outside the district. That item should be eliminated.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDI SANTO v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA(1927)\nNo. 288\nArgued: October 27, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. H. Neely, of Harrisburg, Pa., and J. H. Neely, of Mifflintown, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. E. Le. Roy Keen, of Lykens, Pa., and Philip S. Moyer, of Harrisburg, Pa., for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was indicted in the court of quarter sessions of Deuphin county, Pennsylvania, for a violation of an Act of the Legislature of July 17, 1919 (P. L. 1003) as amended by the Act of May 20, 1921 (P. L. 997; Pa. St. Supp. 1924,  20197), requiring licenses to sell steamship tickets or orders for transportation to or from foreign countries. The indictment alleged that, December 14, 1921, without having obtained a license so to do, plaintiff in error held himself out as authorized to sell tickets and orders for transportation as agent of certain steampship companies, and that he engaged in the sale of such tickets. There was no controversy as to the facts, and, by direction of the court, the jury returned to verdict of guilty. Plaintiff in error, by motion in arrest of judgment, challenged the validity of the act on the ground that it contravenes the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. The court held the statute, valid, and sentenced him to pay a fine. On appeal the Superior Court held the act unconstitutional and reversed the judgment. The Supreme Court reversed the Superior Court and reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The case is here under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n The act of 1921 provides that no person or corporation, other than a railroad or steamship company, shall engage within the state in the sale of steamship tickets or orders for transportation or shall hold himself out as authorized to sell such tickets or orders without having first procured a license. It requires every applicant to cause his application to be advertised in specified publications, to furnish proof that he is of good moral character and fit to conduct the business, to give a list of the steamship lines, not less than three, for which he is agent, and to file a bond in the penal sum of $1,000 conditioned that he will account to all interested persons for moneys received for tickets and orders and that he will not be guilty \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n of any fraud or misrepresentation to purchasers. The license is granted on approval of the commissioner of banking and payment of a fee of $50, and may be renewed on payment of a like fee annually. The license may be revoked for fraud, misrepresentation or failure to account. Any person carrying on this business without license is declared guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to fine or imprisonment or both. The state Supreme Court declared that the act is one to prevent fraud, and held that it does not require an agent or servant of the steamship companies to have a license, but that plaintiff is not such an agent, and that he occupies a position in the nature of an independent contractor, and is required to obtain a license.\n Plaintiff represented four steamship companies operating steamships between the United States and Europe. Each of them gave him a certificate authorizing him to sell, at a specified place in Harrisburg, tickets and orders for transportation entitling persons therein named to passage on such steamships, and required the certificate to be posted in his office. This is in accordance with the Pennsylvania act of 1863 (P. L. 582; Pa. St. 1920,  18643-18648) regulating the display of certificates by steamship agents, and a copy of that act was printed on the certificate. The companies furnished plaintiff in error books of tickets having stubs on which to make record of tickets sold, advertising matter to be used by him, schedules of sailings, notices of cancellations of sailings, and information as to the immigration and customs services, and they authorized him to collect money for tickets sold. He usually received 25 per cent. of the price when applications were made for the tickets. He gave each company a bond to account, and transmitted immediately to his respective principals the amounts received by him.\n The soliciting of passengers and the sale of steamship tickets and orders for passage between the United States \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n and Europe constitute a well-recognized part of foreign commerce. See Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312, 315\n, 43 S. Ct. 556. A state statute which by its necessary operation directly interferes with or burdens foreign commerce is a prohibited regulation and invalid, regardless of the purpose with which it was passed. Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 199\n, 45 S. Ct. 481, and cases cited. Such legislation cannot be sustained as an exertion of the police power of the state to prevent possible fraud. Real Silk Mills v. Portland, \n268 \nU.S. 325, 336\n, 45 S. Ct. 525. The Congress has complete and paramount authority to regulate foreign commerce and, by appropriate measures, to protect the public against the frauds of those who sell these tickets and orders. The sales here in question are related to foreign commerce as directly as are sales made in ticket offices maintained by the carriers and operated by their servants and employees. The license free and other things imposed by the act on plaintiff in error, who initiates for his principals a transaction in foreign commerce, constitute a direct burden on that commerce. This case is controlled by Texas Transport Co. v. New Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S. Ct. 242, 34 A. R. L. 907, and McCall v. California, \n136 \nU.S. 104\n, 10 S. Ct. 881.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs, dissenting.\n The statute is an exertion of the police power of the state. Its evident purpose is to prevent a particular species of fraud and imposition found to have been practiced in Pennsylvania upon persons of small means, unfamiliar with our language and institutions. \n1\n Much of the \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n immigration into the United States is effected by arrangements made here for remittance of the means of travel. The individual immigrant is often an advance . After gaining a foothold here, he has his wife and children, aged parents, brothers, sisters or other relatives follow. To this end he remits steamship tickets or orders for transportation. The purchase of the tickets involves trust in the dealer. This is so not only because of the nature of the transaction, but also because a purchaser when unable to pay the whole price at one time makes successive deposits on account, the ticket or order not being delivered until full payment is made. The facilities for remitting both cash and steamship tickets are commonly furnished by private bankers of the same nationality as the immigrant. It was natural that the supervision of persons engaged in the business of supplying steamship tickets should be committed by the statute to the commissioner of banking. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Although the purchase made is of an ocean steamship ticket, the transaction regulated is wholly intrasate-as much so as if the purchase were of local real estate or of local theater tickets. There is no purpose on the part of \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n the state to regulate foreign commerce. The statute is not an obstruction to foreign commerce. It does not discriminate against foreign commerce. It places no direct burden upon such commerce. It does not affect the commerce except indirectly. Congress could, of course, deal with the subject, because it is connected with foreign commrce. But it has not done so. Nor has it legislated on any allied subject. Thus, there can be no contention that Congress has occupied the field. And obviously, also, this is not a case in which the silence of Congress can be interpreted as a prohibition of state action-as a declaration that in the sale of ocean steamship tickets fraud may be practiced without let or hindrance. If Pennsylvania must submit to seeing its citizens defrauded, it is not because Congress has so willed, but because the Constitution so commands. I cannot believe that it does.\n Unlike the ordinance considered in Texas Transport Co. v. New Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S. Ct. 242, 34 A. L. R. 907, this statute is not a revenue measure. The license fee is small. The whole of the proceeds is required to defray the expense of supervising the business. Unlike the measure considered in Real Silk Mills v. Portland, \n268 \nU.S. 325, 336\n, 45 S. Ct. 525, this statute is not an instrument of discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce. Unlike that considered in Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 199\n, 45 S. Ct. 481, it does not affect the price of articles moving in interstate commerce. The licensing and supervision of dealers in steamship tickets is in essence an inspection law. Compare Turner v. Mary land. \n107 \nU.S. 38\n, 2 S. Ct. 44.\n The fact that the sale of the ticket is made as a part of a transaction in foreign or interstate commerce does not preclude application of state inspection laws, where, as here, Congress has not entered the flend, and the state regulation neither obstructs, discriminates against, nor directly burden the commerce.

To require that the dealer in tickets be licensed in order to guard against fraud in the local sale of tickets certainly affects interstate or foreign commerce less directly than to provide a test of the locomotive engineer's skill, Smith v.

Ct. 169-state requirements sustained by this court. See, also Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 \nU.S. 128, 138\n, 31 S. Ct. 190. \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 41]\n\u00a0\n It is said that McCall v. California, \n136 \nU.S. 104\n, 10 S. Ct. 881, requires that the Pennsylvania statute be held void. McCall was an employee of the railroad, not an independent solicitor or dealer. Di Santo, as the state court found the facts, was not an employee of a steamship company, nor an agent authorized to act for one, and it ruled, as a matter of statutory construction, that, if he had been such, he would not have been required by the statute to be licensed. It found him to be an independent dealer or contractor, 'a free lance' authorized by the several steamship companies 'to sell tickets or orders entitling the persons therein named to passage upon steamers,' but 'with no obligation to any particular company,' except the remit the net amount payable by him to the company for a ticket or order sold. Moreover, the fee imposed by the San Francisco ordinance was an occupation tax, not an inspection fee. Here the Pennsylvania court found that the statute did not produce any revenue.\n On the facts, the McCall Case is distinguishable from that at bar. If, because of its reasoning, it is thought not to be distinguishable, it should be disregarded. The doctrine of state decisis presents no obstacle. Disregard of the McCall Case would not involve unsettlement of any constitutional principle or of any rule of law, properly so called. It would involve merely refusal to repeat an error once made in applying a rule of law-an error which has already proved misleading as a precedent. While the question whether a particular statute has the effect of burdening interstate or foreign commerce directly presents always a question of law, the determination upon which the validity or invalidity of the statute depends is largely or wholly one of fact. The rule of law which governs the McCall Case and the one at bar is the same. It is that a State may not obstruct, discriminate against or directly burden interstate or foreign commerce. The question at bar is whether as applied to existing facts \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 42]\n\u00a0\n this particular statute is a direct burden. The decision as to state regulations of this character, depends often, as was said in Southern Railway v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524, 533\n, 30 S. Ct. 594, 596 (54 L. Ed. 868), 'upon their effect upon interstate commerce.' In that case, the Georgia blow post law was held constitutional, as not being a direct burden. In Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Blackwell, \n244 \nU.S. 310\n, 37 S. Ct. 640, L. R. A. 1917F, 1184, the same statute was held, on other facts, to be void, because shown to be a direct burden. Each case required the decision of the question of law. Each involved merely an appreciation of the facts. Neither involved the declaration of a rule of law.\n It is usually more important that a rule of law be settled, than that it be settled right. Even where the error in declaring the rule is a matter of serious concern, it is ordinarily better to seek correction by legislation. Often this is true although the question is a constitutional one. The human experience embodied in the doctrine of stare decisis teaches us, also, that often it is better to follow a precedent, although it does not involve the declaration of a rule. This is usually true so far as concerns a particular statute whether the error was made in construing it or in passing upon its validity. But the doctrine of stare decisis does not command that we err again when we have occasion to pass upon a different statute. In the search for truth through the slow process of inclusion and exclusion, involving trial and error, it behooves us to reject, as guides, the decisions upon such questions which prove to have been mistaken. This course seems to me imperative when, as here, the decision to be made involves the delicate adjustment of conflicting claims of the federal government and the states to regulate commerce. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[273 U.S. 34, 43]\n\u00a0\n The many cases on the commerce clause in which this court has overruled or explained away its earlier decisions show that the wisdom of this course has been heretofore recognized. \n4\n In the case at bar, also, the logic of words should yield to the logic of realities.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I agree with all that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS has said, but I would add a word with respect to one phase of the matter which seems to me of some importance. We are not here concerned with a question of taxation to which other considerations may apply, but with state regulation of what may be conceded to be an instrumentality of foreign commerce. As this court has many times decided, the purpose of the commerce clause was not to preclude all state regulation of commerce crossing state \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 44]\n\u00a0\n lines but to prevent discrimination and the erection of barriers or obstacles to the free flow of commerce, interstate or foreign.\n The recognition of the power of the states to regulate commerce within certain limits is a recognition that there are matters of local concern which may properly be subject to state regulation and which, because of their local character, as well as their number and diversity, can never be adequately dealt with by Congress. Such regulation, so long as it does not impede the free flow of commerce, may properly be and for the most part has been left to the state by the decisions of this court.\n In this case the traditional test of the limit of state action by inquiring whether the interference with commerce is direct or indirect seems to me too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value. In thus making use of the expressions, 'direct' and 'indirect interference' with commerce, we are doing little more than using labels to describe a result rather than any trustworthy formula by which it is reached.\n It is difficult to say that such permitted interferences as those enumerated in Mr. Justcie BRANDEIS' opinion are less direct than the interference prohibited here. But it seems clear that those interferences not deemed forbidden are to be sustained, not because the effect on commerce is nominally indirect, but because a consideration of all the facts and circumstances, such as the nature of the regulation, its function, the character of the business involved and the actual effect on the flow of commerce, lead to the conclusion that the regulation concerns interests peculiarly local and does not infringe the national interest in maintaining the freedom of commerce across state lines.\n I am not persuaded that the regulation here is more than local in character or that it interposes any barrier \n\n[273 U.S. 34, 45]\n\u00a0\n to commerce. Until Congress undertakes the protection of local communities from the dishonesty of the sellers of steamship tickets, it would seem that there is no adequate ground for holding that the regulation here involved is a prohibited interference with commerce.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A similar statute had been enacted in New York, with the approval of Gov. (afterwards Mr. Justice) Charles E. Hughes. Laws of New York 1910, c. 349, amended by Laws of New York 1911, c. 578. And similar laws have been enacted also in other states. Indiana, Burns' Ann.

Alfred J. Talley and Charles H. Tuttle, both of New York City, for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States filed a bill in equity in the District Court for Southern New York, under section 22 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 k), to abate a liquor nuisance alleged to be maintained by Duignan, the appellant, upon premises occupied by him under a lease. By amended bill, the appellee the Pall Mall Realty Corporation, the owner of the leased premises, was made a party defendant. In its answer, it admitted the allegations of the bill. By cross-bill it set up its ownership of the premises, its lease to Duignan, the maintenance of a liquor nuisance by him on the premises in violation of section 21 of title 2 of the National Pro- \n\n[274 U.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n hibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 jj) and asked that the lease be forfeited under section 23 of title 2 of the act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 l). Appellant neither answered the cross-bill nor directed any motion to it, but made application for a jury trial which was denied.\n On the trial without a jury, appellant drew in question the constitutionality of the forfeiture of his leasehold as a denial of due process of law. After the trial, in which the existence of the nuisance was litigated, the District Court decreed the forfeiture of the lease. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 4 f. (2d) 983. The case is properly here on appeal, Jud. Code,  241, before amended (Comp. St.  1218), and the petition for certiorari, filed as a jurisdictional precaution, is denied.\n At the outset, appellant denies the jurisdiction of the District Court to try the issues raised by the cross-bill, in the absence of diversity of citizenship. Section 23 provides:\n'Any violation of this title upon any leased premises by the lessee or occupant thereof shall, at the option of the lessor, work a forfeiture of the lease.'\n\n The right thus given to the lessor to forfeit the lease is one arising under a law of the United States and the District Court had jurisdiction to determine a suit founded upon it, regardless of the citizenship of the parties. Judicial Code,  24(a), being Comp. St.  991.\n Numerous other questions are raised by appellant's brief and argument, but so far as they are of substance they are involved in or incidental to the two principal grounds urged for reversal: (1) That appellant was denied the right to a jury trial, in violation of the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution; and (2) that the forfeiture of appellant's lease is a denial of due process of law.\n So far as appellant's motion for a jury trial was directed to the issues raised by the bill and answer, it was properly denied, as section 22 of the National Prohibition Act \n\n[274 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n authorizes the obatement of a liquor nuisance by a bill in equity filed by the United States. Cf. Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630\n, 47 S. Ct. 218. But it is urged, assuming the constitutionality of section 23, that section at most gives a right at law to a possessory action for the recovery of the leased premises, which is not cognizable in a court of equity, and in any case appellant was entitled to have the issues raised by the cross-bill tried by a jury.\n Appellant's application for a jury was in terms a motion for an order 'framing for trial by jury the issues in this action as to the occurrences of the alleged violations of the National Prohibition Act.' It clearly appears from the notice of motion and the supporting affidavits that the motion was not a challenge to the equity jurisdiction of the court nor a demand for a jury trial in an action at law, such as is guaranteed by the Constitution. It was rather an application addressed to the discretion of the court sitting in equity to frame issues for a jury to aid, as stated, 'in advising the court as to the credibility of the witnesses,' and was made on the ground that this was 'not the usual equity case, which ordinarily involves only matters of law.'\n The right to a jury trial may be waived where there is an appearance and participation in the trial without demanding a jury. Kearney v. Case, 12 Wall. 275; Perego v. Dodge, \n163 \nU.S. 160, 166\n, 16 S. Ct. 971. Section 649 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1587) provides that issues of fact may be tried by the court without a jury, upon written stipulation of the parties, and that the finding of the court upon the facts shall have the same effect as the verdict of the jury. But this section does not preclude other kinds of waiver. Kearney v. Case, supra. Its purpose and effect, when read together with sections 648 and 700 (Comp. St.  1584, 1668), is to define the scope of appellate review in actions at law without a jury. Unless there is a written stipulation waiving a jury, there can be no review of the rulings on questions of law in \n\n[274 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n the course of the trial or of the sufficiency of a special finding to support the judgment. See Law v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 494, 496\n, 45 S. Ct. 175. Cf. Fleischmann Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 356 S., 46 S. Ct. 284. Appellant's failure to demand a trial by a common-law jury amounted, we think, to a waiver of the constitutional right, if any, now claimed.\n But, even if his application for a jury trial be regarded as an assertion of his constitutional right, there were no issues to be tried by a jury, as he had failed to answer the cross-bill. The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 110. Hence, there was no error in the court's finding the facts supporting its judgment, without a jury. Whether issues raised by the pleadings in proceedings under section 23 must be tried by jury if seasonably demanded is a question which does not arise on this record.\n Appellant on appeal for the first time challenged the equity jurisdiction of the court, urging that the remedy at law was adequate. The cancellation of appellant's lease, which was the relief sought, was a remedy competent for equity to give. The repeated holdings of the lower courts that a suit brought under section 23 is one cognizable in equity,1 at least suggest that the suit is not so plainly at law that the court should, of its own motion, have dismissed it. Under such circumstances, objection to the equity jurisdiction not seasonably taken is waived ( Kilbourn v. Sunderland, \n130 \nU.S. 505, 514\n, 9 S. Ct. 594; Brown v. Lake Superior Iron Co., \n134 U.S. 530\n, 534-536, 10 S. Ct. 604; Perego v. Dodge, supra, 164 (16 S. Ct. 971)), especially where, as here, appellant did not answer the cross-bill. For the same reason it is unnecessary for us to determine whether appellee adopted the proper procedure in seeking the forfeiture of the lease by cross-bill.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n We do not consider the constitutionality of the forfeiture under section 23. The court below in enumerating the questions raised and presented made no mention of the constitutional question.

St.  1251 1\/4-1251 1\/4 l), and against the seaboard Transportation Company, as joint defendants. It averred that the libelant, a corporation of the state of Maryland, was the owner of the barge Winstead and the bailee of the cargo of the barge; that the Seaboard Transportation Company owned the tug Covington and the barge Pottsville; that on August 15, 1920, the steamship Snug Harbor, owned and used by the United States solely as a merchant vessel, while on a voyage from Baltimore, Md., to Portland, Me., came into collision with a barge Pottsville in tow of the tug Covington, was sunk, and became a total loss; that the wreck of the Snug Harbor lodged about 4 1\/4 miles from Montauk Point, in a frequented channel way within the harbors and inland waters of the United States; that it was not marked with a buoy or beacon by day or a lighted lantern by night, and was not removed by the United States or the Seaboard Transportation Company, and that no notice had been given or published advising mariners navigating the neighboring waters of the presence of the wreck; that the barge Winstead, loaded with a full cargo of coal, on the 14th day of September, 1920, came into conact with the wreck and as a result was sunk, and it and its cargo became a total loss, to the damage of the libelant in the sum of $105,000; that the collision between the Snug Harbor and the Pottsville was due to the negligence of both; that the collision of the Winstead with the wreck was without negligence of those engaged in her navigation, but was due to the unlawful presence of the wreck, for which the respondents were jointly and severally responsible.\n The United States district attorney appeared specially for the government, for the purpose of suggesting to the court that it was without jurisdiction so far as the United States was concerned; that the cause of action stated \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 683]\n\u00a0\n related to a failure on the part of the officers and agents of the United States to perform a purely governmental function, or to the alleged negligence of such officers and agents in the performance of such a function, and created no liability on the part of the United States for which it was suable; that the cause of action in no way concerned a vessel employed as a merchant vessel; that the Suits in Admiralty Act was to prevent the arrest and detention of vessels owned or possessed by the United States then employed as merchant vessels, and it was only to prevent such arrest and detention and consequent interference with the operation of such vessels that the United States consented by the act to be sued in respect to such vessels, and that the United States had never consented by the act or otherwise to be sued in respect to a wreck or any object incapable of being employed as a merchant vessel; that the suit in personam provided for by the act was intended by Congress to be only a substitute for a suit in rem against such vessel itself, and by the terms of the act could be brought and maintained only in cases where, if such vessel were privately owned, a suit in rem could be maintained against her at the time of the commencement of such action, and not then unless such vessel was employed as a merchant vessel at that time; that section 15 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (Comp. St.  9920), making it the duty of the owner of any vessel or craft wrecked and sunk in a navigable channel immediately to mark it with a buoy or beacon by day and a lighted lantern at night, had no application to the United States of America, imposed no duty upon it, and created no liability for which it was suable in the District Court below or elsewhere.\n This issue on jurisdiction was presented by a motion to dismiss, which was denied by the District Judge, on the ground that the question should be determined after the facts were elicited in the trial of the case. 283 F. 1015. Subsequently the judge reheard the suggestion of want of \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 684]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction, and reached the conclusion on the facts alleged that the court was without jurisdiction, and dismissed the libel.\n The record shows that by consent of the other parties the Seaboard Transportation Company has been dismissed for reasons appearing to the court and to counsel. It further appears that all questions of mere venue are waived.\n This appeal, upon a certificate of the District Judge that the dismissal had been solely for lack of jurisdiction, was brought directly to this court on March 20, 1925, under section 238 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1215) as it was before it was amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, in accordance with section 14 of that act (43 Stat. 936, c. 229).\n The case before us turns on the proper construction of the Suits in Admiralty Act. It was passed March 9, 1920. 41 Stat. at Large 525, c. 95. Its first section provides that no vessel owned by the United States or by any corporation in which the United States or its representatives owns the entire outstanding capital stock shall thereafter 'in view of the provision herein made for libel in personam be subject to arrest or seizure by judicial process in the United States or its possessions.'\n By section 2, in cases where, if such vessel were privately owned or operated, or if such cargo were privately owned and possessed, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained at the time of the commencement of the action, a lible in personam may be brought against the United States if the vessel is employed as a merchant vessel. The suit is to be in a District Court of the United States for the district in which the parties suing reside, or at their principal place of business or in which the vessel or cargo charged with liability is found. The libelant is forthwith to serve a copy of his libel on the United States attorney for such district, and mail a copy thereof to the Attorney General, and make a sworn return of such service and \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 685]\n\u00a0\n mailing to constitute valid service on the United States and the corporation.\n The third section provides that the suits shall proceed and be heard according to principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties. A decree against the United States or such corporation may include costs of suit, and when the decree is for a money judgment, it shall include interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum until satisfied, or at any higher rate which shall be stipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based. Interest is to run as ordered by the court. The decrees are subject to appeal and revision as now provided in other cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Then follows this language:\n'If the libelant so elects in his libel the suit may proceed in accordance with the principles of libels in rem wherever it shall appear that had the vessel or cargo been privately owned and possessed a libel in rem might have been maintained. Election so to proceed shall not preclude the libelant in any proper case from seeking relief in personam in the same suit.'\n\n The United States is exempted from giving any bond, but it assumes liability to satisfy and decree in any cause in which a vessel of the United States has been arrested or in which a vessel previously possessed, owned or operated by the United States has been arrested in which the United States is interested and of which it desires release as suggested by the Attorney General.\n Section 6 directs that the United States shall be entitled to the benefits of all exemptions and of all limitations of liability accorded by law to the owners, charterers, operators, or agents of vessels.\n Section 7 provides that if any vessel or cargo of the United States is seized by process of a court of any country other than the United States, the Secretary of \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 686]\n\u00a0\n State of the United States is his discretion upon the request of the Attorney General direct the proper United States consul to claim immunity from such suit and seizure and to execute a bond on behalf of the United States as the court may require for the release of the vessel or cargo.\n Section 8 appropriates the sums needed to meet the final judgments against the United States authorized by the sections of the act.\n In view of the fact that the wreck which did the damage was a total loss, we assume that there is no res upon which a recovery in rem could be based, and therefore that a suit as between private persons, if maintainable, must rest on the personal liability of the owner of the wreck and must be in principle in personam, as distinguished from an action in rem against the vessel wrecked. Hence it is that the libelant must establish that under the Suits in Admiralty Act it was intended to give an action against the United States both in cases where the owner of the vessel would be personally liable, and in those where only the vessel would be liable.\n The sovereignty of the United States raises a presumption against its suability, unless it is clearly shown; nor should a court enlarge its liability to suit conferred beyond what the language requires. It was this view which led us in Blamberg Bros. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 452\n, 43 S. Ct. 179, to hold that as the substitution by the Suits in Admiralty Act was merely to furnish a balancing consideration for the immunity of the United States from seizure of its vessels employed as merchant vessels previously permitted, the act did not apply in cases in which the seizure of a merchant vessel of the United States could not be prevented by the act in a foreign port and court, where the immunity declared by Congress could not be given effect.\n In the case at bar the liability charged in this libel arose from occurrences under the Act of March 3, 1899, \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 687]\n\u00a0\n c. 425, 30 Stat. 1121, 1152,  15. The act is one making appropriations for the construction, repair and preservation of certain public works and rivers and harbors and contains regulations for the establishment of harbor lines and for the removal of obstructions in navigable waters of the United States.\n Its section 15 provides, among other things, that whenever a vessel, raft, or other craft is wrecked and sunk in a navigable channel, it shall be the duty of the owner of such sunken craft immediately to mark it with a buoy or beacon during the day and a lighted lantern at night, and to maintain such marks until the sunken craft is removed or abandoned; that the neglect or failure of the said owner so to do shall be unlawful; that it shall be the duty of the owner of such sunken craft to commence the immediate removal of the same and prosecute such removal diligently, and failure to do so shall be construed as an abandonment of such craft and subject the same to removal by the United States as thereinafter provided.\n Section 16 (Comp. St.  9921) provides for penalties of fine or imprisonment for the violation of section 15 as for a misdemeanor, or by both, and provides that the wrecked vessel may be proceeded against summarily by way of libel in any District Court in the United States having jurisdiction.\n Section 19 (Comp. St.  9924) provides for a period of 30 days before abandonment is complete unless legally established in less time. Under the averments of the libel there is no presumption of abandonment, certainly not within the 30 days, merely to relieve the owner of the wreck of his affirmative duty during that time to protect commerce against its danger. People's Coal Co. v. Second Pool Coal Co. (D. C.) 181 F. 609, affirmed (C. C. A.) 188 F. 892. We do not think that abandonment is a factor in this case.\n It is first objected to the recovery here that it was not intended by the Suits in Admiralty Act to subject the United States itself to prosecution for a crime which it \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 688]\n\u00a0\n denounces in its legislation. We need not be troubled by this objection, because there is no attempt here to prosecute the United States or any of its agents criminally. The declaration that the leaving of a wreck in a navigable channel in a place dangerous to passing steamers without notice of the danger and without immediate removal is unlawful, makes such omission a maritime tort which, if merchant vessels of the United States are to respond in tort, may be recovered for in its admiralty courts against the United States without anomaly. The Fahy (C. C. A.) 153 F. 866; The Macy (C. C. A.) 170 F. 930; People's Coal Co. (D. C.) 181 F. 609; Id. ( C. C. A.) 188 F. 893. Under the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505) and the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, of course, the United States is made liable only upon a contract express or implied, and not for a tort; but its liability provided for in the Suits in Admiralty Act cannot be limited to contracts any more than the liability of its merchant vessels under the Shipping Act of 1916 could be so limited. The Lake Monroe, \n250 \nU.S. 246\n, 39 S. Ct. 460.\n By the Shipping Act of 1916, approved September 7, 1916 (39 Stat. 729, c. 451 (Comp. St.  8146a et seq.)), the United States Shipping Board was established for the purpose of encouraging, developing, and creating a naval auxiliary and naval reserve and a merchant marine to meet the requirements of the commerce of the United States, and authority was given to that board to purchase, lease, or charter vessels suitable, as far as the commercial requirements of trade of the United States might permit. By section 9, any such vessel while employed solely as a merchant vessel was made subject to all laws, regulations, and liabilities governing merchant vessels, when the United States was interested therein as owner in whole or in part, or otherwise. It was under this provision that vessels belonging to the United States engaged as merchant vessels were arrested and held in an action in rem. In The Lake Monroe, \n250 \nU.S. 246\n, 39 S. Ct. 460, we decided that such a merchant vessel was subject \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 689]\n\u00a0\n to judicial process in admiralty for the consequences of a collision. It would seem clearly to follow that, under the act of 1916, if a wreck of a merchant vessel of the United States in a navigable channel, not properly protected, caused damage to a vessel navigating the channel, the owner of the latter would have a remedy in rem against the wreck. Had the Suits in Admiralty Act not been passed, and had the wreck become a total loss, there is nothing in the previous legislation, in the act of 1916, or elsewhere, by which the government could be made generally liable like a private owner for damages for failure to protect vessels against the wreck under the act of 1899\n\n\n Did the Suits in Admiralty Act intend to extend and expand the in rem liability, so as to make the United States so generally liable?\n As we have already intimated, the main purpose of the act of relieving United States merchant vessels from seizure and arrest would lead us to limit the operation of the act to such a remedy as would be commensurate only with the immunity from seizure extended by the act to United States mechant vessels and to a proceeding which while in form in personam would be attended only with the incidents of a proceeding in rem as if against a vessel libeled, arrested, and released under a stipulation or bond by the United States to pay all damages. In spite of the purpose of the act to create a substitute for a suit in rem, however, we are forced to the view, by the language used in sections 3 and 6, that it must be construed to have a wider effect than that which its section 1 would lead us to expect. The second section declares that in cases of immunity from arrest provided for in the first section, where, if the vessel or cargo had been privately owned or possessed, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained at the commencement of the action, a libel in personam may be brought against the United \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 690]\n\u00a0\n States. The expression 'a proceeding in admiralty' is broad enough to cover both a libel in personam and a libel in rem; but, if that were all, we could properly limit its scope, purpose, and incidents to that of a suit in rem merely transmuted into the form of an action in personam. The third section, however, provides that, if the libelant so elects in his libel, the suit may proceed in accordance with the principles of libels in rem wherever it shall appear that, had the vessel or cargo been privately owned or possessed, a libel in rem might have been maintained, but it then proceeds to say:\n'But election so to proceed shall not preclude the libelant in any proper case from seeking relief in personam in the same suit.'\n\n It is impossible to reconcile this language with the idea that the action provided for is one which in form only is in personam against the United States, but which in fact is one having the limitations, operation, and result of a suit in rem. The words certainly assume that there may be proper cases under the act in which there is to be a remedy really in personam against the United States, and also one in substance in rem against its vessels, for which its own personal liability is substituted. We have heard no suggestion or hypothesis which satisfies the provision for this double remedy thus expressly given, which would not include the general in personam liability of the United States as the owner of an offending vessel like that of a private owner.\n This view is further borne out by the sixth section, which provides that the United States shall be entitled to the benefit of all exemptions and of all limitations of liability accorded by law to the owners, charterers, operators or agents of vessels. The necessary implication is that if, under the Harter Act (chapter 105, 27 Stat. 445 (Comp. St.  8029-8035)), or the Limitation of Liability Act (sections 4282-4287, R. S. ( Comp. St.  8020-8025)), the United States as owner of a merchant vessel should not be able to show performance of the conditions upon \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 691]\n\u00a0\n which such statutory limitations of liability are granted, it must assume the personal liability for negligence in such cases exactly as a private owner would.\n This construction of sections 2, 3, and 6 is sustained by the weight of authority in the lower courts. Agros Corporation v. United States (D. C .) 8 F. (2d) 84; The Anna E. Morse, 287 F. 364; Bashinsky Cotton Co. v. United States (D. C.) 8 F.(2d) 79; Markle v. United States (D. C.) 8 F.(2d) 87; Cross v. United States (D. C.) 8 F.(2d) 86; Benedict on Admiralty (5th Ed.) vol. 1,  194.\n Do Blamberg v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 452\n, 43 S. Ct. 179, Shewan & Sons v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 108\n, 45 S. Ct. 45, and Nahmeh v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 122\n, 45 S. Ct. 277, militate against this view? In those cases the court emphasized the main purpose in the act to be to rid the United States of the inconvenience to which it and its subordinate Shipping Corporations were subjected by having their vessels in the merchant trade arrested and seized under the Shipping Act of 1916, by substituting therefor a suit in personam against the United States with consequent appropriations to meet the liability thus imposed. We did not then have before us the question whether the statute substituted a remedy limited to what an action in rem would be with a statutory stipulation and bond of the United States to take the place of the vessel, or whether it created a broader personal obligation of the United States, both personal and in rem, like that of the private owner of a vessel. The question in the Blamberg Case was whether the act applied at all in cases in which there could be no immunity granted by Congress to vessels of the United States. The Shewan Case only involved the question whether that which had been a merchant vessel of the United States continued to be such and satisfied the act, if it were laid up and had not been changed to be a public vessel of the United States. The Nahmeh Case was one of venue as to the District Courts in which \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 692]\n\u00a0\n suits could be brought under the act; that is, whether only one of three courts described in the act, or any one of the three, could be used in each instance. Neither case involved the important question now before us, and while the emphasis placed in those cases upon the main purpose of the act as that of the mere substitution of a remedy for a proceeding in rem against merchant vessels of the United States and its effect on its interpretation may have been too marked, there is nothing in their decision inconsistent with the conclusion which we have here reached.\n It is finally insisted for the government that recovery against the government under the Suits in Admiralty Act, whether in personam and in rem, must be on a cause of action related to or growing out of the operation of government vessels employed as merchant vessels, and that as the collision with the wreck was not with a vessel employed as a merchant vessel, the act does not apply. We think this reasoning to be too fine. What the statute means by saying 'employed as a merchant vessel' is that the vessel shall belong to that class as distinguished from one employed in the governmental service, not necessarily that it shall be actively thus employed at the time of the collision. Shewan & Sons v. United States, supra. The cause of action grows out of the responsibility of the government for a merchant vessel which in the course of its employment had become a danger to navigation and which imposed a duty to avoid that danger. A wreck which is a total loss will not furnish basis for an action in rem, as we have assumed, but if a proceeding in admiralty permitted by the act embraces the principles both of suits in personam and suits in rem, it is a most natural construction of the act dealing with merchant vessels employed by the United States, to include as a suit in personam it permits, one for a tort caused by the negligence of the United \n\n[272 U.S. 675, 693]\n\u00a0\n States in dealing with a wreck of its merchant vessel and its failure to comply with its own navigation laws therewith.\n The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEASTMAN KODAK CO.

The defendant, appearing specially, traversed the return, entered a plea to the jurisdiction, and moved to quash the service. The jurisdictional issues thus raised were tried by the judge, who overruled \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n these defenses. (D. C.) 234 F. 955. The defendant, by leave of court, then answered on the merits. The trial to the court and jury resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff assessing its actual damages at $7,914.66. Judgment was entered against the defendant for triple this amount and an attorney's fee. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. ,295 F. 98. And the case was then brought here by writ of error, prior to the Jurisdictional Act of 1925 (43 Stat. 936).\n The plaintiff operates a photographic stock house in Atlanta and deals in photographic materials and supplies, which it sells to photographers in Georgia and other Southern States. The defendant is a manufacturer of photographic materials and supplies, which it sells to dealers throughout the United States.\n The case made by the allegations of the complaint was, in substance, this: The defendant, in violation of the Anti-Trust Act, had engaged in a combination to monopolize the interstate trade in the United States in photographic materials and supplies, and had monopolized the greater part of such interstate trade. This had been brought about by purchasing and acquiring the control of competing companies engaged in manufacturing such materials, and the businesses and stock houses of dealers; by restraining the vendors from re-entering these businesses; by imposing on the dealers to whom it sold goods restrictive terms of sale fixing the prices at which its goods could be resold and preventing them from handling competitive goods; and by other means of suppressing competition.\n Prior to 1910 the plaintiff had dealt with the defendant and purchased its goods on the same terms as other dealers, with whom it was enabled to compete; but in that year the defendant, having acquired the control of the stock houses in Atlanta which were in competition with the plaintiff and unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the plaintiff's business, had, in furtherance of its purpose to \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n monopolize, thereafter refused to sell the plaintiff its goods at the dealers' discounts, and would no longer furnish them except at the retail prices at which they were sold by other dealers and the agencies which the defendant owned and controlled, with whom the plaintiff could no longer compete. And, the plaintiff being thus deprived, by reason of the monopoly, of the ability to obtain the defendant's goods and supply them to its trade, its business had been greatly injured and it had sustained large damages in the loss of the profits which it would have realized in the four years covered by the suit had it been able to continue the purchase and sale of such goods.\n The answer denied that the defendant had combined to monopolize or monopolized interstate trade, or refused to sell its goods to the plaintiff at the dealers' discounts in furtherance of a purpose to monopolize; and averred that the defendant had not only committed no actionable wrong, but that in any event the plaintiff had sustained no damages capable of ascertainment upon any legal basis.\n While many errors were assigned, some of which were also specified, in general terms, in the defendant's brief in this Court, we confine our consideration of the case in this opinion to the controlling questions which are stated in that brief to present the chief issues here in controversy, and to which alone the argument in the brief is directed.

These do not involve the existence of the defendant's monopoly-which is not questioned here3-but relate solely to the questions whether there \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 370]\n\u00a0\n was local jurisdiction or venue in the District Court; whether the refusal of the defendant to continue to sell the plaintiff its goods at the dealers' discounts was in furtherance of a purpose to monopolize and constituted an actionable wrong which could form the basis of any recovery; and whether there was any competent and legal proof on which a measurement of the plaintiff's damages could be based.\n\n 1. \nWhether or not the jurisdiction of the District Court was rightly sustained-which resolves itself into a question whether the venue of the suit was properly laid in that court-depends upon the construction and effect of section 12 of the Clayton Act and its application to the facts shown by the evidence set forth in the separate bill of exceptions relating to the hearing on the jurisdictional issues. Dunlop v. Munroe, 7 Cranch, 242, 270; Jones v. Buckell, \n104 U.S. 554\n, 556.\n It appears from this evidence that the defendant-which resides and has its principal place of business in New York-had not registered in Georgia as a non-resident corporation for the purpose of doing business in that State, and had no office, place of business or resident agent therein. It had, however, for many years prior to the institution of the suit, in a continuous course of business, carried on interstate trade with a large number of photographic dealers in Atlanta and other places in Georgia, to whom it sold and shipped photographic materials from New York. A large part of this business was obtained through its traveling salesmen who visited Georgia several times in each year and solicited orders from these dealers, which were transmitted to its New York offices for acceptance or rejection. In furtherance of its business and to increase the demand for its goods, it also employed travelling 'demonstrators,' who visited Georgia several times in each year, for the purpose of exhibiting and explaining the superiority of its goods to photographers and other \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 371]\n\u00a0\n users of photographic materials. And, although these demonstrators did not solicit orders for the defendant's goods, they took at times retail orders for them from such users, which they turned over to the local dealers supplied by the defendant.\n It is clear that upon these facts this suit could not have been maintained in the Georgia district under the original provision in section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8829) that anyone injured in his person or property 'by any other person or corporation' by reason of anything declared to be unlawful by the Act, might sue therefor 'in the district in which the defendant 'resides or is found.\"4 In People's Tobacco Co. v. Am. Tobacco Co., \n246 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 86 S., 38 S. Ct. 233, 234 ( 62 L. Ed. 587, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 537) decided in 1918, it was held that this provision, as applied to a corporation sued in a district in which it did not reside, required that it 'be present in the district by its officers and agents carrying on the business of the corporation,' this being the only way in which it could be said to be 'found' within the district; that to make it amenable to service of process in the district, the business must be of such nature and character as to warrant the inference that it had subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and was by its duly authorized officers or agents present therein; and that advertising its goods in a state and sending its soliciting agents therein, did not amount to 'that doing of business' which subjected it to the local jurisdiction for the purpose of serving process upon it.\n Manifestly the defendant was not present in the Georgia district through officers or agents engaged in carrying on business of such character that it was 'found' in that district and was amenable to the local jurisdiction for the service of process. \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 372]\n\u00a0\n However, by the Clayton Act-which supplemented the former laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies of interstate trade-the local jurisdiction of the district courts was materially enlarged in reference to suits against corporations. By section 4 of that Act (Comp. St.  8835d) it was provided that any person 'injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the anti-trust laws' might sue therefor in the district 'in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent.' Whether, as applied to suits against corporations, as distinguished from those against individuals, the insertion of the words 'or has an agent' in this section can be held, in the light of the decision in the People's Tobacco Co. Case, to have enlarged to any extent the jurisdictional provision in section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act, we need not here determine. Be that as it may, it is clear that such an enlargement was made by section 12 of the Clayton Act (Comp. St.  8835k)-dealing specifically with the venue and service of process in suits against corporations-under which the plaintiff proceeded in the present case. This provided that 'any suit, action, or proceeding under the anti-trust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found.' That this section altered the venue provisions in respect to suit under the anti-trust laws was pointed out in General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore Ry., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 279\n, 43 S. Ct. 106. And we think it clear that, as applied to suits against corporations for injuries sustained by violations of the Anti-Trust Act, its necessary effect was to enlarge the local jurisdiction of the district courts so as to establish the venue of such a suit not only, as theretofore, in a district in which the corporation resides or is 'found,' but also in any district in which it 'transacts business'- \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 373]\n\u00a0\n -although neither residing nor 'found' therein-in which case the process may be issued to and served in a district in which the corporation either resides or is 'found'; and, further, that a corporation is engaged in transacting business in a district, within the meaning of this section, in such sense as to establish the venue of a suit-although not present by agents carrying on business of such character and in such manner that it is 'found' therein and is amenable to local process-if in fact, in the ordinary and usual sense, it 'transacts business' therein of any substantial character. This construction is in accordance, not only with that given this section by the two lower courts in the present case, but also with the decisions in Frey & Son v. Cudahy Packing Co. (D. C.) 228 F. 209, 213, and Haskell v. Aluminum Co. of America (D. C.) 14 F.(2d) 864, 869. And see Green v. Chicago, B. & Q. Ry., \n205 \nU.S. 530, 533\n, 27 S. Ct. 595, in which it was recognized that a corporation engaged in the solicitation of orders in a district was in fact 'doing business' therein, although not in such sense that process could be there served upon it.\n We are further of opinion that a corporation is none the less engaged in transacting business in a district, within the meaning of this section- which deals with suits respecting unlawful restraints upon interstate trade-because of the fact that such business may be entirely interstate in character and be transacted by agents who do not reside within the district. And see International Harvester v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 579, 587\n, 34 S. Ct. 944; Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 43 S. Ct. 556.\n Thus construed, this section supplements the remedial provision of the Anti-Trust Act for the redress of injuries resulting from illegal restraints upon interstate trade, by relieving the injured person from the necessity of resorting for the redress of wrongs committed by a nonresident corporation, to a district, however distant, in which it \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 374]\n\u00a0\n resides or may be 'found'-often an insuperable obstacle-and enabling him to institute the suit in a district, frequently that of his own residence, in which the corporation in fact transacts business, and bring it before the court by the service of process in a district in which it resides or may be 'found.'\n To construe the words 'or transacts business' as adding nothing of substance to the meaning of the words 'or is found,' as used in the Anti- Trust Act, and as still requiring that the suit be brought in a district in which the corporation resides or is 'found,' would to that extent defeat the plain purpose of this section and leave no occasion for the provision that the process might be served in a district in which the corporation resides or is found. And we find nothing in the legislative proceedings leading to its enactment which requires or justifies such a construction.\n That Congress may, in the exercise of its legislative discretion, fix the venue of a civil action in a federal court in one district, and authorize the process to be issued to another district in which the defendant resides or is found, is not open to question. United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n98 U.S. 569\n, 604; Robertson v. Labor Board, \n268 \nU.S. 619, 622\n, 45 S. Ct. 621\n\n\n And, since it appears from the facts already stated that the defendant, in a continuous course of business, was engaged, not only in selling and shipping its goods to dealers within the Georgia district, but also in soliciting orders therein through its salesmen and promoting the demand for its goods through its demonstrators for the purpose of increasing its sales, we conclude that it was transacting business in that district, within the meaning of section 12 of the Clayton Act, in such sense as properly established the venue of the suit; that it was duly brought before the court by the service of process in the New York district, in which it resided and was 'found'; and that its jurisdictional defenses were rightly overruled. \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 375]\n\u00a0\n 2. On the question whether the defendant's refusal to sell its goods to the plaintiff at dealers' discounts was in furtherance of a purpose to monopolize and constituted an actionable wrong, the defendant contends not only that there was no direct evidence as to the purpose of such refusal overcoming the presumption that it was a lawful one, but that such refusal was justified by the fact that the plaintiff had previously undertaken to handle the goods of another manufacturer under a preferential contract. Aside from the plaintiff's contention that this contract related merely to goods that did not conflict with the sale of those which it had been purchasing from the defendant, it was not shown that the defendant knew of this contract when it refused to sell its goods to the plaintiff. And for this reason, if for no other, we think that the trial court rightly declined to charge the jury to the effect that such taking over of other goods by the plaintiff in itself justified the defendant in its refusal to sell to the plaintiff. And, although there was no direct evidence-as there could not well be-that the defendant's refusal to sell to the plaintiff was in pursuance of a purpose to monopolize, we think that the circumstances disclosed in the evidence sufficiently tended to indicate such purpose, as a matter of just and reasonable inference, to warrant the submission of this question to the jury. 'Clearly,' as was said by the Court of Appeals, 'it could not be held as a matter of law that the defendant was actuated by innocent motives rather than by an intention and desire to perpetuate a monopoly.' This question was submitted under proper instructions. And the weight of the evidence being in such case exclusively a question for the jury, its determination is conclusive upon this question of fact. Crumpton v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 361, 363\n, 11 S. Ct. 355; Anvil Mining Co. v. Humble, \n153 \nU.S. 540, 554\n, 14 S. Ct. 876; and see Johnson v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 320, 326\n, 15 S. Ct. 614; Goldman v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 474, 477\n, 38 S. Ct. 166.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 359, 376]\n\u00a0\n 3. On the question of the amount of damages, there was substantial evidence to the effect that prior to 1910 the plaintiff had an established business in selling supplies used by professionel photographers, of which it carried a complete line, purchased in large part from the defendant; that the defendant sold to dealers such supplies only; that shortly before the defendant's refusal to continue the sale of its goods the plaintiff also took on a complete line of goods used by amateurs, which did not conflict with its sales to professional photographers; that after the defendant's refusal, the plaintiff was unable, by reason of the defendant's monopoly, to obtain and supply the greater part of the goods necessary to professional photographers, and lost its established trade in such goods; that its trade with professional photographers greatly decreased; and that its business was so organized that it would have been able to continue to handle the defendant's goods during the period in suit with no increase in its general expenses and no additional cost except that incident to the handling of such goods themselves-its business being operated during such period at only two-thirds of its capacity. The plaintiff's claim was that under these circumstances it was entitled to recover, as the loss of profits which it would have realized had it been able to continue the purchase of defendant's goods, the amount of its gross profits on the defendant's goods during the four years preceding the period in suit, which was shown, less the additional expense which it would have incurred in handling the defendant's goods during the four years' period in suit, which was estimated.\n The defendant-while conceding that the loss of anticipated profits from the destruction or interruption of an established business may be recovered where the amount of the loss is made reasonably certain by competent proof, Central Coal & Coke Co. v. Hartman (C. C. A.) 111 F. 96, 98-contends that there was a lack of com- \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 377]\n\u00a0\n petent proof of such damages in that the profits earned by the plaintiff during the preceding four years in which it had been a customer of the defendant, were improperly used as a standard by which to measure the damages sustained by the plaintiff during the period covered by the suit, since during such preceding years it had participated in the defendant's unlawful acts in furtherance of the monopoly and was in pari delicto.\n There was, as stated by the Court of Appeals, evidence from which the jury could justly reach the conclusion that the plaintiff was not a party to the monopoly in pari delicto with the defendant, and that the plaintiff had complied with the defendant's restricted terms of sale merely for the reason that otherwise it could not purchase or secure the goods necessary in the conduct of its business. There was also affirmative evidence, not contradicted, tending to show that under the defendant's restricted terms of sale the dealers' profits did not exceed those on the sale of goods of other manufacturers not parties to the monopoly.\n The jury was instructed, in substance, that if, during the preceding period in which the plaintiff had been a customer of the defendant, it had not merely bought goods from the defendant because of a business necessity, but, with a knowledge of the defendant's purpose to monopolize, had knowingly and willfully helped to build up the monopoly, it was in pari delicto, and hence could not recover any damages whatever on account of the defendant's refusal to continue to sell it goods; and, further, that even if the plaintiff had not been a party to the monopoly, it could not recover damages on the basis of the profits which it had earned while a customer of the defendant to the extent that they had been increased by the monopoly and exceeded those in a normal business, but that they must be reduced to the basis of normal profits.\n We find, under the circumstances of this case, nothing in these instructions of which the defendant may justly \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 378]\n\u00a0\n complain. See Ramsay Co. v. Bill Posters' Ass'n, \n260 \nU.S. 501, 512\n, 43 S. Ct. 167. The statement in Victor Talking Mach. Co. v. Kemeny (C. C. A.) 271 F. 810, 819, on which the defendant relies was based on the assumptions that the plaintiff had not only been a party to the unlawful combination, but that his earlier profits had exceeded those which 'he could earn lawfully in a competitive market.' And in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Blackmore (C. C. A.) 277 F. 694, 699, 21 A. L. R. 1506, the substance of the holding was that the profits made by the plaintiff during an earlier period ending in 1902, in which he had actively participated in the unlawful combination, could not be set up as the standard of the profits which he would have realized in a much later period commencing in 1908.\n The defendant further contends that, apart from this question the plaintiff's damages were purely speculative, not proved by any facts from which they were logically and legally inferable, and not of an amount susceptible of expression in figures, Keogh v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 156, 165\n, 43 S. Ct. 47. In support of this contention it is urged in argument, inter alia, that there was no showing as to the separate cost of handling the defendant's goods during the preceding four years; that if the plaintiff's entire business be considered as a unit and the total expenses and costs of goods be deducted from the entire receipts, it is shown to have had a net loss in the two years preceding 1910, but to have made a substantial net profit in that and the succeeding year; that the estimate as to the additional expense which the plaintiff would have incurred in handling the defendant's goods during the period in suit, was purely conjectural and speculative; and that it was a mere assumption, discredited by the testimony, that the plaintiff could have sold as large a quantity of the defendant's goods during the period in suit, after taking over a line of other goods, as it had before.\n As to this question the Court of Appeals-after stating that in its opinion the plaintiff's evidence would have sup- \n\n[273 U.S. 359, 379]\n\u00a0\n ported a much larger verdict than that returned by the jury-said:\n'The plaintiff had an established business, and the future profits could be shown by past experience. It was permissible to arrive at net profits by deducting from the gross profits of an earlier period an estimated expense of doing business. Damages are not rendered uncertain because they cannot be calculated with absolute exactness. It is sufficient if a reasonable basis of computation is afforded, although the result be only approximate.'\n\n This, we think, was a correct statement of the applicable rules of law. Furthermore, a defendant whose wrongful conduct has rendered difficult the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered by the plaintiff, is not entitled to complain that they cannot be measured with the same exactness and precision as would otherwise be possible. Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., \n169 \nU.S. 26, 39\n, 18 S. Ct. 255; and see Lincoln v. Orthwein (C. C. A.) 120 F. 880, 886.\n We conclude that plaintiff's evidence as to the amount of damages, while mainly circumstantial, was competent, and that it sufficiently showed the extent of the damages, as a matter of just and reasonable inference, to warrant the submission of this question to the jury. The jury was instructed, in effect, that the amount of the damages could not be determined by mere speculation or guess, but must be based on evidence furnishing data from which the amount of the probable loss could be ascertained as a matter of reasonable inference. And the question as to the amount of the plaintiff's damages having been properly submitted to the jury, its determination as to this matter is conclusive.\n The judgment is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp.

CO.(1927)\nNo. 70\nArgued: December 10, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. T. Manning, Jr., and William J. Conlen, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. J. Hamilton Cheston, of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error. \n\n[272 U.S. 709, 710]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Norfolk & Western Railway Company to recover demurrage on cars at Lambert's Point, Virginia, from the Emmons Coal Mining Company and its surety. An affidavit of defence upon matters of law was filed, but was held insufficient by the District Court, and judgment subsequently was entered for the plaintiff. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 3 F.(2d) 525.\n To facilitate the delivery of coal at tidewater some of the owners of mines upon the lines of the Railway made an arrangement with the latter by which the cars were sorted at Lambert's Point upon different tracks according to the quality of the coal, and delivery was made to their respective customers from the cars most convenient at the moment, irrespective of ownership, if the seller had that amount of coal on hand in cars within the space limits agreed. To work this out the parties formed an association, called the Lambert's Point Coal Exchange, with a manager who kept books in which he credited to each owner coal destined to the Point as soon as it passed Bluefield, West Virginia, noting its quality, and ordered delivery within the amount so credited, as required, to the owner's customers. If the delivery were required to be from the consignor's own cars, as it would be in the absence of agreement, of course if the cars were detained beyond the allowed time demurrage would be payable. When under the arrangement one member's cars were emptied to fill the order of another member, other cars with similar coal would have to be kept, in order to satisfy the first member's right when it came to assert it, and it should pay as in the first case, since the delay would be the same to the railroad whichever of its cars were detained. The responsibility of the owner for them is the \n\n[272 U.S. 709, 711]\n\u00a0\n natural corollary of the benefit that each owner gets by having its order filled from the nearest cars.\n In the present case the demurrage demanded is fixed by the foregoing rule. The plaintiffs in error say that by the tariff that governs the matter they can be charged only for the cars actually used and detained by them; that to make the tariff cover a substitution it must be modified by the rules of the Exchange, which cannot be done, and that if there is a claim against any one, it is a claim against the Lambert's Point Coal Exchange.\n The last point may be dispatched in a few words. The articles of organization of the Exchange provide that the member shall be responsible to the Railway for demurrage, and that the shipping instructions, etc., 'shall show as the consignee the name of the member for whose account shipped, followed by the words 'care Lambert's Point Coal Exchange Pool.\" The Coal Company's consignments were in accordance with the agreement, and by the agreement or without it made the Company the consignee. We come therefore to the tariff the construction of which is the only point much argued in the case.\n The important clauses are in Rule 3, and Rule 4.\n'(b) A car shall be considered as released:\n\n'1. At the time vessel registers for the cargo or fuel supply of which the coal, coal briquets or coke dumped into such vessel is a part, except that when cars are unloaded before the vessel registers such cars shall be released when unloaded.\n\n'2. To avoid delay that would be entailed in switching out and delivering on shipper's order, in actual sequence of arrival, cars containing the same grade of coal, as indicated by the identifying consigning names or numbers on the waybills, the dates on which cars should have been so released (as indicated by the record) will be substituted for the dates on which equivalent tonnage \n\n[272 U.S. 709, 712]\n\u00a0\n was actually delivered and the detention will be computed on the basis of such substituted dates.\n\n'3. The dates shipments are transferred by written order and acceptance to another party shall be considered the date of release of the car for the account of the original consignee and subsequent detention shall be charged in the account of the new consignee without any free time allowance.'\n\n'Rule 4.-Demurrage Charges.\n\n'Settlement shall be made on the basis of detention to all cars released during the month. The date of arrival notice shall be subtracted from the date of release. From the total days detention to all cars thus obtained, deduct all Sundays and legal holidays following the date of arrival and five (5) days free time allowance for each car, except on cars containing coke for export deduct ten ( 10) days free time allowance for each car; the remainder, if any, will be the number of days to be charged at the rate of $2.00 per car per day. Excess credit days of any one month cannot be deducted from the excess debit days of another month.'\n\n These clauses were construed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in an able opinion as authorizing the 'substitution of any car containing a similar grade of coal for the one ordered dumped,' when the parties have so agreed, and as warranting the charges questioned here. They also were held reasonable as so construed. Smokeless Fuel Co. v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co., 85 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 395. The matter is one upon which the opinion of the Commission would carry great weight, even if we thought its conclusion less obvious than we do. See also Smokeless Fuel Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 142 Va. 355, 128 S. E. 624. The fairness and reasonableness of it ought to prevail against meticulous arguments drawn from the fact that \n\n[272 U.S. 709, 713]\n\u00a0\n the rules are made with unassociated shippers most prominently in mind, or from rarely realized possibilities of demurrage being charged where coal is delivered on the credit of cars actually in transit from Bluefield, although those cars are not delayed. In the ordinary course of things cars will be kept on hand to answer the mine owner's credit, and it is for its as well as for the Railway's advantage that they need not be the very cars that the mine owner has used.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEMPIRE TRUST CO. v.

The respondent, a Canadian lawyer, had accounts with the two banks named and in 1916 gave to his son powers of attorney to draw checks upon them, both powers being general and with no qualification as to the purposes for which such checks might be drawn. Beginning in July of that year and from time to time down to October, 1918, the son drew checks signed with his father's name by himself as attorney against his father's two accounts, payable seventeen to his own order, three to the order of the petitioner, and deposited them to his own private account with the petitioner. All the checks but two were certified by the Guaranty Trust Company or accepted by the other bank as the case might be. Subsequently the son drew out these funds and applied them to his own use. The respondent did not discover the fraud until the end of 1919, at which time his son absconded. The petitioner had no knowledge that the son was misappropriating his father's money and no notice other than what was given by the form of the checks. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that notice sufficient to charge the petitioner as matter of law and gave judgment against it, the Circuit Court of Appeals adding interest on the several items from the date when they were credited to the son. 9 F.

Ct. 482\n\n\n No doubt the question is, as was said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, a question of degree, like most questions in the law; but we are of opinion that the Court below applied too strict a rule to an ordinary business transaction. The Court itself pronounced it 'a hard rule as business is ordinarily conducted,' and seemingly adopted it as much because of authority by which it felt bound as because it confidently thought the rule right. \n\n[274 U.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner had notice that the checks were drawn upon the respondent's account, but they were drawn in pursuance of an unlimited authority. We do not perceive on what ground the petitioner could be held bound to assume that checks thus lawfully drawn were required to be held or used for one purpose rather than another. In the case of checks drawn by a corporation not likely to disburse except for corporate purposes there might be stronger reasons for requiring a bank to be on its guard if an officer having power to draw them deposited checks for considerable sums to his private account; but it recently has been held otherwise by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

And when the two parties are father and son, both of mature years and in good standing, secret limitations of the power are a pure matter of speculation into which it seems to us extravagant to expect the bank to inquire. The person reposing confidence in the son was not the petitioner but the respondent, National Safe Deposit, Savings & Trust Co. v. Hibbs, \n229 \nU.S. 391, 397\n, 33 S. Ct. 818; and he himself tells us that his confidence was unlimited. He put his deposits absolutely into his son's power, and the son, if he drew currency, as he might, could do with it as he saw fit. The notice to the bank was notice only of this relation of the parties. The petitioner in permitting the son to draw out the money was permitting only what it, like the respondent's banks, would have been bound to allow even if the deposit had been earmarked as a trust. The form in which the withdrawals took place does not appear. They might have been, like the deposits, in checks to the son's own order. All that is known is that the respondent did not get the benefit of them. But we do not place our decision upon that narrow ground. For in addition to what we have said, the transactions went on for over two years and the petitioner fairly might expect the respond- \n\n[274 U.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n ent to find it out in a month or two if anything was wrong. Careful people generally look over their bank accounts rather frequently.\n It is very desirable that the decision of the Courts of the United States and that of the highest Court of the State where the business was done, should agree, as was recognized by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The result to which we come restores that agreement, at least when the checks are certified or accepted by the banks upon which they are drawn, as was the case here with all but two. Whiting v. Hudson Trust Co., 234 N. Y. 394, 138 N. E. 33, 25 A. L. R. 1470. The certification did not import a statement by the certifying bank that, beside the right of the son to draw, established by the power of attorney, the purposes for which the checks were drawn were lawful and were known by the bank. As the Court remarks in the case cited:\n'The transactions of banking in a great financial centre are not to be clogged, or their pace slackened, by over-burdensome restrictions.' 234 N. Y. 406, 138 N. E. 37.\n\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEQUITABLE TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK v. ROCHLING(1927)\nNo. 34\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 248, 249]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Godfrey Goldmark, of New York City (Messrs. George G. Ernst and Ralph F. Colin, both of New York City, of counsel), for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry G. Hotchkiss, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 248, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, bankers of Frankfort-on-Main, maintained a general deposit account with the bankrupts, who were private bankers in New York City. On instruction of Lloyds Bank, Limited, London, which was requested by respondents 'to procure this amount for us' on June 15, 1923, 'at Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne, New York,' the National Bank of Commerce in New York on that day delivered to Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne, the bankrupts, its cashier's check for $30,000, payable to them 'for account of Rochling Bank, Gebr. Frankfort-on-Main,' and took from them their receipt for the check 'for account of Rochling Bank.' On instruction of the Swiss Bank, London, the National City Bank, New York, on the same date delivered its cashier's chock for $30,000, payable to the order of Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne, 'A\/C Gebr. Rochling, Frankfort A\/M,' taking from them a receipt in like form. On that day, too, the bankrupts credited the account of respondents with the two checks and made an entry on their books indicating that respondents were entitled to interest on the amount of the checks from that date. The checks were deposited by Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne in their own deposit accounts in other banks and were there credited to those accounts. On the following day, June 16, 1923, before the collection of the checks, the petition in bankruptcy was filed.\n In receiving these checks, forthwith crediting respondents with them, and in crediting interest from the date of their receipt, the bankrupts followed the established course of their business with respondent which had extended over a period of more than two years. Periodic statements of the account rendered to respondents showed that interest was credited from the day of deposit, and that on occasion drafts were made against deposits before they had been collected. \n\n[275 U.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n Respondents' petition, filed in the district court for southern New York, for reclamation of the proceeds of checks, was dismissed. The order of the district court was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 10 F.(2d) 935. This court granted certiorari. Borland v. Rochling, \n271 \nU.S. 653\n, 46 S. Ct. 483\n\n\n The proceeds of the two checks concededly have come into the hands of the petitioner, the bankrupts' trustee, and the sole question presented is whether the bankrupts on receipt of the check and before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy became the owners of them or whether, as the court of appeals held, Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne were respondents' agents to collect them. If the former, respondents were creditors of the bankrupts, Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n271 \nU.S. 489\n, 46 S. Ct. 554; Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283\n, 25 S. Ct. 243, entitled to share only on an equal footing with other creditors. If the latter respondents were entitled to reclamation from the petitioner since the checks had not been collected at the time of the petition in bankruptcy. St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. v. Johnston, \n133 \nU.S. 566\n, 10 S. Ct. 390; White v. Stump, \n266 \nU.S. 310, 313\n, 45 S. Ct. 103; Bankruptcy Act,  70(a), c. 541, 30 Stat. 565, as amended, section 16, c. 487, 32 Stat. 800 (11 USCA  107).\n Ordinarily, where paper is indorsed without restriction by a depositor and is at once placed to his credit by the bank, the inference is that the bank has become the purchaser of the paper and in making the collection is not acting as the agent of the depositor. Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank, supra; Burton v. United States, supra; In re Jarmulowsky (C. C. A.) 249 F. 319, 321, L. R. A. 1918E, 634. But the court below thought, and respondents argue here, that the form of the check directing payment to be made to the bankrupts 'for account of' the respondents operated to make them agents to collect the paper. The point is made that this is the effect of these or equivalent words where the payee of negotiable paper indorses it 'for \n\n[275 U.S. 248, 253]\n\u00a0\n account of' the indorser. It may be conceded that such an indorsement indicates that the transaction is not a purchase and sale of the paper and, at least when not otherwise explained or limited, may fairly be taken to mean that the interest gained by the indorsee is that of an agent for collection. White v. National Bank, \n102 U.S. 658\n; Evansville Bank v. German-American Bank, \n155 \nU.S. 556\n, 15 S. Ct. 221; Commercial Bank of Penn. v. Armstrong, \n148 \nU.S. 50, 57\n, 13 S. Ct. 533.\n Here, however, the words were used not by a payee in his indorsement, but by a third person making a deposit for respondents' benefit. They are thus of much less significance than in the usual case at data in determining the relation between respondents and the bankrupts, and the course of conduct of the parties becomes correspondingly more important. Moreover, the words themselves, despite their wide commercial use and the importance of giving them, as far as practicable, a uniform effect, have no rigid and unchangeable significance. Their purpose is to express intention. They are not an incantation which unfailingly invokes an agency. And the circumstances in this case indicate that they were here used with a different object.\n The dominant purpose of the entire transaction, as far as respondents were concerned, was to arrange that a credit with the bankrupts should be available on June 15, and this they accomplished as soon as the checks were delivered to the bankrupts. While we need not stress the point, the added facts that respondents were international bankers requiring the credit, in the course of their business, and that the credit was effected by the deposit of cashier's checks, which pass among bankers as current funds, are not without their significance. Nothing in the previous course of dealing or in the actions of respondents indicates that they intended or had any reason for intending that Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne should take the paper \n\n[275 U.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n as their agents for collection, or that any restriction should be placed on the use of the checks by Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne once they had credited respondents.\n Nor was there anything in the relationship to the transaction of the New York banks whose checks established the credit to suggest any reason or purpose so to restrict it. The duty of these banks was performed and their interest in the paper, apart from their liability to pay it, ceases as soon as they had delivered it to the bankrupts. But it was indispensable to the completion of the transaction that the bankrupts should be advised to what account the checks were to be credited. And it was apparently the function of the words in question to tell them. That alone, we think, was their purpose. To assign them any other would be to ignore the course of business followed here and banking usage in general, and to give them a strained and unnatural construction. We think the District Court was right, and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIRMONT CREAMERY CO. v. STATE OF MINN.(1927)\nNo. 725\nArgued: February 23, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leonard A. Flansburg and Eugene J. Hainer, both of Lincoln, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles E. Phillips, of St. Paul, Minn., for the State of Minnesota.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota sustained the conviction of plaintiff in error, a corporation of that state charged with violating section 1, chapter 305, Laws 1921, as amended by chapter 120, Laws 1923 (G. S. Minn. 1923,  3907), which follows:\n'Any person, firm, copartnership or corporation engaged in the business of buying milk, cream or butter fat for manufacture or for sale of such milk, cream or butter fat, who shall discriminate between different sections, localities, communities or cities of this state, by purchasing such commodity at a higher price or rate in one locality than is paid for the same commodity by said person, \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n firm, copartnership or corporation in another locality, after making due allowance for the difference, if any, in the actual cost of transportation from the locality of purchase to the locality of manufacture or locality of sale of such milk, cream or butter fat, shall be deemed guilty of unfair discrimination, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not exceeding 90 days.'\n\n Chapter 468, Laws 1909, prohibited discrimination in prices between localities 'with the intention of creating a monopoly or destroying the business of a competitor.' The act of 1921 forbade such discrimination with 'the purpose of creating a monopoly, or to restrain trade, or to prevent or limit competition, or to destroy the business of a competitor.' Section 1. The act of 1923, supra, eliminated purpose as an element of the offense.\n The cause was begun in Cottonwood county by a complaint which alleged: That the Fairmont Creamery Company on June 11, 1923, at the village of Bingham Lake, Cottonwood county, committed the crime of unfair discrimination in the purchase of butter fat for manufacture and sale, in the manner following: Said company, while engaged in the business of buying milk, cream, and butter fat for manufacture and sale and while maintaining regularly-established stations for purchases at Madelia, Mountain Lake, Bingham Lake, and other villages for shipment to Sioux City, Iowa, there to be manufactured and sold, did wrongfully, unlawfully, and unfairly discriminate between said localities by paying a higher price for butter fat at some stations than at others, after due allowance for transportation costs. And, more particularly, on June 11, 1923, the company purchased cream at Madelia for 38 cents per pound, and on the same day purchased cream of like quality at Mountain Lake and Bingham \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Lake for 35 cents per pound, all being intended for transportation to Sioux City, Iowa, there to be manufactured and sold. On that day the cost of transportation from Madelia to Sioux City was higher than from the other places.\n Bingham Lake, Mountain Lake (in Cottonwood county), and Madelia (in Watonwan) are villages of Southern Minnesota, about 120, 130, and 160 miles, respectively, northeast of Sioux City, and are connected therewith by a single direct railroad line.\n At the trial the accused company offered testimony to show:\n'That during the last nine years, the price paid for butter fat in the southern half of Minnesota, at the different towns, has varied in each town; that the variation has been from one cent to eight cents; that such price is exclusive of transportation charges; that such variation is the normal condition of the market in the sale of cream and butter fat, and is the result entirely of competitive conditions; that in certain localities there are many more competitors than there are in others; that the quality of cream differs in different localities; that the equipment and efficiency of creameries in the various localities differ, and that each of these things enters into the price that is paid for the butter fat in the particular locality where the sale is made, and that this variation in price, in each town, in the southern half of Minnesota, existed on the 11th day of June, 1923; and that such variation is constant, and has existed for nine years previous to that time, and that these variations in price are due entirely to the economic conditions in each locality, and to competition.'\n\n The trial court excluded this evidence as immaterial, and the Supreme Court approved. We may therefore treat the facts stated as though established and held to have no bearing on the question of guilt or the validity of the enactment. \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Defense was made on several grounds: That the venue was improperly laid in Cottonwood county; that the statute conflicted with the federal Constitution, by denying equal protection of the laws and liberty to contract; and that it unduly interfered with interstate commerce.\n The cause has been before the Supreme Court of Minnesota three times. 162 Minn. 146, 202 N. W. 714, 42 A. L. R. 548; 210 N. W. 163 (August 27, 1926); 210 N. W. 608 (October 29, 1926). Two opinions discuss the merits of the controversy; the last affirmed conviction upon the earlier ones.\n Replying to the objection that venue was improperly laid in Cottonwood county, locality of the lower price, the Supreme Court said:\n'The gist of the offense is the discrimination between different localities by paying different prices in different localities after making due allowance for the cost of transportation from the point of purchase to the point of sale or manufacture. The statute chooses to define the offense by referring to a higher price at one point than at another. It might define it by referring to the payment of a lower price at one point than another. The offending fact is that the same . ... The offending fact is that there are sales at different prices and thereby discrimination.'\n\n It next held that the statute did not deny equal protection to those engaged in buying cream for manufacture or sale, since they properly might be treated as a distinct class and subjected to peculiar regulations.\n Concerning the claim that the statute undertakes to deprive plaintiff in error or property and liberty of contract without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, the court said:\n'There have developed in the state a large number of so-called centralized creameries, which buy in different localities. We take it that the defendant is one. In addition, there are co-operative creameries and independent creameries, not usually maintaining other buying stations, \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n though some may. There is in the law nothing to prevent them doing so. We do not understand that the buying stations are commonly localized plants. (Counsel for the state say that creamery statistics for 1923 show then operating in the state 628 co-operative creameries, 127 independent or individual ones, and 48 'centralizers.') Often the buyer represents the creamery as an adjunct of his other business. Often his compensation is through a commission. He may have a place to receive the product, or it may be delivered directly to the railroad station. A centralized creamery, supplied with ample capital and facilities, has the ability and meets the temptation to destroy competition at a buying station by overbidding, absorbing the resultant losses, if any, through the profits of its general business, and, when competition is ended, to buy on a non-competitive basis. If it does all this successfully, it has a monopoly, and may or may not treat producers justly. The statute seeks to prevent the destruction of competition by forbidding overbidding, unless the dealer makes prices at other buying points correspond, after proper allowances for the cost of transportation. If the statute is obeyed, destroying competition is expensive. The statute limits the right of the creamery to contract at its buying points on a basis satisfactory to itself and its patrons. The state must concede this, and it does. ...\n\n'The dairy industry, measured in money, is a large, perhaps just now the largest, productive industry of the state. ... It is not surprising that in the marketing of so great a product, coming from so wide an area of production, under conditions such as obtain, those engaged in the industry claim abuses for which they seek legislative remedy. The exercise of the police power is not confined to measures having in view health or morals of the community. The welfare of a great industry and the people engaged in it may be guarded.' \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n To the contention that the statute unduly burdens interstate commerce, the court replied:\n\n'A statute may indirectly or incidentally affect interstate commerce, as local police measures frequently do, without offending the commerce clause. ... The defendant is a Minnesota corporation. The product which it purchased might have gone as well to a point in Minnesota for manufacture or resale. It so happened that it went to Iowa. The statute is not unconstitutional as an interference with interstate commerce.'\n\n Counsel for the state concede that the statute requires buyers to pay the same price for like commodities at all points of purchase, after proper allowances for transportation; also, that it inhibits plaintiff in error from meeting local competition by increasing the price only at that place; also, from varying purchase prices to meet normal trade conditions.\n They further admit that the state may not arbitrarily interfere with the right of one conducting a lawful business to contract at will; but they say that the federal Constitution does not guarantee absolute freedom of contract and the state may prohibit transactions not in themselves objectionable when within reason this may seem necessary in order to suppress substantial evil.\n It seems plain enough that the real evil supposed to threaten the cream business was payment of excessive prices by powerful buyers for the purpose of destroying competition. To prevent this the statute undertook to require every buyer to adhere to a uniform price fixed by a single transaction.\n As the inhibition of the statute applies irrespective of motive, we have an obvious attempt to destroy plaintiff in error's liberty to enter into normal contracts, long regarded, not only as essential to the freedom of trade and commerce, but also as beneficial to the public. Buyers in competitive markets must accommodate their bids to \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n prices offered by others, and the payment of different prices at different places is the ordinary consequent. Enforcement of the statute would amount to fixing the price at which plaintiff in error may buy, since one purchase would establish this for all points, without regard to ordinary trade conditions.\n The real question comes to this: May the state, in order to prevent some strong buyers of cream from doing things which may tend to monopoly, inhibit plaintiff in error from carrying on its business in the usual way heretofore regarded as both moral and beneficial to the public and not shown now to be accompanied by evil results as ordinary incidents? Former decisions here require a negative answer. We think the inhibition of the statute has no reasonable relation to the anticipated evil-high bidding by some with purpose to monopolize or destroy competition. Looking through form to substance, it clearly and unmistakably infringes private rights, whose exercise does not ordinarily produce evil consequences, but the reverse.\n In Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590, 594\n, 37 S. Ct. 662, 664 (61 L. Ed. 1336, L. R. A. 1917 F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973), this court said:\n'Because abuses may, and probably do, grow up in connection with this business, is adequate reason for hedging it about by proper regulations. But this is not enough to justify destruction of one's right to follow a distinctly useful calling in an upright way. Certainly there is no profession, possibly no business, which does not offer peculiar opportunities for reprehensible practices; and as to every one of them, no doubt, some can be found quite ready earnestly to maintain that its suppression would be in the public interest. Skillfully directed agitation might also bring about apparent condemnation of any one of them by the public. Happily for all, the fundamental guaranties of the Constitution cannot be freely submerged, if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced and the police power invoked.' \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n Concerning a price-fixing statute, Tyson & Bro. v. Banton et al., \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 71 L. Ed. - (Feb. 28, 1927), recently declared:\n\n'It is urged that the statutory provision under review may be upheld as an appropriate method of preventing fraud, extortion, collusive arrangements between the management and those engaged in reselling tickets, and the like. That such evils exist in some degree in connection with the theatrical business and its ally, the ticket broker, is undoubtedly true, as it unfortunately is true in respect of the same or similar evils in other kinds of business. But evils are to be suppressed or prevented by legislation which comports with the Constitution, and not by such as strikes down those essential rights of private property protected by that instrument against undue governmental interference. One vice of the contention is that the statute itself ignores the righteous distinction between guilt and innocence, since it applies wholly irrespective of the existence of fraud, collusion, or extortion (if that word can have any legal significance as applied to transactions of the kind here dealt with- Commonwealth v. O'Brien & others, 12 Cush. (Mass.) 84, 90), and fixes the resale price as well where the evils are absent as where they are present. It is not permissible to enact a law which, in effect, spreads an all-inclusive net for the feet of everybody, upon the chance that, while the innocent will surely be entangled in its meshes, some wrongdoers also may be caught.'\n\n And see Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238; Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 537\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. Booth v. Illinois, \n184 \nU.S. 425\n, 22 S. Ct. 425, much relied upon by counsel for the state, sustained the validity of an act forbidding options to sell or buy property at a future time, ultimate delivery being intended. The evident purpose was to prevent gambling contracts. The Supreme Court of Illinois pointed out that gambling was commonly incidental to dealings in futures, and held the Legislature \n\n[274 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n might properly conclude that the public interest demanded their suppression as a class in order to avert this evil. This court said:\n'A calling may not in itself be immoral, and yet the tendency of what is generally or ordinarily or often done in pursuing that calling may be towards that which is admittedly immoral or pernicious. If, looking at all the circumstances that attend, or which may ordinarily attend, the pursuit of a particular calling, the state thinks that certain admitted evils cannot be successfully reached unless that calling be actually prohibited, the courts cannot interfere, unless, looking through mere forms and at the substance of the matter, they can say that the statute enacted professedly to protect the public morals has no real or substantial relation to that object, but is a clear, unmistakable infringement of rights secured by the fundamental law.'\n\n The state also relies upon Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606\n, 23 S. Ct. 168, Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192\n, 33 S. Ct. 44, Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis, \n240 \nU.S. 342\n, 36 S. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455, and Merrick v. Halsey & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 568\n, 37 S. Ct. 227. But all those cases recognize the duty of the court to inquire into the real effect of any statute duly challenged because of interference with freedom of contract guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and to declare it invalid when without substantial relation to some evil within the power of the state to suppress and a clear infringement of private rights.\n We need not consider other points advanced by plaintiff in error.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE dissent. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIRMONT CREAMERY CO. v.

Hainer and Leonard A. Flansburg, both of Lincoln, Nob., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion by the state of Minnesota to retax the costs in this court which by the judgment herein have been awarded against it. The Fairmont Creamery Company was charged with an offense under a statute of Minnesota before a justice of the peace, and was convicted. The judgment was affirmed on appeal to the district court for the county, and this was in turn affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. State v. Fairmont Creamery Co., 168 Minn. 378, 381, 210 N. W. 163, 608. The creamery company then sued out a writ of error from this court, which on April 11, 1927, reversed the judgment, because of the unconstitutionality of the statute under which the conviction had been had. \n274 \nU.S. 1\n, 47 S. Ct. 506. The following was the judgment:\n'... On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the judgment of \n\n[275 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n the said Supreme Court, in this cause, be, and the same is hereby, reversed with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.'\n\n No application for rehearing was made during the term which ended on June 6, 1927. The mandate was issued, and filed with the Supreme Court of Minnesota in July, 1927. The motion of defendant in error now before us was filed September 30, 1927\n\n\n Our rule 30, effective July 1, 1925, provided that a petition for rehearing may be filed with the clerk, in term time or in vacation, within 40 days after judgment is entered, but not later. It is contended by the plaintiff in error that the motion to retax costs would amend the judgment after the term and must be denied, for the reason that this court has no further jurisdiction in the matter. Peck v. Sanderson, 18 How. 42; Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488, 491, 492; Schell v. Dodge, \n107 \nU.S. 629, 630\n, 2 S. Ct. 830; Phillips v. Negley, \n117 \nU.S. 665, 674\n, 6 S. Ct. 901. In answer, it is said that this limitation upon the power of the court does not include mere misprisions of the clerk or clerical errors. Bank of Kentucky v. Wistar, 3 Pet. 431; Bank of United States v. Moss, 6 How. 31, 38. In the former case, the failure to include as damages in a judgment 6 per cent. interest when required by a rule of the court was held to be a clerical error that could be corrected after the term. So it is said that the inclusion of the costs in this case was a mere misprision of the clerk, because merely added by the clerk without any special order of the court. This is inferred, because no reference to costs appears in the published opinion. It is not the proper inference. The provision as to costs appears in the judgment, the form of which was, in accordance with our practice, approved by the justice who wrote the opinion. \n\n[275 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n He acted under authority of section 3, rule 29, providing:\n'In cases of reversal of any judgment or decree by this court, costs shall be allowed to the plaintiff in error, appellant or petitioner, unless otherwise ordered by the court.'\n\n A clause in a final judgment affecting costs has been held to be substantial, and not within the court's power to change after the term. Jourolman v. East Tennessee Land Co. (C. C. A.) 85 F. 251; Staude Manufacturing Co. v. Labombarde (C. C. A.) 247 F. 879. The distinction between cases, in which provisions as to interest or costs may be changed after the term and those in which they cannot be, lies in the nature and source of the alleged error. If it is made by the clerk in following or not following a rule of court, or for some other reason, the error may be remedied; but, if the action complained of was approved by the court, it is beyond recall. Here the judgment as to costs was the action of the court. See St. Louis and San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Spiller, \n275 \nU.S. 156\n, 48 S. Ct. 96, No. 577, October term, 1926, opinion announced to-day.\n But we are not content to dispose of the motion on this ground alone, even though it be adequate, for the main question is one of much importance in the everyday practice before us, and ought to be decided now. The argument for the state is that this is a criminal case, that costs in criminal proceedings are only a creature of statute, and that this court has no power to award them against a state, unless legislation of the state has conferred it. This is the rule as to the state court in Minnesota. State v. Buckman, 95 Minn. 272, 278, 104 N. W. 240, 289. At common law the public pays no costs; in England the king does not; and the state here. it is said, stands in the place of the king. So it is insisted that, when the state is brought into this court as a defendant in error in a criminal proceeding, and the judgment of the court goes against it, costs cannot be awarded against the state, because it is a sovereign.\n That the sovereign is not to be taxed with costs in either civil or criminal cases by rule of court without a statute \n\n[275 U.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n is undoubtedly true. Chief Justice Marshall, in the case of United States v. Barker, 2 Wheat. 395, said: 'The United States never pay costs.' In Reeside v. Walker, 11 How. 272, at page 290 (13 L. Ed. 693), this court said:\n'The sovereignty of the government not only protects it against suits directly, but against judgments even for cost, when it fails in prosecutions.' The Antelope, 12 Wheat. 546, 550; United States v. McLemore, 4 How. 286, 288; United States v. Boyd, 5 How. 29, 51.\n\n See, also, Nabb v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 173; Henry v. United States, 15 Ct. Cl. 162.\n But is the state to be regarded as the sovereign here? This court is not a court created by the State of Minnesota. The case is brought by a writ of error issued under the authority of the United States by virtue of the Constitution of the United States. It is not here by the state's consent but by virtue of a law, to which it is subject. Though a sovereign, in many respects, the state when a party to litigation in this court loses some of its character as such.\n For many years, costs have been awarded by this court against states. Under the judicial article of the Constitution, the original jurisdiction of this court includes suits to which a state is a party. There have been many boundary and other cases brought here by one state against another in which costs have been awarded against one of them and often against both. Usually they have been divided, but if the case proves to be a 'litigious case,' so called, all the costs have been assessed against the defeated party. State of North Dakota v. State of Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 583\n, 44 S. Ct. 208. State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 7 How. 660, 681, shows that this has been the practice since 1849. A rule of this court as to the awarding and division of costs is, of course, not a statute, but such a rule seems to us to be within the inherent authority of the court in the orderly administration of justice as between all parties litigant, properly within its jurisdic- \n\n[275 U.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n tion, except the sovereign government. This view is supported by the history of rule No. 37 of this court in the January term of 1831, 5 Pet. 724. That shows that, against the dissent of Mr. Justice Baldwin, this court adopted a rule imposing costs against a defendant for a transcript of record in cases of reversal. The dissent was based on the ground that no costs could be imposed by this court by rule without specific authority of a statute.\n It is insisted that, while in civil cases costs may be awarded against a state as a litigant before this court, the rule does not apply in criminal cases. As the objection to taxing costs against a state has been because of its sovereign character, and that, as we have said, has no application to a state as a litigant it this court, there would seem to be no more reason for immunity in a criminal case than in a civil one. But it is pointed out that this distinction has been made by this court in the case of United States ex rel. Phillips v. Gaines, 131 U. S. Appendix, clxix. That was a writ of error from this court on a certificate of division between the judges of the United States Circuit Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. It was a mandamus case brought to command the comptroller of the state to issue his warrant to the state treasurer for the payment of a bill of costs of an indictment against Phillips, one of the relators. In 1870, Phillips had been indicted in the county of Putnam for the murder of one Ford. Phillips presented his petition to the state court, praying for the removal of the indictment into the Circuit Court of the United States by virtue of three Acts of Congress, the first of March 3, 1863, c. 81, 12 Stat. 755, 756,  5, the second, of May 11, 1866, c. 80, 14 Stat. 46,  3, and the last, of February 5, 1867, c. 27, 14 Stat. 385 (28 USCA  74, 75, 79). Their purpose was to enable any officer of the United States, military or civil, charged with a crime, against the state, for acts done under color of federal \n\n[275 U.S. 70, 76]\n\u00a0\n authority, to remove the prosecution into the Circuit Court of the United States for trial by the state prosecuting officers in that court. In 1874, the state of Tennessee, by her attorney, appeared and dismissed the case, agreeing that the costs should be adjudged against the state. The Circuit Court accordingly rendered the judgment for costs. A warrant for the payment of the costs was demanded from the state comptroller and refused. Mr. Justice Strong, in deciding the case, said:\n'Costs in criminal proceedings are a creature of statute, and a court has no power to award them unless some statute has conferred it.'\n\n He pointed out that this was the rule in the state of Tennessee, Mooneys v. State, 2 Yerg. (Tenn.) 578, but referred to an act of 1813 of that state, in which it was provided that in all criminal cases above the grade of petit larceny, where the defendant was acquitted, costs should be paid out of the treasury of the state. There were certain statutory prerequisites before they could be paid by the comptroller. The judgment of this court turned on the fact that such prerequisites had not been complied with. The language of the court indicated that costs could only be awarded in accordance with the statute of the state of Tennessee. We do not think that the case on its facts is an authority here. There was a peculiar and exceptional situation. The case was a prosecution by the state of Tennessee, and its trial by the state was bodily transferred to the environment of the Circuit Court of the United States. All incidents of a trial of the case in the state court were regarded as following the case in the federal court. The question of costs was, therefore, thought to be governed by the same rule as it would have been in the state court.\n Without reconsidering the correctness of that ruling, we think the case here to be different. The costs here incurred are in a litigation brought by writ of error into \n\n[275 U.S. 70, 77]\n\u00a0\n this court to test the validity under the federal Constitution of a statute of the state. The incidents of the hearing are those which attach to the regular jurisdiction of this court. We have had our clerk make an examination of our records reaching back to 1860. There were 129 cases examined, which do not include the boundary cases between states on the original docket already referred to. It thus appears that since that date the invariable practice has been when the judgment has been against a state in both civil and criminal cases to adjudge costs against it, under the rule which is not section 3, rule 29, of our present rules. That rule in different forms, and under a different number, has been in force since the February term, 1810. Dewhurst, Rules of Practice in the U. S. Courts ( 2d Ed.) 153. It has been in its present form since the January term, 1858. See St. Louis & San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Spiller, supra, opinion announced this day. We think that the rule construed by long practice justifies us in treating the state just as any other litigant, and in imposing costs upon it as such, without regard to the inferences sought to be drawn from United States ex rel. Phillips v. Gaines, supra.\n If specific statutory authority is needed, it is found in section 254 of the Judicial Code, which first appeared in the Act of March 3, 1877, c. 105, 19 Stat. 344, and was re-enacted March 3, 1911 (chapter 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1160 (28 USCA  352; Comp. St.  1231)). It provides that there shall be 'taxed against the losing party in each and every cause pending in the Supreme Court' the cost of printing the record, except when the judgment is against the United States. This exception of the United States in the section with its emphatic inclusion of every other litigant shows that a state as litigant must pay the costs of printing, if it loses, in every case, civil or criminal. These costs constitute a large part of all the costs. The section certainly constitutes pro tanto statutory authority to impose costs generally against a state if defeated.\n The motion is denied. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARRINGTON v. T. TOKUSHIGE(1927)\nNo. 465\nArgued: January 21, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. B. Lymer, of Honolulu, Hawaii, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph Lightfoot, of Honolulu, Hawaii, for respondents.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 284, 290]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed (11 F.(2d) 710) an interlocutory decree rendered by the United States District Court of Hawaii July 21, 1925, which granted a temporary injunction forbidding petitioners-Governor, Attorney General, and superintendent of public instruction of that territory-from attempting to enforce the provisions of Act 30, Special Session 1920, Legislature of Hawaii, entitled 'An act relating to foreign language schools and teachers thereof,' as amended by Act 171 of 1923 and Act 152 of 1925, and certain regulations adopted by the department of public instruction June 1, 1925. The interlocutory decree was granted upon the bill and affidavits presented by both sides. No answer has been filed. In these circumstances we only consider whether the judicial discretion of the trial court was improperly exercised.\n Respondents claimed below and maintain here that enforcement of the challenged act would deprive them of their liberty and property without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment. Petitioners insist that the entire act and the regulations adopted thereunder are valid; that they prescribe lawful rules for the conduct of private foreign language schools necessary for the public welfare; also that, if any provision of the statute transcends the power of the Legislature, it should be disregarded and the remaining ones should be enforced.\n If the enactment is subject to the asserted objections it is not here seriously questioned that respondents are entitled to the relief granted.\n There are 163 foreign language schools in the territory. Nine are conducted in the \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 291]\n\u00a0\n Korean language, 7 in the Chinese, and the remainder in the Japanese. Respondents are members of numerous voluntary unincorporated associations conducting foreign language schools for instruction of Japanese children. These are owned, maintained and conducted by upwards of 5,000 persons, the property used in connection therewith is worth $250,000, the enrolled pupils number 20,000, and 300 teachers are employed. These schools receive no aid from public funds. All children residing within the territory are required to attend some public or equivalent school, and practically all who go to foreign language schools also attend public or such private schools. It is affirmed by counsel for petitioners that Japanese pupils in the public and equivalent private schools increased from 1,320 in 1900 to 19,354 in 1920, and that out of a total of 65,369 pupils of all races on December 31, 1924, 30,487 were Japanese.\n The challenged enactment declares that the term 'foreign language school,' as used therein, 'shall be construed to mean any school which is conducted in any language other than the English language or Hawaiian language, except Sabbath schools.' And, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the following are its more prominent and questionable features:\n'No such school shall be conducted in the territory unless under a written permit therefor from the department of public instruction, nor unless the fee therefor shall have been paid as therein provided, and such permit shall be kept exposed in a prominent place at the school so as to be readily seen and read by visitors thereat.\n\n'The fee prescribed is one dollar per pupil on the estimated average attendance of pupils at the school during \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 292]\n\u00a0\n the period during which such school was conducted during the next preceding school year, or if such school was not conducted during any part of such preceding school year, then at the same rate at the estimated average attendance during the school year or unexpired part thereof in question, in which latter case the amount shall be adjusted to conform to the estimated average attendance during such year or part thereof.\n\n'The amount of the fee shall be estimated and determined by the department from such information as it may have, and shall be payable by any person, persons or corporation conducting or participating in conducting such school; and all officers, teachers and all members of any committee or governing board of any such school, and in case such school is conducted by or for a corporation or voluntary association or other group of persons, all members or associates of such corporation, association or group shall be deemed to be participants in conducting such school. Provision is then made for the collection of the fees by suit, but that provision is not deemed material here.\n\n'All permits must be renewed annually on the first day of September of each year and a similar fee must be paid, provided the department shall not be required to renew a permit for conducting any foreign language school, in the conducting of which there has been a violation of the terms of the act.\n\n'All fees collected by the department under the act shall be paid over to the treasurer of the territory and the moneys so paid are appropriated to the department to be expended in enforcing and carrying out its provisions. If at any time the funds at the disposal of the department from fees previously collected or from royalties, commissions or other moneys received in connection with the publication or sale of foreign language school text-books shall make it possible to fully and effectively \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 293]\n\u00a0\n carry out the provisions of the act with the permit fees payable by the schools based on a lower rate than one dollar per pupil, the department is authorized to make such a reduction in that rate as it may deem reasonable and expedient.\n\n'Every person conducting a foreign language school shall, not later than June 15, of each year, file with the department on forms prescribed or furnished by it a sworn list of all pupils in attendance at such school during the current school year, showing the name, sex, parents or guardians, place of birth and residence of each child.\n\n'No person shall teach in a foreign language school unless and until he shall have first applied to and obtained a permit so to do from the department and this shall also be construed to include persons exercising or performing administrative powers at any school. No permit to teach in a foreign language school shall be granted unless and until the department is satisfied that the applicant for the same is possessed of the ideals of democracy, knowledge of American history and institutions, and knows how to read, write, and speak the English language.\n\n'It is the declared object of the act to fully and effectively regulate the conducting of foreign language schools and the teaching of foreign languages, in order that the Americanism of the pupils may be promoted, and the department is directed to carry out the provisions of the act in accordance with its spirit and purpose.\n\n'Before issuing a permit to conduct a foreign language school or to teach in any such school the department shall require the applicant for such permit to sign a pledge that the applicant will, if granted a permit to teach in such a school, abide by and observe the terms of the act, and the regulations, and orders of the department, and will, to the best of his ability, so direct the minds and studies of pupils in such schools as will tend to make them \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 294]\n\u00a0\n good and loyal American citizens, and will not permit such students to receive instructions in any way inconsistent therewith.\n\n'No foreign language school shall be conducted in the morning before the school hours of the public schools or during the hours while the public schools are in session, nor shall any pupil attend any foreign language school for more than one hour each day, nor exceeding six hours in any one week, nor exceeding thirty-eight weeks in any school year: Provided, however, the department may, in its discretion and with the approval of the Governor, modify this provision.\n\n'The department shall have full power from time to time to prescribe by regulations the subjects and courses of study of all foreign language schools, and the entrance and attendance prerequisites or qualifications of education, age, school attainment, demonstrated mental capacity, health and otherwise, and the text-books used in any foreign language school.\n\n'Until otherwise provided by the department, the following regulations are in effect: Up to September 1, 1923, every pupil shall have first satisfactorily completed the American public school first grade, or a course equivalent thereto, before attending or being allowed to attend any foreign language school. Beginning September 1, 1923, and thereafter, every pupil shall have satisfactorily completed the American public school first and second grades, or courses equivalent thereto, before attending or being allowed to attend any foreign language school. Beginning September 1, 1923, and thereafter, for grades one, two and three, and beginning September 1, 1924, and thereafter, for grades four and above, all new text-books used in elementary foreign language schools shall be based upon the principle that the pupil's normal medium of expression is English and shall contain, as far as practicable, English equivalents for foreign words and idioms.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 284, 295]\n\u00a0\n 'The department is authorized to prepare, or cause to be prepared, or procure or arrange for procuring suitable text-books for the teaching of foreign languages in the foreign language schools and to enter into an agreement or agreements for the publishing and sale of the same.\n'All royalties, commissions and moneys received by or on behalf of the department in connection with the publication or sale of such text-books shall be paid over to the treasurer of the territory and shall be appropriated to the department to be expended for the purposes of the act.\n\n'In every foreign language school no subjects of study shall be taught, nor courses of study followed, nor entrance, nor attendance qualifications required, nor text-books used, other than as prescribed or permitted by the department. The latter regulations were only effective until superseded in whole or in part by others made by the department, and some such were thereafter made, but they are not deemed material to our present inquiry.\n\n'The department has power to appoint one or more inspectors of foreign language schools and to pay the salary and necessary expenses therefor; such inspectors and other duly authorized agents of the department shall have the right freely to visit such foreign language schools and to inspect the buildings, equipment, records and teaching thereof and the text-books used therein.\n\n'If the department shall at any time become satisfied that any holder of a permit to conduct a foreign language school or to teach therein does not possess the qualifications required by the act, or shall have violated or failed to observe any of the provisions of the act or of the regulations or orders of the department, the department may then and thereupon revoke the permit theretofore granted and the same shall thereupon be and become null and void.\n\n'Any person who shall conduct or participate in conducting a foreign language school or who shall teach in \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 296]\n\u00a0\n a foreign language school contrary to the provisions of the act, or who shall violate or participate in violating any of the provisions thereof, or any of the regulations or orders of the department, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $25, and each day's violation shall be deemed a separate offense.\n\n'The act further provides that if any section or part thereof is declared unconstitutional or invalid by the courts, the same shall not affect the validity of the act as a whole, or any part thereof which can be given effect without the part so decided to be unconstitutional or invalid.'\n\n On June 1, 1925, the department of public instruction adopted, and the Governor approved, certain regulations which undertook to limit the pupils who might attend foreign language schools to those who regularly attended some public school or approved private school, or had completed the eighth grade, or were over 14 years of age; also, to designate the text-books which foreign language schools should use in their primary grades.\n The affidavit of T. Iwanaga, in support of motion for temporary injunction, states:\n'That in the schools referred to in said bill, which are conducted for each grade for one hour for each school day, nothing contrary to American history and American institutions and principles of democracy is taught, the instruction being confined to the speaking, reading, and writing of the Japanese language. ...\n\n'That in the schools represented by plaintiffs there are about 12,400 pupils and said schools employ about 192 teachers; that said teachers are paid and said schools are maintained from voluntary contributions and from the fees of the children attending said schools; that the provi- \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 297]\n\u00a0\n sions of said Act 152 of the Session Laws of 1925 are so drastic that the parents of children will be afraid to pay tuition fees and other persons will be afraid to contribute to the funds of said schools lest they be subjected to the pains and penalties provided in said act; and that, therefore, unless immediate relief is afforded by this honorable court, the said schools will be unable to pay the teachers' salaries and the expenses of conducting said schools and the property of plaintiffs in said schools will be utterly destroyed.'\n\n An affidavit of the Attorney General describes the litigation which has arisen under the legislation concerning foreign language schools. He does not disavow purpose to enforce all provisions of the challenged act and regulations. An affidavit by the superintendent of public instruction advances the opinion that respondents could pay the prescribed fees, that compliance with the foreign language school laws would not prevent the operation of schools which conduct kindergartens, and that elimination of the kindergartens would not materially affect them. Also he says:\n'That instruction in said Japanese language schools is not and cannot be confined to the speaking, reading and writing of the Japanese language, but extends to many subjects and even in so far as it is intended to have for its object the speaking, reading and writing of said language, the teaching of that is and must be largely through the medium of stories whether of history or fiction and in other ways than the mere teaching of letters and words and sentences. ...\n\n'That, in the opinion of this affiant, the parents of children will not because of the provisions of said Act 152 be afraid to pay tuition fees nor will other persons be afraid to contribute to the funds of such schools and this affiant denies that said schools will, unless immediate relief is afforded by this honorable court, be unable to \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 298]\n\u00a0\n pay the teachers' salaries and the expenses of conducting said schools, and denies that the property of plaintiffs in said schools will be utterly or at all destroyed.'\n\n The foregoing statement is enough to show that the School Act and the measures adopted thereunder go far beyond mere regulation of privately supported schools, where children obtain instruction deemed valuable by their parents and which is not obviously in conflict with any public interest. They give affirmative direction concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, intrust their control to public officers, and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum and text-books. Enforcement of the act probably would destroy most, if not all, of them; and, certainly, it would deprive parents of fair opportunity to procure for their children instruction which they think important and we cannot say is harmful. The Japanese parent has the right to direct the education of his own child without unreasonable restrictions; the Constitution protects him as well as those who speak another tongue.\n Upon the record and the arguments presented, we cannot undertake to consider the validity of each separate provision of the act and decide whether, dissociated from the others, its enforcement would violate respondents' constitutional rights. Apparently all are parts of a deliberate plan to bring foreign language schools under a strict governmental control for which the record discloses no adequate reason. Here, the enactment has been defended as a whole. No effort has been made to discuss the validity of the several provisions. In the trial court the cause proceeded upon the theory that petitioners intended to enforce all of them.\n The general doctrine touching rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to owners, parents and children in respect of attendance upon schools has been announced \n\n[273 U.S. 284, 299]\n\u00a0\n in recent opinions. Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A. L. R. 1446; Bartels v. Iowa, \n262 \nU.S. 404\n, 43 S. Ct. 628; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S. Ct. 571, 39 A. L. R. 468. While that amendment declares that no state shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' the inhibition of the Fifth Amendment, 'No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' applies to the federal government and agencies set up by Congress for the government of the territory. Those fundamental rights of the individual which the cited cases declared were protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the states, are guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment against action by the territorial Legislature or officers.\n We, of course, appreciate the grave problems incident to the large alien population of the Hawaiian Islands. These should be given due weight whenever the validity of any governmental regulation of private schools is under consideration; but the limitations of the Constitution must not be transcended.\n It seems proper to add that when petitioners present their answer the issues may become more specific and permit the cause to be dealt with in greater detail.\n We find no abuse of the discretion lodged in the trial court. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COM'N v. PACIFIC STATES PAPER TRADE ASS'N(1927)\nNo. 71\nArgued: December 8, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Adrien F. Busick, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Warren Olney, Jr., Edward J. McCutchen, and Allan P. Matthew, all of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 52, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Federal Trade Commission made an order requiring respondents to cease and desist from certain methods of competition in interstate commerce found to be in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717 (Comp. St.  8836e). 7 Federal Trade Commission Decisions, 155. The order contains eight paragraphs, designated by letters (a) to (h), inclusive. The respondents brought (b), (c), (e), (g), and (h) under review in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The first two were set aside, paragraph (e) was modified, and the last two were allowed to stand. Pacific States Paper Trade Ass'n v. Federal Trade Com'n, 4 F.(2d) 457. This court granted certiorari (\n268 \nU.S. 684\n, 45 S. Ct. 636) on petition of the commission, which asks reversal of the decree as to paragraphs (b) and ( c). No petition has been filed by respondents.\n The facts were stipulated; and those here material are: Dealers in paper in each of the five principal jobbing centers in the states on the Pacific Coast have a local association. These centers are Seattle and Tacoma taken as one, Spokane, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 59]\n\u00a0\n And there is a general association known as the Pacific States Paper Trade Association, whose members are the paper dealers in these centers, including most, but not all, of the members of the local associations, and some who do not belong to a local association. The respondents in this case are the five local associations, the general association, and their members.\n The territory served by the members of each local association, while loosely defined, is that naturally tributary to the center where the members are located. The territory of Seattle and Tacoma is the northwestern part of Washington and Alaska; that of Spokane is eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana; that of Portland is Oregon, southerly Washington, and part of southern and western Idaho; that of San Francisco is the north half of California, a small portion of southern Oregon, and part of Nevada; and that of Los Angeles is the south half of California and part of Nevada and Arizona. A majority of the dealers in the Pacific Coast States are members of the associations, and they have 75 per cent. of the business in paper and paper products, exclusive of roll newspaper, which for the most part is not handled by them.\n Each local association distributes uniform price lists to its members to be observed in its territory within the state. The secretary of each is authorized to investigate complaints against members to determine whether they sell below the established prices, and three of the associations authorize the imposition of heavy fines on members for making such sales.\n The Spokane Association, in its list of prices established for Washington, printed 'suggested prices' for sales to purchasers in Idaho and western Montana, and there was a tacit or implied understanding that the prices suggested would be observed.\n And these association lists are habitually carried and used by the salesmen of members in quoting prices and \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n making sales outside the state. No association has any requirement that such price lists be observed outside the state; and the quoting of, or the making of sales at, lower or different prices in such territory is not deemed an infraction of rules or trade regulations by reason of which any jobber or wholesaler may complain.\n Among the prices fixed by each local association for sales by its members within the state where they are located are prices on what are called 'mill shipments.' These are sales or orders not requiring immediate delivery and capable of being filled by shipment from the place of manufacture. They include less than carload lots and also carload lots. The former are combined with other paper to make a carload, which is shipped to the wholesaler as a single consignment. At destination the delivery is taken by the wholesaler and the portion intended for the purchaser is turned over to him. The carload shipments are made on directions specifying as the point of destination the place where delivery is to be made from the wholesaler to the purchaser. In some cases the wholesaler, in other cases the purchaser, is named as consignee. When so named, the wholesaler either takes delivery and turns over the shipment to the purchaser, or indorses the bill of lading to the purchaser, who then receives the paper directly from the carrier. Where named as consignee, the purchaser takes delivery. In all cases the wholesaler orders the paper from the mill and pays for it. There is no contractual relation between the manufacturer and the purchaser from the wholesaler. These shipments are made from mills within and also from those without the state covered by the agreement fixing prices.\n The Commission in its findings substantially follows the stipulated facts, and from them it draws certain inferences or conclusions. Referring to the prices fixed by the local associations, the Commission said the habitual carrying and use of such price lists by member jobbers in \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 61]\n\u00a0\n quoting prices and making sales outside the state have a natural tendency to and do limit and lessen competition therein, and the result of such practice is fixed and uniform prices for such products within such territories. As to mill shipments, the Commission finds the facts in accordance with the stipulation, and concludes that mill shipments from points outside the state to or for purchasers within the state are in interstate commerce until delivered to the purchaser, and that the inclusion of fixed and uniform prices for such sales in the price lists of the associations eliminates price competition.\n Paragraph (b) of the Commission's order is to prevent the local associations, their officers and members, separately or in combination, from using any price list fixed by agreement between wholesalers in soliciting or selling in interstate commerce, and from making and distributing any such price list intended for use in making such sales. Paragraph (c) prohibits making or acting under agreements fixing prices on mill shipments when the paper sold is shipped from outside the state where the wholesaler is located, and the making or distributing of price lists to be used for making such sales.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the stipulated facts do not sustain the Commission's finding that the use of association prices by members outside the state where they are located has a tendency to lessen competition and to fix uniform prices in such territories. The validity of the inference or conclusion drawn by the Commission and of this part of the order depends upon the proper estimation of the facts stipulated. The language specifically relating to such use of the agreed prices if considered alone might possibly be deemed insufficient. But the Commission is not confined to so narrow a view of the case. That part of the stipulation properly may be taken with all the admitted facts and the inferences legitimately to be drawn from them.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 52, 62]\n\u00a0\n The members of the associations dominate the paper trade in question. They are organized to further common purposes. They limit competition in intrastate trade by adherence to uniform prices fixed by agreements through combination. The facts admitted show a strong purpose and much diligence to that end. And some of their activities are for like purpose and have the same effect in the field of interstate commerce. Suggested prices for Idaho and Montana were sent out with the Spokane lists. There was an understanding that such prices would be followed. Mill shipments, whether shipped from within or from without the state, are subject to the agreed prices. From the standpoint of respondents, restraint upon price competition in their interstate commerce is as desirable as in their business local to the states. In both classes of business, they are stimulated by the same motive to lessen competition. All the salesmen while in intrastate territory are required to sell at prices fixed by agreement. And, when across the state line in interstate territories, they use the agreed lists in quoting prices and making sales. It does not appear whether the prices so fixed are adhered to in interstate business. The fact that there is no established rule that the lists shall be followed in taking orders for interstate shipments or that the quoting of lower prices is an infraction for which complaint may be made is not controlling in favor of respondents. An understanding, express or tacit, that the agreed prices will be followed is enough to constitute a transgression of the law. No provision to compel adherence is necessary. It would appear difficult for these jobbers to maintain a uniform price list in the state while making sales across the line at different and competing prices. The effective combination to restrain price competition on one side of the state line is not consistent with the absence of such restraint on the other. The organized maintenance of uniform prices in business local \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 63]\n\u00a0\n to the states lends probative significance and weight to facts pointing in the direction of like restraint in the interstate territories. The use of the association prices by all the salesmen in making sales in interstate territories is not necessarily to be regarded as coincidence. There is ample ground for saying that such use results from the admitted combination. The failure of the stipulation to contain any direct statement on the subject does not require it to be found that salesmen are free to depart from the prices furnished them, or that the list used by one differs or may differ from that used by others in the same locality.\n The weight to be given to the facts and circumstances admitted as well as the inferences reasonably to be drawn from them is for the Commission. Its conclusion that the habitual use of the established list lessens competition and fixes prices in interstate territory cannot be said to be without sufficient support. Paragraph (b) does not go beyond what is justified by the findings. It is valid.\n Paragraph (c) applies only to mill shipments from one state to another. For the consummation of a transaction involving such a shipment, two contracts are made. The first is for sale and delivery by wholesaler to retailer in the same state. The seller is free to have delivery made from any source within or without the state. The price charged is that fixed by the local association. The other contract is between the wholesaler and the manufacturer in different states. There is no contractual relation between the manufacturer and retailer. By the shipment of the paper from a mill outside the state to or for the retailer, the wholesaler's part of the first contract is performed. The question is whether the sale by the wholesaler to the retailer in the same state is a part of interstate commerce where, subsequently at the instance of the seller and to perform his part of the contract, the paper is shipped from a mill in another state to or for \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 64]\n\u00a0\n the retailer. 'Commerce among the states is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of business.' Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, 280 (49 L. Ed. 518). And what is or is not interstate commerce is to be determined upon a broad consideration of the substance of the whole transaction. Dozier v. Alabama, \n218 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 30 S. Ct. 649, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 264. Such commerce is not confined to transportation, but comprehends all commercial intercourse between different states and all the component parts of that intercourse. And it includes the buying and selling of commodities for shipment from one state to another. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 106; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50, 55\n, 42 S. Ct. 244. The absence of contractual relation between the manufacturer and retailer does not matter. The sale by the wholesaler to the retailer is the initial step in the business completed by the interstate transportation and delivery of the paper. Presumably the seller has then determined whether his source of supply is a mill within or one without the state. If the contract of sale provided for shipment to the purchaser from a mill outside the state, then undoubtedly it would be an essential part of commerce among the states. Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506, 515\n, 43 S. Ct. 643. Clearly the absence of such a provision does not affect the substance of the matter when in fact such a shipment was contemplated and made. Cf. Dozier v. Alabama, supra; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 113\n, 38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., supra, 55 (42 S. Ct. 244). The election of the seller to have the shipment made from a mill outside the state makes the transaction one in commerce among the states. And on these facts the sale by jobber to retailer is a part of that commerce.\n The lower court cites and quotes from Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, \n209 \nU.S. 405\n, 28 S. Ct. 526, 14 Ann. Cas. 1031. Respondent cites Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593\n, 46 S. Ct. 367, and asserts that it is identical with the last mentioned case and with the \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 65]\n\u00a0\n one now before us. In the Ware & Leland Case, brokers at their office at Mobile, Ala., took orders from customers to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of cotton and grain and sent the orders to another office of theirs for execution on an exchange or board of trade in New York, New Orleans, or Chicago. Such contracts were for the most part closed out by sale or purchase of other contracts necessary to cover them. No actual deliveries were made except in a few instances, and then they were made outside Alabama at the place where the orders were sent for execution. Deliveries, if any, of cotton purchased for a customer were made to the brokers at the places where the exchanges are located. When the Mobile office of brokers made delivery of cotton on the sale of a future for a customer, the cotton was shipped by the customer from Alabama to the place of sale and there delivered through the brokers to the buyer. Delivery of grain on such contracts, when required, was made at Chicago. In the Moore Case, the contracts considered were between members of the exchange made for the purchase or sale of cotton for future delivery; the cotton was represented by warehouse receipts issued by a licensed warehouse in New York and was deliverable from the warehouse. The transactions on exchanges and boards of trade, which were considered in these cases, are essentially local in character. It was well understood that they might be closed out without any delivery. And, while for the most part if not wholly, the cotton and grain deliverable under these contracts originated in other states and had theretofore been transported in interstate commerce, it was not contemplated by the parties, seller or buyer, that delivery would be made while the commodity remained in such commerce. It would be a mere chance if any such transaction should be completed by delivery of the commodity while still the subject of commerce among the states. \n\n[273 U.S. 52, 66]\n\u00a0\n When regard is had to the facts and known course of business, it is quite clear that the transactions considered in these cases are essentially different from the mill shipments now before us.\n And, as the contracts between the wholesaler and the retailer constitute a part of commerce among the states, the elimination of competition as to price by the application of the uniform prices fixed by the local associations was properly forbidden by the order of the Commission. Paragraph (c) is valid.\n Respondents, notwithstanding their failure to petition for certiorari, now ask for reversal of that part of the decree which leaves in force part of paragraph (e) and paragraphs (g) and (h). This court has the same power and authority as if the case had been carried here by appeal or writ of error. A party who has not sought review by appeal or writ of error will not be heard in an appellate court to question the correctness of the decree of the lower court. This is so well settled that citation is not necessary. The respondents are not entitled as of right to have that part of the decree reviewed. Hubbard v. Tod, \n171 \nU.S. 474, 494\n, 19 S. Ct. 14; French Republic v. Saratoga Vichy Spring Co., \n191 \nU.S. 427, 440\n, 24 S. Ct. 145; Alice State Bank v. Houston Pasture Co., \n247 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 38 S. Ct. 496; Cf. Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers, \n240 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 36 S. Ct. 269. And, assuming power, we are not moved by any persuasive consideration to examine the parts of the Commission's order to which respondents object.\n That part of the decree which sets aside paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Commission's order is reversed. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v.

West Virginia, New York, Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland, in the coal, steel, and related industries, to enjoin the Federal Trade Commission from enforcing or attempting to enforce orders issued by that Commission against the complainant com- \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n panies, requiring them to furnish monthly reports of the cost of production, balance sheets and other voluminous information in detail upon a large variety of subjects relating to the business in which complainant corporations are engaged. The authority under which the Commission professed to act was expressed in the following resolution adopted by the Commission December 15, 1919:\n'Whereas, at a hearing held by the committee on appropriations of the House of Representatives on August 25, 1919, the Federal Trade Commission was requested to suggest what it might undertake to do to reduce the high cost of living; and\n\n'Whereas, the Commission recommended to the said committee that it would be desirable to obtain and publish from time to time current information with respect to 'the production, ownership, manufacture, storage, and distribution of foodstuffs, or other necessaries, and the products or by-products arising from or in connection with the preparation and manufacture thereof, together with figures of cost and wholesale and retail prices,' and particularly with respect to various basic industries, including coal and steel; and\n\n'Whereas the said committee recommended an appropriation of $150,000 for the current fiscal year for the said commission in consequence of this recommendation and the same was duly made by authority of Congress, and made available on November 4, 1919: Now, therefore, be it\n\n'Resolved, that the Federal Trade Commission, by virtue of section 6, paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Federal Trade Commission Act, proceed to the collection and publication of such information with respect to such basic industries as the said appropriation and other funds at its command will permit. And be it further\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 160, 167]\n\u00a0\n 'Resolved, that such action be started as soon as possible with respect to the coal industry and the steel industry, including in the latter closely related industries such as the iron ore, coke, and pig iron industries.'\n Purporting to proceed under this resolution, the Commission served separate notices upon the 22 appellees and many other corporations, engaged in mining, manufacturing, buying, and selling coal, coke, ore, iron and steel products, etc., which directed them to furnish monthly reports in the form prescribed showing output of every kind, itemized cost of production, sale prices, contract prices, capacity, buying orders, depreciation, general administration and selling expenses, income, general balance sheet, etc. Elaborate questionnaires, accompanying these orders, asked for answers revealing the intimate details of every department of the business, both intrastate and interstate. A summary of these printed in the margin sufficiently indicates their contents. \n1\n The concluding paragraph of the notice de- \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 168]\n\u00a0\n clared:\n'The purpose of this report is to compile in combined or consolidated form the data received from individual companies and to issue currently in such form accurate and comprehensive information regarding changes in the conditions of the industry both for the benefit of the industry and of the public.'\n\n Appellees did not comply with the inquiries in the notices but filed in the Supreme Court District of Columbia, their joint bill against the Commission and its members, wherein they set out its action, alleged that it had exceeded its powers, and asked that all defendants be restrained 'from the enforcement of said orders, and from requiring answers to said questionnaires, and from taking any proceedings whatever with reference to the enforcement of compliance with said orders and answers to said questionnaires'; also for general relief.\n Without questioning the appellees' right to seek relief by injunction, the appellants answered, admitted issuing of the orders, claimed authority therefor under sections 6 and 9, Federal Trade Commission Act (Act Sept. 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 721, 722 (Comp. St.  8836f, 8836i)), and further alleged and said:\n That the reports were required 'for all the purposes and under all the authority granted to them by law, including the purpose of gathering and compiling said information for publication and the consequent regulation of the interstate commerce of said complainants resulting from such publication of the true trade facts as to all of the business of complainants and of others en- \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 169]\n\u00a0\n gaged in commerce in those commodities, and including the purpose of making reports to Congress and of recommending additional legislation to Congress.\n'Defendants allege that all of the information to be acquired through the answers to said questionnaires is necessary and has direct relation to regulation and control of the interstate and foreign commerce of complainants and others answering said questionnaires, and is sought by the Federal Trade Commission for the purpose and in necessary aid of the regulation of said commerce.\n\n'Defendants admit that no complaint has been filed or is now pending before the commission against any of complainants for a violation of section 5 of the Trade Commission Act, but aver that the activities sought to be enjoined were instituted and are sought to be carried on under the provisions of said Trade Commission Act.\n\n'That one purpose of the requirements made in this case is the gathering of complete information, which is necessary in the proper regulation through publicity of the true facts as to the interstate business of the industry. That such purpose cannot be properly performed without the acquisition of the complete facts. That the acquisition of the complete information and facts required will effectuate such purpose, in that the dissemination of such trade information will tend to prevent undue fluctuations and panic markets based on ignorance of the true facts, or based on incomplete and partial or self-interested information, published only whenever and in so far as it may serve those self-interested who may publish it. That regulation by publicity is, and for a long time has been, recognized as one form of regulation which has been generally conceded to be fair and equitable to all concerned. That unless such regulation through public dissemination of the full and complete facts is carried out, other more drastic forms of attempted regulations without proper information may follow.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 160, 170]\n\u00a0\n 'That in addition to the regulatory effect, in and of itself, of such public dissemination of the complete facts, it is one of the purposes of these activities to gather and convey to Congress, for its information in the performance of its duties, the full and complete facts, in order that instead of legislating on incomplete or partial or prejudiced information, it may have the full facts before it. That if any regulatory effect upon intrastate commerce flows from such publicity, it is merely incidental to the general regulation of interstate commerce, as to which the power of Congress is complete.'\n The cause was heard upon motion to strike the answer from the files because it contained no adequate defense. The trial court concluded that, as the propounded questions were not limited to interstate commerce, but asked also for detailed information concerning mining, manufacture and intrastate commerce, they were beyond the Commission's authority. 'The power claimed by the Commission is vast and unpracticable. The mere fact that a corporation engaged in mining ships a portion of its product to other states does not subject its business of production or its intrastate commerce to the powers of Congress.' It accordingly held the answer insufficient, and, as defendants declined to amend, granted the injunction as prayed. The Court of Appeals affirmed this action. 52 App. D. C. 202, 285 F. 936. The cause, here by appeal, has been twice argued.\n Appellees were not charged with practicing unfair methods of competition (section 5, Act of Sept. 26, 1914 (Comp. St.  8836e)), or violating the Clayton Act, c. 323,  2, 3, 7, 8 (38 Stat. 730, 731, 732, being Comp. St.  8835b, 8835c, 8835g, 8835h). Orders under such charges can be enforced only through a Circuit Court of Appeals. Section 11, Clayton Act (Comp. St.  8835j); section 5, Federal Trade Commission Act ( Comp. St.  8836e).\n The action of the Commission here challenged must be justified, if at all, under the paragraphs of sections 6 and 9. Act of September 26, 1914, copied below, and the only \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 171]\n\u00a0\n methods prescribed for enforcing orders permitted by any of these paragraphs are specified in sections 9 and 10 (Comp. St.  8836i, 8836j). They are application to the Attorney General to institute an action for mandamus, and proceedings by him to recover the prescribed penalties.\n'Sec. 6. That the Commission shall also have power-\n\n'(a) To gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any corporation engaged in commerce, excepting banks and common carriers subject to the act to regulate commerce, and its relation to other corporations and to individuals, associations, and partnerships.\n\n'(b) To require, by general or special orders, corporations engaged in commerce, excepting banks, and common carriers subject to the act to regulate commerce, or any class of them, or any of them, respectively, to file with the Commission in such form as the commission may prescribe annual or special, or both annual and special, reports or answers in writing to specific questions, furnishing to the Commission such information as it may require as to the organization, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to other corporations, partnerships, and individuals of the respective corporations filing such reports or answers in writing. Such reports and answers shall be made under oath, or otherwise, as the Commission may prescribe, and shall be filed with the Commission within such reasonable period as the commission may prescribe, unless additional time be granted in any case by the Commission. ...\n\n'(f) To make public from time to time such portions of the information obtained by it hereunder, except trade secrets and names of customers, as it shall deem expedient in the public interest, and to make annual and special reports to the Congress and to submit therewith recom- \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 172]\n\u00a0\n mendations for additional legislation, and to provide for the publication of its reports and decisions in such form and manner as may be best adapted for public information and use.\n\n'(g) From time to time to classify corporations and to make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act.\n\n'(h) To investigate, from time to time, trade conditions in and with foreign countries where associations, combinations, or practices of manufacturers, merchants, or traders, or other conditions, may affect the foreign trade of the United States, and to report to Congress thereon, with such recommendations as it deems advisable. ...\n\n'Sec. 9. That for the purposes of this act the Commission, or its duly authorized agent or agents, shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purpose of examination, and the right to copy any documentary evidence of any corporation being investigated or proceeded against; and the Commission shall have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation. Any member of the Commission may sign subpoenas, and members and examiners of the Commission may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.\n\n'Such attendance of witnesses, and the production of such documentary evidence, may be required from any place in the United States, at any designated place of hearing. And in case of disobedience to a subpoena the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. ...\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 160, 173]\n\u00a0\n 'Upon the application of the Attorney General of the United States, at the request of the Commission, the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person or corporation to comply with the provisions of this act or any order of the Commission made in pursuance thereof. ...\n'Sec. 10. That any person who shall neglect or refuse to attend and testify, or to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce documentary evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful requirement of the Commission, shall be guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5, 000, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. ...\n\n'If any corporation required by this act to file any annual or special report shall fail so to do within the time fixed by the Commission for filing the same, and such failure shall continue for thirty days after notice of such default, the corporation shall forfeit to the United States the sum of $100 for each and every day of the continuance of such failure, which forfeiture shall be payable into the treasury of the United States, and shall be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the United States brought in the district where the corporation has its principal office or in any district in which it shall do business. It shall be the duty of the various district attorneys, under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, to prosecute for the recovery of forfeitures. The costs and expenses of such prosecution shall be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of the courts of the United States.'\n\n There was nothing which the Commission could have done to secure enforcement of the challenged orders except \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 174]\n\u00a0\n to request the Attorney General to institute proceedings for a mandamus or supply him with the necessary facts for an action to enforce the incurred forfeitures. If, exercising his discretion, he had instituted either proceeding, the defendant therein would have been fully heard, and could have adequately and effectively presented every ground of objection sought to be presented now. Consequently the trial court should have refused to entertain the bill in equity for an injunction.\n We think that the consent of the parties was not enough to justify the court in considering the fundamental question that has been twice argued before us. It was intended by Congress in providing this method of enforcing the orders of the Trade Commission to impose upon the Attorney General the duty of examining the scope and propriety of the orders, and of sifting out of the mass of inquiries issued what in his judgment was pertinent and lawful before asking the court to adjudge forfeitures for failure to give the great amount of information required or to issue a mandamus against those whom the orders affected and who refused to comply. The wide scope and variety of the questions, answers to which are asked in these orders, show the wisdom of requiring the chief law officer of the government to exercise a sound discretion in designating the inquiries to enforce which he shall feel justified in invoking the action of the court. In a case like this, the exercise of this discretion will greatly relieve the court and may save it much unnecessary labor and discussion. The purpose of Congress in this requirement is plain, and we do not think that the court below should have dispensed with such assistance. Until the Attorney General acts, the defendants cannot suffer, and, when he does act, they can promptly answer and have full opportunity to contest the legality of any prejudicial proceeding against them. That right being adequate, they were not in a position to ask relief by injunction. The bill should have been dismissed for want of equity. \n\n[274 U.S. 160, 175]\n\u00a0\n This conclusion leads to a reversal of the decree of the District Court of Appeals, and a remanding of the case to the Supreme Court of the District with direction to dismiss the bill.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:\n I think the decree below should be affirmed-the Commission went beyond any power granted by Congress.\n This appeal was taken four years ago. Nearly seven years have passed since the cause began-June 12, 1920. Able counsel have argued it twice before us, but none suggested that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the bill because there was an adequate remedy at law. Under well- settled doctrine such a defense may be waived by failure promptly to advance it. Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S. Ct. 486; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, \n229 \nU.S. 481, 484\n, 33 S. Ct. 942; American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 43 S. Ct. 149.\n In my view it is now much too late for this court first to set up and then maintain the defense of lack of jurisdiction in the trial court, and I cannot acquiesce in the disposition of the cause upon that instable ground.

John W. Davis, of New York City, and Clarence P. Moser, of Rochester, N. Y., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings up for review a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals setting aside in part an order of the Federal Trade Commission, entered after a due hearing in a proceeding instituted by it under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,1 by which the Eastman Kodak Company, the Allied Laboratories Association, Inc., and others were required to desist from acts held by the Commission to constitute unfair methods of competition in the manufacture and sale of positive cinematograph films in interstate and foreign commerce.\n These positive films are raw materials used by film laboratories in making positive prints of motion pictures that are thrown upon the screen. The Eastman Company originated the commercial manufacture of such films many years ago. In 1920 it manufactured and sold 94 per cent. of those used in the United States; but in 1921, owing to competition by importers of films manufactured in foreign countries, its sales decreased to 81 per cent. Upon an agreed statement of facts, and the inferences which it drew therefrom, the Commission found, in effect, that thereafter the Eastman Company, with the Purpose and intent of maintaining its monopoly and lessening competition in the sale of such films, acquired three laboratories used in making motion picture prints, whose combined capacity exceeded that of all the other laboratories \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 621]\n\u00a0\n east of Chicago, and announced its intention of entering upon the manufacture of such prints; that this constituted an effective threat of overpowering competitive force which compelled the members of the Allied Laboratories-an association of manufacturers of such prints-to enter into an agreement or understanding with the Eastman Company that the members of the Allied Laboratories would use American-made films only, to the exclusion of foreign-made films, so long as the Company did not compete with them in manufacturing prints, and that the Company-which continued to maintain its laboratories in readiness for operation-would not manufacture prints in competition with them so long as they used American-made films exclusively; that this agreement or understanding had the effect of lessening competition in the sale of the films in interstate and foreign commerce and sustaining the monopoly of the Company therein; and that its ownership of the three laboratories and their maintenance in condition for operation, continued to have the effect of inducing and compelling the manufacturers of prints to use only the films made by the Company.\n On these and subsidiary findings, the Commission entered an order requiring the defendants to cease and desist from combining and cooperating in restraining competition in the manufacture and sale of positive films and maintaining the monopoly of the Eastman Company in their sale in interstate and foreign commerce, by the agreement and understanding that the members of the Allied Laboratories would use American-made films exclusively, provided the Company would not operate its laboratories in competition with them, and that the Company would not operate its laboratories for the manufacture of prints in competition with them, provided they used and continued to use American-made films exclusively; and by other incidental means. And the Com- \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 622]\n\u00a0\n mission further ordered that for the purpose of preventing the maintenance of the monopoly of the Eastman Company in the manufacture and sale of positive films and restoring competitive freedom in their distribution and sale, the Company should with due diligence sell and convey its three laboratories to parties not directly connected, or indirectly interested, with it.\n On a petition by the Eastman Company and the Allied Laboratories for a review of this order, the Circuit Court of Appeals-without referring specifically to the purpose for which the Eastman Company acquired and maintained the three laboratories-held, in substance, that the reciprocal agreement or understanding between the Eastman Company and the Allied Laboratories that their members would use only American-made films in the manufacture of prints, and the Company would not operate its laboratories for the manufacture of prints, was an unfair method of competition which the Commission had authority to prevent; but that-one judge dissenting-it was not unlawful for the Eastman Company to equip itself to enter upon the business of manufacturing prints, there being nothing unfair in its going into this business, and the Commission had no authority to order the Company to divest itself of the laboratories which it had lawfully acquired. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 F.(2d) 994. A decree was accordingly entered affirming the order of the Commission in so far as it required the Eastman Company and the Allied Laboratories to desist from their agreement or understanding in reference to the use of American-made films and the operation of the Eastman Company's laboratories, but setting aside the order in so far as it required the Eastman Company to sell its laboratories, and in other incidental respects.\n This writ of certiorari was then granted on a petition by the Commission which challenged the correctness of the decree of the Court of Appeals only in respect to the \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 623]\n\u00a0\n setting aside of so much of the order as required the Eastman Company to dispose of its laboratories. \n269 \nU.S. 546\n, 46 S. Ct. 102.\n For present purposes we do not find it necessary to determine the questions whether the finding of the Commission as to the purpose for which the Eastman Company acquired the three laboratories-based in part at least upon inferences from the agreed statement of facts-was correct, and whether, in any event, it was conclusive upon the Court of Appeals; but, in the absence of any specific reference to this matter by the Court of Appeals, we shall assume the correctness of the Commission's finding, and proceed, on that assumption, to the consideration of the only other question presented in the petition for the writ of certiorari and pressed in this Court, namely, whether the Commission had authority to order the Eastman Company to sell and convey its laboratories to other parties.\n The proceeding before the Commission was instituted under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and its authority did not go beyond the provisions of that section. By these the Commission is empowered to prevent the using of 'unfair methods of competition' in interstate and foreign commerce, and, if it finds that 'any unfair method of competition' is being used, to issue an other requiring the offender 'to cease and desist from using such method of competition.' The Commission exercises only the administrative functions delegated to it by the Act, not judicial powers. National Harness, etc., Association v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 268 F. 705, 707; Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 280 F. 45, 48. It has not been delegated the authority of a court of equity. And a Circuit Court of Appeals on a petition to review its order is limited to the question whether or not it has properly exercised the administrative authority given it by the Act, and may not sustain or award relief beyond \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 624]\n\u00a0\n the authority of the Commission; such review being appellate and revisory merely, and not an exercise of original jurisdiction by the court itself.\n The question here presented is in effect ruled by Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., \n272 \nU.S. 554, 561\n, 563 S., 47 S. Ct. 175, in which the decisions in Federal Trade Commission v. Thatcher Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 615, and Swift & Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 8 F.(2d) 595, that were relied upon by the Commission in its petition for the writ of certiorari, were reversed by this Court. In that case it was held that-although the Commission, having been granted specific authority by section 11 of the Clayton Act2 to require a corporation that had acquired the stock of a competitive corporation in violation of law 'to cease and desist from such violations, and divest itself of the stock held,' might require the corporation to divest itself of such stock in a manner preventing its use for the purpose of securing the competitor's property-it could not, after the corporation by the use of such stock had acquired the property of the competitor, require it to divest itself of the property thus acquired so as to restore the prior lawful condition. As to this we said:\n'The Act has no application to ownership of a competitor's property and business obtained prior to any action by the Commission, even though this was brought about through stock unlawfully held. The purpose of the Act was to prevent continued holding of stock and the peculiar evils incident thereto. If purchase of property has produced an unlawful status a remedy is provided through the courts.'\n\n And they 'must administer whatever remedy there may be in such situation.' Distinct reference was there made (page 561 (47 S. Ct. 178)) to section 15 of the Clayton Act (Comp. St.  8835n), where express provision is made for the invocation of judicial remedies as need therefor may arise. \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 625]\n\u00a0\n So here, the Commission had no authority to require that the Company divest itself of the ownership of the laboratories which it had acquired prior to any action by the Commission. If the ownership or maintenance of these laboratories has produced any unlawful status, the remedy must be administered by the courts in appropriate proceedings therein instituted.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I am unable to agree that the Federal Trade Commission, in the performance of its duties under the Federal Trade Commission Act, lacks the power to order the divestment of physical property, or that the decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., \n272 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S. Ct. 175, forecloses our consideration of that question here. In the Thatcher and Swift Cases considered in that opinion, the stock of competing corporations had been acquired in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act (Comp. St.  8835g), which prohibits the acquisition by one corporation of the capital stock of another 'where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition.' The stock control having been followed by purchase of the physical assets of the competing corporation, the Commission, proceeding under sections 7 and 11, ordered the offending corporation to divest itself of both the stock and the physical property. In deciding that the Commission had exceeded its authority, so far as the property was concerned, the Court expressly limited its consideration to the grant of power under sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act, section 11 in terms authorizing the Commission to make an order 'requiring such person to cease and desist from such violations, and divest itself of the stock held ... contrary to the provisions of section 7. ...- \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 626]\n\u00a0\n ' The effect of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, dealing with the different subject of unfair competition, was put to one side, the Court saying:\n'This section (referring to section 5) is not presently important; the challenged orders sought to enforce obedience to  7 of the Clayton Act.' Page 557 (47 S. Ct. 177).\n\n The scope of the decision was thus stated:\n'When the Commission institutes a proceeding based upon the holding of stock contrary to section 7 of the Clayton Act, its power is limited by section 11 to an order requiring the guilty person to cease and desist from such violation, effectually to divest itself of the stock, and to make no further use of it.' Page 561 (47 S. Ct. 178).\n\n It was not held that the Commission under no circumstances could compel the sale of physical property, and there was in fact a clear intimation in the opinion that under section 7 of the Clayton Act the acquisition of the property after a complaint had been filed against the corporation for illegal stock purchases would not find the Commission powerless.\n Section 5 of the Trade Commission Act, with which we are now concerned, declares unlawful 'unfair methods of competition in commerce,' and empowers and directs the Commission to prevent the use of such methods. The Commission is directed upon finding that the method of competition under investigation is prohibited by the act, to issue its order 'requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from using such method of competition.'\n The powers thus broadly given sharply contrast with the specific enumeration of sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act. As was pointed out in the Western Meat Co. Case, the Clayton Act prohibits only the acquisition of stock and not the assets of the competing corporation, and in terms merely authorizes an order requiring the corporation 'to cease and desist from such violations, and divest itself of the stock held. ...' For that reason alone, \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 627]\n\u00a0\n the majority of the court thought that the language of these provisions was not broad enough to enable the Commission to order the corporation to divest itself of the physical assets thus acquired although their acquisition aggravated and brought to its final consummation the very evil aimed at by the statute.\n The comprehensive language of section 5 neither invites nor supports a narrow construction. It is general in terms, and in the authorized prevention of unfair methods of competition the Commission is not limited to any particular method of making its orders effective. The power does not any the less exist because the Commission framed the present order in part in affirmative terms specifying the manner in which the company should abandon the unfair method of competition it found had been practiced. Nor does the fact that the Commission is not a court of equity lessen the power conferred upon it by the statute. It is of course essentially an administrative agency. Its orders never have the effect of an injunction and are enforceable only by proceedings instituted in the appropriate Circuit Court of Appeals. Its powers are not enhanced by the circumstance that its orders and enforceable in courts having in their own right equity powers. But it is likewise true that it cannot be denied powers granted by Congress merely because its orders resemble in form familiar equitable decrees. To make its want of equity powers ground for limiting those expressly conferred by the statute is to condemn all the orders ever made by the Commission. Orders compelling the sale of stock, preventing price cutting, local price discrimination, resale price maintenance, exclusive dealing arrangements, boycotting, blacklisting, disparagement of competitor's wares, misrepresentation, misbranding, adulteration, dishonest advertising, espionage, commercial bribery, coercion, threats, intimidation, the use of 'fighting brands' or bogus independents, to mention \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 628]\n\u00a0\n only a few of the practices which the Commission has forbidden, remind of equitable relief no less than an order compelling the sale of physical property, the very acquisition and continued possession of which may be the indispensable element in a scheme of unfair competition.\n The conclusion seems to me unavoidable, therefore, that this case cannot be disposed of without determining whether the acquisition and retention of the film laboratories by the Eastman Company, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, constituted in itself or was a part of or a step in an unfair method of competition. Until that is determined we cannot say that the Commission was without power under section 5 to make any appropriate order to prevent the use of such methods.\n That ruinous competition or the threat of it when the aim is monopoly or the suppression of competition may be the dominant factor in a violation of the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.) is no longer fairly open to question. But in determining the meaning of 'unfair methods of competition' it should be borne in mind that the Trade Commission's function is to discourage certain trade tendencies before violations of the Sherman Act have occurred. The advised use of the phrase 'unfair methods of competition' for the more familiar 'unfair competition' of the common law indicates an unmistakable congressional intent to confer on the Commission the power, subject of course to the judicial review provided for in the Act, to prevent unfair trade practices not included in the prohibition of the Sherman Act and of the common law. See Henderson, Federal Trade Commission. 36. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co., \n258 \nU.S. 483\n, 42 S. Ct. 384.\n In that part of its order which now remains undisturbed, and which is not questioned here, the Commission has found and forbidden the agreement between the Eastman Company and the Association that the members of the Association should use Amercan raw film, of which \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 629]\n\u00a0\n it appears 94 per cent. of that used in the United States is produced by the Eastman Company, to the exclusion of foreign manufactured film, provided the Eastman Company would not operate its laboratories commercially to produce positive prints in competition with the members of the Association.\n The majority, not having found it necessary to consider whether the stipulated facts established unfair methods of competition because of the Commission's supposed want of power, any extended review of them here is uncalled for. But the evidence is sufficient to justify the inference drawn by the Commission that suppression of competition in the sale of foreign films, consummated by this agreement, was accomplished in part at least by the acquisition and retention of these laboratories as a constant and imminent threat to members of the Association of competition in the business field they occupy.\n Superficial examination might suggest that the respondent's course of conduct involves nothing more than the innocuous process of extending its business to include an allied trade, but the matter may not be thus lightly disposed of. We may lay aside the question whether one already possessing monopoly powers in one field, especially where as here there is no available substitute for his products may make use of his strategic position to dominate all phases of the industry from production to consumption. For here it seems fairly inferable from the stipulated facts that there was no intention of permanent expansion. The Eastman Company threatened to engage in temporary competition with the manufacturers of prints in order to attain its objective-the suppression of foreign competition in raw film. When that was attained, the laboratories were allowed to remain idle, and the assumed advantages to the public from permanent competition were lacking. I have no difficulty in concluding that this threat of temporary competition was unfair to the Eastman Company's purchasers and to its \n\n[274 U.S. 619, 630]\n\u00a0\n foreign competitors, and was an unfair method of competition within the meaning of section 5. Compare Tuttle v. Buck, 107 Minn. 145, 119 N. W. 946, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 599, 131 Am. St. Rep. 446, 16 Ann. Cas. 87; Dunshee v. Standard Oil Co., 152 Iowa, 618, 626, 627, 132 N. W. 371, 36 L. R. A.

Central West Publishing Co., Decrees and Judgments in Federal Anti-Trust Cases, 359, 360, 362; Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 \nU.S. 66, 87\n, 37 S. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322; for cases which, although not exactly in point, lend support to this view.\n It would seem that that part of the order which still stands, forbidding the agreement for the suppression of competition, is futile if the Eastman Company may retain the laboratories as a threat to compel the manufacturers of prints to do that which they could not lawfully agree to do. In my view, the decree below should be reversed and the order of the Commission upheld.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 717, c. 311; U. S.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry S. Barger, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 145, 148]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented in this case is whether the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia has under \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 149]\n\u00a0\n the Federal Trade Commission Act (38 Stat. 717 (Comp. St.  8836a-8836k)), jurisdiction to enforce, set aside, or modify orders of the Federal Trade Commission entered against persons engaged in commerce within the District of Columbia, requiring them to cease and desist from the use of unfair methods of competition within the District.\n The case as made before the Commission was that Klesner was a resident of the District, was engaged, among other things, in the manufacture and sale of window shades in the District, doing business under the name and style of 'Shade Shop.' For some years prior to respondent's entry into this business, another establishment had been engaged exclusively in the window shade business under the same name and style, and had become well and favorably known to the purchasing public by that name. The charge heard before the Commission was that the respondent, by the use of the name 'Shade Shop,' was deceiving the purchasing public into the belief that his establishment was that of a prior long- established competitor, and by this means was causing people to deal with the respondent, in the belief that they were dealing with his competitor. Klesner answered, denying the charge. Evidence was received upon the issues joined, and after argument the Commission made its report upon the facts, and issued an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from doing business in the District of Columbia under the name of 'Shade Shop.' Klesner failed and refused to obey the order, and the Commission applied to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia for a decree of enforcement. That court, without considering the merits of the case, held that it was without jurisdiction in the premises, and dismissed the Commission's petition, June 1, 1925, in an opinion reported in 56 App. D. C. 3, 6 F.(2d) 701. A petition for certiorari was granted by this court October 26, 1925 (\n269 \nU.S. 545\n, 46 S. Ct. 102) pursuant to section 240(a) of the Judi- \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n cial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229 (43 Stat. 938 (Comp. St.  1217)).\n The ground for the dismissal of this case by the Court of Appeals was that Congress, in the Trade Commission Act, had not given jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia over suits brought to enforce the order of the Commission, as it had done in respect of such suits in the proper Circuit Courts of Appeals. The pertinent parts of the Federal Trade Commission Act bearing on this question we have set out in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n The Trade Commission Act was passed by Congress to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations from using unfair methods of competition in the commerce which Congress had the constitutional right to regulate. By section 4 of the act (Comp. St.  8836d) the commerce to be reached is defined as including not only commerce between the states, and with foreign nations and between the District of Columbia and any state or territory or foreign nation, but also commerce within the District of Columbia. The statute is clear in its direction that the Commission shall \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n make orders preventing persons engaged in the District from using the forbidden methods. Therefore the Commission was authorized to make the order which was made in this case. In section 9 of the Trade Commission Act (Comp. St.  8836i), the Commission is given power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation. And this may be required from any place in the United States at any designated place of hearing, and in case of disobedience to a subpoena, the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring such attendance and testimony. Any of the District Courts of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on, may in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n subpoena issue an order requiring the presence of the person summoned and a failure to obey the order may be punished by the District Court as a contempt thereof. Upon application of the Attorney General, at the request of the Commission, the District Courts shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this Act or any order of the Commission made in pursuance thereof.\n By section 61 of the Code of Law for the District of Columbia (31 Stat. 1199), the Supreme Court of the District is given the same powers and the same jurisdiction as District Courts of the United States and is to be deemed a court of the United States, and shall exercise all the jurisdiction of one, and a special term of the court shall be a District Court of the United States. The justices of the court are vested with the power and jurisdiction of judges \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 154]\n\u00a0\n of the District Courts of the United States. Sections 62 and 84, Code of the District of Columbia 1924. It follows that the Trade Commission could use the Supreme Court of the District to enforce the procedure needed on its part to take evidence, and thus enable it to reach its conclusions, and in this could avail itself of the power of contempt of that court.\n It has been the evident intention of Congress that laws generally applicable to enforcement of what may be called federal law in the United States generally should have the same effect within the District of Columbia as elsewhere. For this purpose the courts of the District of Columbia are federal courts of the United States. Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 442\n, 43 S. Ct. 445. They are part of the federal judicial system. In Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1\n, 25 S. Ct. 569, this court held that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia was a court of the United States, and that the District of Columbia was a district within the meaning of Revised Statutes ,  1014 (Comp. St.  1674), providing for the apprehension and holding persons for trial before such court of the United States. Where the Judicial Code provides that no writ of injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings of any court of a state, with certain exceptions, the District Court of Appeals has held that the statute applied to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Hyattsville Building Assn. v. Bouic, 44 App. D. C. 408. See, also, United States v. B. & O. R. R. 26 App. D. C. 581; Arnstein v. United States, 54 App. D. C. 119, 296 F. 946, 948.\n The question, therefore, which we have to answer, is whether, when Congress gave the Commission power to make orders in the District of Columbia, with the aid of the Supreme Court of the District, in compelling the production of evidence by contempt or mandamus, it intended to leave the orders thus made, if defied, without any review or sanction by a reviewing court, though such \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 155]\n\u00a0\n review and sanction are expressly provided everywhere throughout the United States except in the District. We think this most unlikely, and therefore it is our duty, if possible in reason, to find in the Trade Commission Act ground for inference that Congress intended to refer to and treat the Court of Appeals of the District as one of Circuit Courts of Appeals referred to in the Act to review and enforce such orders.\n It is to be noted that the same question arises in the construction of the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323 (38 Stat. 730). That act applies, as this one does, to commerce in the District, as well as between states, and with foreign nations. By its second section it forbids difference in prices to purchasers in order to lessen competition. In the third section it makes it unlawful to lease or make and sell goods patented or unpatented or fix a price thereon with the condition that the lessee or purchaser shall not use the goods or wares of competitors where such a provision shall lessen competition. By section 7 (Comp. St.  8835g) corporations are forbidden to acquire stock of another to lessen competition, and by section 8 (Comp. St.  8835h) there is a restriction upon interlocking directorates in two or more competing corporations applicable to banking associations and other corporations. Section 11 ( Comp. St.  8835j) provides that authority to enforce compliance with the sections just referred to is vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission where applicable to common carriers, int he Federal Reserve Board where applicable to banks, and in the Federal Trade Commission where applicable to all the other character of commerce. The orders of these bodies are to be made upon hearings similar to those provided for in the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Circuit Courts of Appeals are to review and enforce the orders. The existence of two such acts itself enforces the inference that Congress thought that the term 'Circuit Court of Appeals' was sufficient to include the appellate court of the District of Columbia. \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 156]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia was created by an act of Congress approved February 9, 1893 (27 Stat. 434) which conferred upon it appellate jurisdiction over the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Section 7 of the act provides that any party aggrieved by any final order, judgment, or decree of the Supreme Court of the District, or of any justice thereof, may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeals thereby created, and upon such appeal shall review such order, judgment, or decree, and affirm, reverse, or modify the same as shall be just. This was a substitution of the Court of Appeals for the general term of the Supreme Court which latter court was abolished by the act. The parallelism between the Supreme Court of the District and the Court of Appeals of the District, on the one hand, and the District Courts of the United States and the Circuit Courts of Appeals, on the other, in the consideration and disposition of cases involving what among the states would be regarded as within federal jurisdiction, is complete.\n A question similar to the one we have here was presented in the case of the Steamer Coquitlam v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 346\n, 16 S. Ct. 1117. The United States in that case brought a suit in admiralty for the forfeiture of the steamer Coquitlam because of an alleged violation of the revenue laws of the United States in the District Court of Alaska, and a decree having been rendered for the United States, an appeal was prosecuted to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Under the fifteenth section of the act creating the Circuit Court of Appeals (26 Stat. 826, 830), the Circuit Courts of Appeal, in cases in which their judgments were made final by the act, were given the same appellate jurisdiction by writ of error or appeal to review the judgments, orders, and decrees of the Supreme Courts of the several territories as by the act they might have to review the judgments, orders, and \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 157]\n\u00a0\n decrees of the District Courts and Circuit Courts, and for that purpose the several territories were, by orders of the Supreme Court to be made from time to time, to be assigned to particular circuits. 26 Stat. 826, 830. Now in Alaska there was only one court, and it was called the District Court of Alaska, and it was contended that it was not a Supreme Court of the territory, and therefore was not a court from which an appeal could be prosecuted to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. By the Act of May 17, 1884 (23 Stat. 24), a civil government was provided for Alaska, to constitute a civil and judicial district, with the civil and judicial and criminal jurisdiction of District Courts of the United States, and such other jurisdiction not inconsistent with the act as might be established by law, and the general laws of Oregon, so far as the laws were applicable, were adopted. This court held that, under the statutes, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit could not review the final judgments or decrees of the Alaska court in virtue of its appellate jurisdiction over the district and circuit courts mentioned in the Act of March 3, 1921 (26 Stat. 826, 830), but that as Alaska was one of the territories of the United States and as the District Court established in Alaska was the court of last resort within the limits of the territory, it was in a very substantial sense the Supreme Court of that territory; that no reason could be suggested why a territory of the United States in which the court of last resort was called a Supreme Court should be assigned to some circuit established by Congress that did not apply with full force to the territory of Alaska, in which the court of last resort was designated as the District Court of Alaska. The court, speaking by Mr. Justice Harlan, said (page 352 (16 S. Ct. 1119)):\n'Looking at the whole scope of the act of 1891, we do not doubt that Congress contemplated that the final \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 158]\n\u00a0\n orders and decrees of the courts of last resort in the organized territories of the United States-by whatever name those courts were designated in legislative enactments-should be reviewed by the proper Circuit Court of Appeals, leaving to this court the assignment of the respective territories among the existing circuits.'\n\n We think we may use the same liberality of construction in this case. We find here a court which by acts of Congress is to be treated as a District Court of the United States, and we find here a Court of Appeals which by the terms of its creation is exercising reviewing power over all federal cases proceeding from the District Court of the United States by appeal or writ of error so that it is exercising exactly the same function as the circuit court of appeals does with respect to the district courts within their respective territorial jurisdictions in the other parts of the United States. The services of this District Court of the United States in the District of Columbia are to be availed of under the Trade Commission Act when necessary in compelling evidence by the express words of the act. We must conclude that Congress, in making its provision for the use of the Circuit Courts of Appeal in reviewing the Commission's orders, intended to include within that description the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia as the appellate tribunal to be charged with the same duty in the District. The law was to be enforced, and presumably with the same effectiveness, in the District's of Columbia as elsewhere in the United States.\n We do not think that the cases of Swift v. Hoover, \n242 \nU.S. 107\n, 37 S. Ct. 56 and of Tefft, Weller & Co. v. Munsuri, \n222 \nU.S. 114\n, 32 S. Ct. 67, should lead us in this case to a different conclusion. They related to appeals direct to this court in bankruptcy from a court in Porto Rico, and from the Supreme Court of the District respectively. With the \n\n[274 U.S. 145, 159]\n\u00a0\n heavy burden upon this court, every direct review imposed on it was naturally viewed with critical care, and when it was sought to enlarge the jurisdiction of this court by strained construction to include review of the numerous and small claims from courts of bankruptcy in such jurisdictions, it is not strange that the attempt failed. More than that, in those cases the bankruptcy proceedings were judicial proceedings with judicial judgments which could be enforced even if not reviewed. They were not left in the air, without any sanction against a defiant litigant, such as would be the result in the present case, were the view we have taken not to prevail.\n The judgment of dismissal of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n I think the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.\n If the cause involved no more than interpretation of a doubtful provision in the statute, it hardly would be worth while to record personal views. But judicial legislation is a hateful thing and I am unwilling by acquiescence to give apparent assent to the practice.\n Possibly-probably, perhaps-if attention had been seasonably called to the matter Congress would have authorized the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to enforce orders of the Trade Commission. But the words of the enactment, which we must accept as deliberately chosen, give no such power; and I think this court ought not to interject what it can only suppose the lawmakers would have inserted if they had thought long enough. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 4.

Jones, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellees brought suit in the District Court for Western Missouri to have certain assessments of benefits on their lands for the alleged pro rata share of the cost of grading Meyer boulevard in Kansas City declared null and void, and to have canceled certain tax bills issued to defray the cost of grading. Appellants are the holders of these bills, which they acquired by purchase. The jurisdiction of the District Court rested upon diversity of citizenship and the allegation in the bill that the assessments and the proceedings had in levying them violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court, after trial, gave judgment for the relief prayed (274 F. 801), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (2 F. (2d) 676).\n Since the jurisdiction of the District Court was based upon grounds in addition to the constitutional question raised by the bill, the appeal was rightly taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Judicial Code,  128 ( Comp. St.  1120). The case is properly here on appeal from that court. Judicial Code,  241, before amended (Comp. St.  1218); Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S. Ct. 236; Weiland v. Pioneer Irrigation Co., \n259 \nU.S. 498\n, 42 S. Ct. 568\n\n\n The city council of Kansas City, by ordinance adopted in 1915, authorized the present grading improvement. Meyer boulevard, as projected, is a broad highway extending westwardly from Swope Park, a large public park in Kansas City, connecting with numerous boulevards extending north into the business section of the city. The boulevard varies from 200 to 500 feet in width. Provision is made for parkways between the \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n driveways so that, of the total improved area of 31 acres, approximately 20 acres are made up of a grass parkway. The carrying out of the project involved extensive grading and relatively large expense.\n Section 3, art. VIII, of the Kansas City Charter, imposes the cost of ordinary street grading upon the owners of abutting property extending a limited distance from the street. But in view of the extraordinary character of the projected improvement of Meyer boulevard, proceedings were had under section 28 of article VIII of the City Charter. This section, printed so far as relevant in the margin,1 establishes a procedure which may be followed for levying a special tax on any lands benefited when the improvement involves an 'unusual amount of filling in or cutting or grading away ... necessitating an expense of \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n such magnitude as to impose too heavy a burden on the land situate in the benefit district as limited in section three. ...' \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n Following the prescribed procedure, the city council passed an ordinance authorizing the improvement now in question, fixing the boundaries of the benefit district which embraced the lands of appellees, and directing that the lands within the district should be assessed for the cost of the improvement in proportion to their value as determined under the charter. The ordinance directed that suit be brought by the city in the circuit court of Jackson county against the property owners in the benefit district for the purpose of validating the ordinance and the liens for the cost of the improvements. The board of public works having made its estimate of the approximate cost of the grading, suit was brought by the city in the Jackson county circuit court. Notice of the proceeding was given all owners of property within the benefit district by four weeks' publication in a designated local newspaper in accordance with the statute. Proof of service was approved by the court. The appellee Swope entered no appearance, but the appellee Brown appeared and raised by answer numerous objections to the ordinance and assessment, including those pressed here. The material parts of the answer, set forth in the margin, 2 indicate the \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n scope of this proceeding. After a hearing, the court entered its judgment declaring valid the ordinance and the proposed assessments and liens, when effectuated in accordance with the ordinance. The motion of the appellee Brown for a new trial was denied. No appeal was taken from the decree of the court which thus became final. The city then let the contracts for the improvements which have been completed. The costs have been apportioned according to the valuation of the lands made by the city assessor, and tax bills, including those held by appellants, issued against the several tracts for the proportionate part of the special benefit tax assessed.\n In this suit to cancel the tax bills so issued, appellees alleged that section 28 of article VIII of the Charter and the \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n city ordinance and all proceedings under them violated the Constitution of the United States; that the levying of the tax was an arbitrary and abusive exercise of legislative authority, in that (1) the improvement was general rather than local, (2) that the method of fixing the benefit district was arbitrary, discriminatory, and unreasonable, and (3) that the assessment according to the value of the lands benefited, regardless of their remoteness from the improvement resulted in an assessment greatly exceeding the benefits.\n Appellants at the outset argue that all the objections made to the assessments here were open, and hence decided against appellees in the proceeding in the Jackson county circuit court, and that its judgment is not open to collateral attack in this or in any other suit, since the issues which might have been litigated there are res adjudicata here.\n The proceedings in the circuit court were had upon sufficient notice to constitute due process in proceedings of this character. Lent v. Tillson, \n140 \nU.S. 316\n, 11 S. Ct. 825; cf. North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, \n268 \nU.S. 276\n, 45 S. Ct. 491. The parties to it are concluded by the judgment if the proceeding was judicial rather than legislative or administrative in character. Both courts below held that the questions here in controversy at the time of the hearing in the state court were 'moot' and even if their adjudication was authorized by the Legislature and was apecifically made by the circuit court, it would not be binding upon the parties in the federal courts.\n But, if the determination of the state court was res adjudicata according to its laws and procedure, no reason is suggested, nor are we able to perceive any, why it is not to be deemed res adjudicata here, if the proceeding in the state court was a 'case' or 'controversy' within the appellate jurisdiction of this court (Fed. Const. art. 3,  2), so that constitutional rights asserted, or which \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n might have been asserted in that proceeding, could eventually have been reviewed here.\n That this proceeding authorized by section 28 of the Kansas City Charter was judicial in character appears from an inspection of the statute and the record in the circuit court. The proposed improvement having been authorized, the benefit district established, the estimated cost ascertained, all by action of the city council or the board of public works essentially legislative in character, the jurisdiction of the state court was invoked in an adversary proceeding to determine the validity of the liens imposed or to be imposed under the ordinance. That court is a court of general jurisdiction, having plenary power to determine all questions arising under the state law or the laws and Constitution of the United States. Section 2436, Mo. Rev. Stat. 1919; Schmelzer v. Kansas City, 295 Mo. 322, 243 S. W. 946. These questions are required to be determined in a trial in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the state. The sole duty and power of the court is to pass upon questions of law and to inquire judicially into the facts so far as necessary to ascertain the applicable rules of law. See Keller v. Potomac Elec. Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 440\n, 43 S. Ct. 445. Under this procedure, the judgment to be awarded finally determines, subject to appeal, the validity of the ordinance authorizing the improvement, the limits of the benefit district, the method of apportioning benefits, and the validity of the proposed liens. That the issues thus raised and judicially determined would constitute a case or controversy if raised and determined in a suit brought by the taxpayer to enjoin further proceedings under the ordinance could not fairly be questioned. Compare Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co., supra. They cannot be deemed any the less so because, through a modified procedure, the parties are reversed and the same issues are raised and finally determined at the behest of the city. We do not think sig- \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n nificant the fact that under section 28 the city might pay, though it did not, a part of the cost of the improvement, and that the council, in authorizing the special tax, is required to deduct from the estimated cost the amount which may be paid by the city. These provisions could not restrict the authority or capacity of the court to pass upon the validity of the benefit district and the special tax actually authorized by the ordinance.\n While ordinarily a case or judicial controversy results in a judgment requiring award of process of execution to carry it into effect, such relief is not an indispensable adjunct to the exercise of the judicial function. Naturalization proceedings (Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568\n, 46 S. Ct. 425); suits to determine a matrimonial or other status; suits for instructions to a trustee or for the construction of a will (Traphagen v. Levy, 45 N. J. Eq. 448, 18 A. 322); bills of interpleader, so far as the stakeholder is concerned (Wakeman v. Kingsland, 46 N. J. Eq. 113, 18 A. 680); bills to quiet title where the plaintiff rests his claim on adverse possession (Sharon v. Tucker, \n144 \nU.S. 533\n, 12 S. Ct. 720)-are familiar examples of judicial proceedings which result in an adjudication of the rights of litigants, although execution is not necessary to carry the judgment into effect, in the sense that no damages are required to be paid or acts to be performed by the parties. Cf. Kennedy v. Babcock, 19 Misc. Rep. 87, 43 N. Y. S. 832; Cohen v. N. Y. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 50 N. Y. 610, 625, 10 Am. Rep. 522. Nor is it essential that only established and generally recognized forms of remedy should be invoked.\n'Whenever the law provides a remedy enforceable in the courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and that remedy is pursued, there arises a case within the meaning of the Constitution, whether the subject of the litigation be property or status.' Tutun v. United States, supra, 577 (46 S. Ct. 427).\n\n Thus naturalization proceedings (Tutun v. United States, supra), or a special statutory proceeding to determine judicially whether the claim made by a domestic corporation \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n against a foreign country upon which an award had been made by a United States commissioner pursuant to treaty, had been furthered by fraud, the statute authorizing distribution of the fund in accordance with the judgment (La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423\n, 20 S. Ct. 168), are cases or controversies within the meaning of the Constitution.\n Tregea v. Modesto Irrigation District, \n164 \nU.S. 179\n, 17 S. Ct. 52, is cited as authority for the proposition that the proceeding had in the Missouri court is not judicial in character. But this court in that case rested its decision on its interpretation of the California statute in question. It held in effect that the proceeding authorized was not adversary, being a proceeding by the trustee of an irrigation district against the district itself, and that it was essentially ex parte; its purpose being to secure evidence on the basis of which the court could render an advisory opinion as to the validity of a pending bond issue. These were considerations which could only lead to the conclusion reached that the proceeding was not a case or controversy of which this court could take cognizance in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\n The present statute admits of no such construction. The proceeding is in terms directed to be 'against the respective owners of land chargeable under the provisions of this section with the cost of such work,' and the specific issue to be determined by the judgment of the court is whether or not the respective tracts in the benefit district shall be charged with the lien as provided by the ordinance. The court is directed to render judgment 'either validating such ordinance, and proposed lien against the lots, ... within said benefit district or against such lots, ... as the court may find legally chargeable, ... or the court may render judgment that such ordinance or proposed lien are, in whole or in part, invalid and illegal.' The plain effect of these provisions is to \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n authorize the court to examine and determine the validity and effect of the legislative action in establishing the benefit district. The result of the proceeding is to establish judicially, as against the property owners in the district, the validity of such action and of the liens established or to be established conformably to the statute on the specific property described.\n The issues presented and the subject-matter are such that the judicial power is capable of acting upon them. There is no want of adverse parties necessary to the creation of a controversy as in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S. Ct. 250. The judgment is not merely advisory as in Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70\n, 47 S. Ct. 282, 71 L. Ed. -; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S. Ct. 122; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n, 42 S. Ct. 274; Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S. Ct. 597; Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 42 S. Ct. 261. It operates to determine judicially the legal limits of the benefit district and to define rights of the parties in lands specifically described in the pleadings. So far as it affects owners of land in the benefit district who are citizens of other states, the controversy is a 'suit' which may be removed to the federal courts. Judicial Code,  28 ( Comp. St.  1010); Road District v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry., \n257 \nU.S. 547\n, 42 S. Ct. 250.\n That the judgment is binding on the parties and their privies and hence not open to collateral attack would seem to be the only reasonable construction of the statute, if that question were for us to decide. But the Supreme Court of Missouri, since the pendency of the present suit, has held that the judgment rendered by the Jackson county circuit court in a similar proceeding is not open to collateral attack by the property owners within the benefit district, and that such property owners may not litigate in another suit, questions, including the constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment of the assessments levied, which might have been raised in the circuit court proceeding. Schmelzer v. Kansas City, supra. This decision, although subsequent to the insti- \n\n[274 U.S. 123, 135]\n\u00a0\n tution of the present suit, effected no change in the local law, upon which appellees had relied. It must be accepted as establishing the effect as res adjudicata of the proceeding had under the Missouri statute. Compare Edward Hines, Trustee, v. Martin, \n268 \nU.S. 458\n, 45 S. Ct. 543.\n Whether the proceeding be regarded as an action in rem (Christianson v. King County, \n239 \nU.S. 356, 373\n, 36 S. Ct. 114), or an action in personam, there is in the two litigations a sufficient identity of issues and of parties to conclude the parties to the present suit ( United States v. California Bridge Co., \n245 \nU.S. 337, 341\n, 38 S. Ct. 91). Viewed as an action in personam, appellants acquired their title to the tax bills by purchase from the contractor, whose right to them was derived through the exercise by the city of powers adjudicated in the circuit court proceedings to be in it and properly exercised by it. As to those powers and hence their rights originating in the exercise of them, appellants were represented by the city, and may take the benefit of the judgment in its favor. United States v. California Bridge Co., supra, 341 ( 38 S. Ct. 91).\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'When in grading or regrading any street, avenue, highway, or part thereof, a very large or unusual amount of filling in or cutting or grading away of earth or rock be necessary, necessitating an expense of such magnitude as to impose too heavy a burden on the land situate in the benefit district as limited in section three, ... the cost of grading or regrading such street, ... may be charged as a special tax on parcels of land (exclusive of improvements) benefited thereby, after deducting the portion of the whole cost, if any, which the city may pay, and in proportion to the benefits accruing to the said several parcels of land, exclusive of improvements thereon, and not exceeding the amount of said benefit, said benefits to be determined by the board of public works as hereinafter provided, and the limits within which parcels of land are benefited shall in all such specified instances be prescribed and determined by ordinance. ...\n'The public work described above shall be provided for by ordinance, and the city may provide that after the passage of the ordinance and after an approximate estimate of the cost of the work shall have been made by the board of public works, the city shall file a proceeding in the circuit court of Jackson county, Missouri, in the name of the city, against the respective owners of land chargeable under the provisions of this section with the cost of such work.

St.  9784 (Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 112; Act Feb. 10, 1868, c. 7, 15 Stat. 34). The tax having been paid under protest, a suit for its recovery, raising the legality of the assessment, is permitted by local statutes. Stat. Wis. 1923,  74.43.\n The trial court held the assessment illegal and gave judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin reversed the judgment with a direction to the court below to enter judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the complaint. 187 Wis. 290, 203 N. W. 721. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214). Marchants' National Bank v. Richmond, \n256 \nU.S. 635, 637\n, 41 S. Ct. 619; First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 347\n, 46 S. Ct. 135.\n The contention here is that the state Supreme Court erred in holding that these tax statutes are not repugnant to section 5219, Revised Statutes.\n'National banks are not merely private moneyed institutions, but agencies of the United States, created under its laws, to promote its fiscal policies; and hence the banks, their property, and their shares cannot be taxed under state authority, except as Congress consents and then only in conformity with the restrictions attached to its consent.' First National Bank v. Anderson, supra, 347 (46 S. Ct. 138); Des Moines Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 44 S. Ct. 23. Con- \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n gress, by appropriate legislation, has permitted the taxation of shares in national banks subject to certain restrictions. Section 5219 sanctions such taxation in the state where the bank is located, subject to the restriction that 'the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state.' By decisions of this court construing this language, it is established that the phrase 'other moneyed capital' does not embrace all moneyed capital not invested in bank shares, but 'only that which is employed in such way as to bring it into substantial competition with the business of national banks.' First National Bank v. Anderson, supra, 348 ( 46 S. Ct. 138). Hence the question presented by this record is whether the tax imposed upon the shares of stock of plaintiff under the Wisconsin statutes is at a greater rate than that imposed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of Wisconsin employed in substantial competition with national banks.\n\n By section 70.31 of the Wisconsin Statutes, an ad valorem tax is assessed upon all shares of banks, including national banking associations, as personal property within the assessment district in which the bank is located. Section 70.11 exempts from such taxation 'all moneys or debts due or to become due to any person and all stocks and bonds, including bonds issued by any county, town, city village, school district, or other political subdivision of this state, not otherwise specially provided for.'\n Acting under these statutes, the taxing authorities imposed the tax now in question, but made no assessment and levied no tax upon credits or intangible property other than the shares of stock in banking corporations. The state of Wisconsin imposes a tax upon incomes including incomes derived from credits. The court below assumed, and it was not questioned upon the argument here, that this tax is not to be taken as an equivalent or \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n substitute for the ad valorem tax levied upon bank shares, and no question of the possible equivalence of the two schemes of taxation is presented. From the section cited, it appears that the tax statutes of Wisconsin discriminate in favor of moneyed capital and capital investments within the state, represented by credits or intangibles, and against that invested in shares in banking corporations.\n But it is not sufficient to show this discrimination alone. The validity of the tax complained of depends upon whether or not the moneyed capital in the state thus favored is employed in such a manner as to bring it into substantial competition with the business of national banks.\n The question thus raised involves considerations both of fact and of law. To answer it, it is necessary to ascertain the nature and extent of the moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens within the state and the relation of its employment, in point of competition, to the business of plaintiff and other national banks. It is necessary also to ascertain the precise meaning to be given the statute as applied to the facts in hand in order to determine whether the particular moneyed capital and the particular competition with which we are here concerned are moneyed capital and competition within the spirit and purpose of the statute. The question is thus a mixed one of law and fact, and in dealing with it we may review the facts in order correctly to apply the law. Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 325\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A.

The opposite view expressed in Jenkins v. Neff, \n186 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 22 S. Ct. 905, must be considered discarded by the later cases. Also, as the case is brought here from a state court for review on the ground that a federal right there set up \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n was denied, this court is not concluded by a finding of the state court that the asserted right is without basis in fact. AEtna Life Ins. Co. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 45 S. Ct. 129; Southern Pac. Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 33 S. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 901.\n The evidence shows that plaintiff in the course of its business receives deposits, loans money, has a savings department, deals in exchange, buys and sells notes, government and other bonds, discounts commercial paper and acquires real estate mortgages by loan and purchase. On the trial, plaintiff called numerous witnesses, who gave testimony, uncontradicted by defendant, tending to show the nature and extent of various classes of moneyed capital in the hands of individuals in the state and the nature of its employment in competition with the business carried on by national banks. There are real estate firms engaged in lending money to individuals in the vicinity of plaintiff's banking house, the amount thus loaned amounting annually from $250,000 to $300,000. According to the testimony, the making of these loans affords the same competition to plaintiff as loans made by banks. And similar conditions obtain throughout the state. There are various individuals, copartnerships and corporations in the vicinity engaged in the business of acquiring and selling notes, bonds, mortgages and securities. Substantial capital is employed in their business. Others, having their place of business in Milwaukee and in Chicago, are engaged within the state in the business of buying and selling securities both in the vicinity of plaintiff's banking house and elsewhere, and employ capital for that purpose. Securities thus acquired and offered for sale include public utility and other forms of bonds, notes and farm mortgages. In 1921, one company alone, having its place of business in Milwaukee but doing business throughout the state, including the vicinity of plaintiff's bank, sold approximately $25,000,000 of bonds and other securities. This company is shown to be affiliated \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n with and its stock held principally by stockholders of the First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee, and to have been organized for the purpose of taking over the business of the bank in dealing in securities. Neither the capital employed in these various enterprises by individuals or corporations, so far as invested in the credits, nor the shares held by investors in such corporations are subjected to the ad valorem tax.\n Upon this evidence, the trial court found that during 1921 moneyed capital in the hands individual citizens in the vicinity of plaintiff's banking house, amounting to many hundreds of thousands of dollars, which was not assessed for taxation nor taxed, was employed in a manner which brought it into competition with the business conducted by national banks, including that of plaintiff. It also found that moneyed capital to the extent of millions of dollars held by individual citizens throughout the state, and employed in a manner which brought it into competition with such banks, was similarly exempt from this taxation.\n The state Supreme Court held that it was not concluded by these findings of mixed law and fact. Since the Wisconsin tax law is one of state-wide application, it took judicial notice of the general conditions within the state to which the law applies, and reached the conclusion that there was no capital in the hands of individual citizens which was invested or used in substantial competition with capital invested in shares of national banks.\n In so doing, it pointed out that under section 224.03, Stat. Wis. 1923, all persons, firms, and corporations doing a banking business are required to incorporate as banks and their shares are taxed in the same way and at the same rate as shares in national banks. As the basic ground for its decision, the court stated that, in consequence of these statutes, 'there are no concerns or individuals \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n within the state of Wisconsin engaged in enterprises in which the capital employed in carrying on its business is money, 'where the object of the business is the making of profit by its use as money,' except banks. All such persons, firms, and corporations are required under the laws of the state of Wisconsin to organize as banks.'\n But the Wisconsin statutes requiring those engaged in the banking business to incorporate as banks are expressly limited in their application to those engaged in 'soliciting, receiving, or accepting of money or its equivalent on deposit as a regular business.' Stat. Wis. 1923 ,  224.02. They have no application to transactions already described which formed the basis of the trial court's finding that competition existed. It is not denied, and indeed it affirmatively appears from the evidence, that there are individuals, firms, and corporations in Wisconsin, not required by its laws to be incorporated as banks, engaged in the business of loaning money on the security of notes, bonds, and mortgages, and buying and selling securities, all involving investment and reinvestment by them and their customers. Through the activities of these business concerns, large investments are made and remade in such securities. Large amounts of capital are thus employed in some of the ordinary banking activities, although these individuals and firms do not receive deposits.\n The state court did not ignore this evidence. It conceded that the local tax statutes were in fact discriminatory. But it apparently construed the decisions of this court as requiring equality in taxation only of moneyed capital invested in businesses substantially identical with the business carried on by national banks. Consequently, since that class of business must under the Wisconsin statutes be carried on in corporate form, and capital invested in it is taxed at the same rate as national bank shares, other moneyed capital, as defined in section 5219, within \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 556]\n\u00a0\n the state, it thought, was not favored. Under this view, if logically pursued, capital invested in businesses engaged in some, but not all, of the activities of national banks, as well as that employed by individuals in investment and reinvestment in securities, such as we have described, could not be considered in determining the question of competition.\n But this court has recently had occasion, in reviewing the earlier decisions dealing with this subject, to point out that the requirement of approximate equality in taxation is not limited to investment of moneyed capital in shares of state banks or to competing capital employed in private banking. The restriction applies as well where the competition exists only with respect to particular features of the business of national banks or where moneyed capital 'is employed, substantially as in the loan and investment features of banking, in making investments, by way of loan, discount or otherwise, in notes, bonds or other securities with a view to sale or repayment and reinvestment.' First National Bank v. Anderson, supra, 348 (46 S. Ct. 138). In so doing, it followed the holding in Mercantile Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 157\n, 7 S. Ct. 826, 836 (30 L. Ed. 895), that:\n'The terms of the act of Congress, therefore, include shares of stock or other interests owned by individuals in all enterprises in which the capital employed in carrying on its business is money, where the object of the business is the making of profit by its use as money. The moneyed capital thus employed is invested for that purpose in securities by way of loan, discount, or otherwise, which are from time to time, according to the rules of the business, reduced again to money and reinvested. It includes money in the hands of individuals employed in a similar way, invested in loans, or in securities for the payment of money, either as an investment of a permanent character, or temporarily with a view to sale or repayment and reinvestment. In this way the moneyed \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 557]\n\u00a0\n capital in the hands of individuals is distinguished from what is known generally as personal property. ...'\n\n The amendment to section 5219 (Act March 4, 1923, c. 267, 42 Stat. 1499 (Comp. St.  9784)), passed after the present tax was levied, provides that:\n'Bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness in the hands of individual citizens not employed or engaged in the banking or investment business and representing merely personal investments not made in competition with such business, shall not be deemed moneyed capital within the meaning of this section.' (Italics ours.)\n\n It is said that this enactment is a legislative interpretation of section 5219 as it stood prior to the amendment, that consequently a narrower interpretation must be given to this section than in earlier cases, and that, under the section before and as amended, personal investments of individuals should, under no circumstances, be deemed included in the term competing capital. But as was pointed out in First National Bank v. Anderson, supra, 350 (46 S. Ct. 139), the amendment did no more than put into express words that 'which, according to repeated decisions of this court, was implied before.' By its terms the amendment excludes from moneyed capital only those personal investments which are not in competition with the business of national banks.\n Competition may exist between other moneyed capital and capital invested in national banks, serious in character and therefore well within the purpose of section 5219, even though the competition be with some but not all phases of the business of national banks. Section 5219 is not directed merely at discriminatory taxation which favors a competing banking business. Competition in the sense intended arises not from the character of the business of those who compete but from the manner of the employment of the capital at their command. No decision of this court appears to have so qualified section 5219 as to permit discrimination in taxation in favor of moneyed capital such \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 558]\n\u00a0\n as is here contended for. To so restrict the meaning and application of section 5219 would defeat its purpose. It was intended to prevent the fostering of unequal competition with the business of national banks by the aid of discriminatory taxation in favor of capital invested by institutions or individuals engaged either in similar businesses or in particular operations or investments like those of national banks. Mercantile Bank v. New York, supra, 155 (7 S. Ct. 826). With the great increase in investments by individuals and the growth of concerns engaged in particular phases of banking shown by the evidence in this case and in State of Minnesota v. First National Bank of St. Paul, \n273 \nU.S. 561\n, 47 S. Ct. 468, 71 L. Ed. -, to-day decided, discrimination with respect to capital thus used could readily be carried to a point where the business of national banks would be seriously curtailed. Our conclusion is that section 5219 is violated wherever capital, substantial in amount when compared with the capitalization of national banks, is employed either in a business or by private investors in the same sort of transactions as those in which national banks engage and in the same locality in which they do business.\n Some of the cases dealing with the technical significance of the term competition in this field were decided before national banks were permitted to invest in mortgages as they now are. Act Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6 ,  24, 38 Stat. 251, 273; Act Sept. 7, 1916, c. 461, 39 Stat. 752, 754 ( Comp. St.  9763); Act Feb. 25, 1927, c. 191,  16 (amending section 24). And others go no further than to hold that, in the absence of allegation and proof of competition with national banking capital, it cannot be said that an offending discrimination exists. And it is not sufficient to show that untaxed capital is invested in loans and securities, without showing also that the class of investments favored is open to national banks.\n Here large amounts of capital are shown to be invested in businesses carried on throughout the state which are of the same character as some, though not all, of the business \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 559]\n\u00a0\n carried on by national banks. In two fields at least, loans and sales of credits, capital thus employed is shown to be in substantial competition with that of national banks.\n The evidence might have been directed more in detail to the precise character of the competition; but that offered was uncontradicted, and when it was shown that national banks in the state of Wisconsin having a capital and surplus in excess of $50,000,000 are engaged in the business of making loans, and that there is an extensive loan business in the state not subjected to the tax burdens of national banks, and it was testified directly that this business came into competition with the business of plaintiff and other national banks, we think that the finding of the trial court was supported by the evidence and should not have been disturbed.\n There was also, we think, sufficient evidence that private individuals as investors of surplus funds are engaged in loaning money at interest on real estate mortgages and other evidences of indebtedness such as normally enter into the business of banking and that these investments are of substantial amount. We do not conceive that in order to establish the fact of competition it is necessary to show that national banks and competing investors solicit the same customers for the same loans or investments. It is enough as stated if both engage in seeking and securing in the same locality capital investments of the class now under consideration which are substantial in amount.\n It is argued that national banks are not authorized to deal in bonds or other evidences of indebtedness and that section 5219 was not intended to protect them from discriminatory taxation in favor of moneyed capital employed in a business in which they may not engage. But it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to determine the precise limits of their powers. They are given authority, in addition to loaning money, to exercise all such 'incidental powers' as shall be necessary to carry on the busi- \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 560]\n\u00a0\n ness of banking 'by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt.' Section 5136, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9661). They are authorized, with certain limitations, to loan money on real estate mortgages. Act Dec. 23, 1913, supra; Act Sept. 7, 1916, supra; Act Feb. 25, 1927,  24. Here plaintiff is shown to have investments in real estate mortgages and to be engaged in selling them. The sale of mortgages and 'other evidence of debt' acquired by way of loan or discount with a view to reinvestment is, we think, within the recognized limits of the incidental powers of national banks. Compare First National Bank v. Anderson, supra, 348 (46 S. Ct. 135); Mercantile National Bank v. New York, supra, 156 (7 S. Ct. 826). To that extent the business of acquiring and selling such mortgages and evidences of debt, carried on by numerous individuals, firms, and corporations in Wisconsin, comes into competition with this incidental business of national banks. That the exercise of this incidental power has become of great importance in the business of national banks appears from the Report of the Comptroller of the Currency for 1924, 44 et seq., showing that approximately one-third of the investment of national banks consist of government, railroad, public service corporation, and other bonds, and 'collateral trust and other corporation notes.'\n Finally it is said that section 5219 is directed to an unfriendly discrimination or hostile attitude on the part of a state, and that here the Wisconsin legislation was not dictated by such considerations, since the challenged exemptions were merely incidental to the adoption of a state policy of substituting, so far as possible, an income for a personal property tax. But a consideration of the entire course of judicial decision on this subject can leave no doubt that state legislation and taxing measures which by their necessary operation and effect discriminate against capital invested in national bank shares in the manner described are \n\n[273 U.S. 548, 561]\n\u00a0\n intended to be forbidden. The questions here considered arising from the application of an ad valorem tax are not affected by the amendment of section 5219 by the Act of March 4, 1923, c. 267, 42 Stat. 1499, which permits in lieu of the ad valorem tax on shares of national banks either a nondiscriminatory tax on the income of national banks or on the income derived from their shares.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISKE v.

This was overruled.\n On the trial the State offered no evidence as to the doctrines advocated, suggested or taught by the Industrial Workers of the World organization other than a copy of the preamble to the constitution of that organization containing the language set forth and quoted in the information. The defendant, who testified in his own behalf, stated that he was a member of that organization and understood what it taught; that while it taught the matters set forth in this preamble it did not teach or suggest that it would obtain industrial control in any criminal way or unlawful manner, but in a peaceful manner; that he did not believe in criminal syndicalism or sabotage, and had not at any time advocated, suggested or taught the duty, necessity, propriety and expediency of crime, criminal syndicalism or sabotage, and did not know that they were advocated, taught or suggested by the organization; and that in taking the applications for membership in the organization, which contained the preamble to the constitution, he had explained the principles of the organization so far as he knew them by letting the applicants read this preamble.\n The jury was instructed that before the defendant could be convicted they must be satisfied from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Industrial Workers \n\n[274 U.S. 380, 384]\n\u00a0\n of the World was an organization that taught criminal syndicalism as defined by the Syndicalism Act.\n The defendant moved in arrest of judgment upon the ground, among others, that the evidence and the facts stated did not constitute a public offense and substantiate the charges alleged in the information. And he also moved for a new trial upon the grounds, among others, that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence and wholly unsupported by the evidence. Both of these motions were overruled.\n On the appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, among the errors assigned were, generally, that the court erred in overruling his motions to quash the information, his demurrer to the evidence-which does not appear in the record-and his motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial; and specifically, that the 'court erred in refusing to quash the information, in overruling the demurrer to the evidence, and in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment, because the information and the cause of action attempted to be proved were based upon' the Kansas Syndicalism Act, 'which, in so far as it sustains this prosecution is in violation ... of the Constitution of the United States and especially of the Fourteenth Amendment' including the due process clause thereof.\n The Supreme Court of the State, in its opinion, said:\n'The information 'does not in set phrase allege that the association known as the Industrial Workers of the World advocates, affirmatively suggests or teaches criminal syndicalism, but when read as a whole it clearly signifies this, and also that the language quoted (which the evidence shows to be taken from the preamble of the constitution of that organization) was employed to express that doctrine. ... The language quoted from the I. W. W. preamble need not-in order to sustain the judgment-be held necessarily and as a matter of law, to advocate, \n\n[274 U.S. 380, 385]\n\u00a0\n teach or even affirmatively suggest physical violence as a means of accomplishing industrial or political ends. It is open to that interpretation and is capable of use to convey that meaning. ... The jury were not required to accept the defendant's testimony as a candid and accurate statement. There was room for them to find, as their verdict shows they did, that the equivocal language of the preamble and of the defendant in explaining it to his prospects was employed to convey and did convey the sinister meaning attributed to it by the state. A final contention is that the statute ... is obnoxious to the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Statutes penalizing the advocacy of violence in bringing about governmental changes do not violate constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech.'\n\n A decision of a State court applying and enforcing a State statute of general scope against a particular transaction as to which there was a distinct and timely insistence that if so applied, the statute was void under the Federal Constitution, necessarily affirms the validity of the statute as so applied, and the judgment is, therefore, reviewable by writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214). Dahnke- Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 288\n, 42 S. Ct. 106 . The inquiry then is whether the statute is constitutional as applied and enforced in respect of the situation presented. Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, \n259 \nU.S. 503, 510\n, 42 S. Ct. 529, 28 A. L.

Northern Pacific R. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 35 S. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1; AEtna Life Ins. Co. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 45 S. Ct. 129, and cases cited.\n Here the State court held the Syndicalism Act not to be repugnant to the due process clause as applied in a case in which the information in effect charged the defendant with violation of the Act in that he had secured members in an organization which taught, advocated and affirmatively suggested the doctrines set forth in the extracts from the preamble to its constitution, and in which there was no evidence that the organization, taught, advocated or suggested any other doctrines. No substantial inference can, in our judgment, be drawn from the language of this preamble, that the organization taught, advocated or suggested the duty, necessity, propriety, or expediency of crime, criminal syndicalism, sabotage, or other unlawful acts or methods. There is no suggestion in the preamble that the industrial organization of workers as a class for the purpose of getting possession of the machinery of production and abolishing the wage system, was to be accomplished by any other than lawful methods; nothing advocating the overthrow of the existing industrial or political conditions by force, violence or unlawful means. And standing alone, as it did in this case, there was nothing which warranted the court or jury in ascribing to this language, either as an inference of law or fact, 'the sinister meaning attributed to it by the state.' In this respect the language of the preamble is essentially different from that of the manifesto involved in Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 665\n, 45 S. Ct. 625, and lacks the essential elements which brought that document under the condemnation of the law. And it is not as if the preamble were shown to have been followed by further statements or declarations indicating that it was intended to mean, and to be understood as advocating, that the ends outlined therein would be accomplished or brought about \n\n[274 U.S. 380, 387]\n\u00a0\n by violence or other related unlawful acts or methods. Compare Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357\n, 47 S. Ct. 641, and Burns v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 328\n, 47 S. Ct. 650, this day decided.\n The result is that the Syndicalism Act has been applied in this case to sustain the conviction of the defendant, without any charge or evidence that the organization in which he secured members advocated any crime, violence or other unlawful acts or methods as a means of effecting industrial or political changes or revolution. Thus applied the Act is an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State, unwarrantably infringing the liberty of the defendant in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORD v.

Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 593, 600]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a review by certiorari of the conviction of George Ford, George Harris, J. Evelyn, Charles H. Belanger, and Vincent Quartararo, of a conspiracy, contrary to section 37 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201), to violate the National Prohibition Act, title 2,  3 and 27 (41 Stat. 305, 308, 316, c. 85 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 aa, 10138 1\/2 p)), and the Tariff Act of 1922,  593(b) being 42 Stat. 858, 982, c. 356 (Comp. St .  5841h13). The trial and conviction resulted largely from the seizure of the British vessel Quadra, hovering in the high seas off the Farallon Islands, territory of the United States, 25 miles west from San Francisco. The ship, her officers, her crew, and cargo of liquor were towed into the port of San Francisco. The seizure was made under the authority of the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, proclaimed by the President May 22, 1924 (43 Stat. 1761), as a convention to aid in the prevention of the smuggling of intoxicating liquors into the United States.\n The main questions presented are, first, whether the seizure of the vessel was in accordance with the treaty; second, whether the treaty prohibits prosecution of the persons, subjects of Great Britain, on board the seized vessel brought within the jurisdiction of the United States upon the landing of such vessel, for illegal importation of liquor; third, whether the treaty authorizes prosecution of such persons not only for the substantive offense of illegal importation or attempt to import but also for conspiracy to effect it; and, fourth, whether such persons \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 601]\n\u00a0\n without the United States conspiring and co-operating to violate its laws with other persons who are within the United States, and to commit overt acts therein, can be prosecuted therefor when thereafter found in the United States.\n The petitioners and 55 others were indicted in November, 1924, for carrying on a continuous conspiracy at the bay of San Francisco in the jurisdiction of the United States, from January 1, 1924, to November of that year, the date of the indictment, to commit offenses against the laws of the United States, first, by introducing into and transporting in the United States intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act; second, by importing liquor into the United States in violation of section 593, subdivision (b) of the Tariff Act of 1922, making it a penal offense to introduce merchandise into the United States in violation of law; and, third, by violation of the terms of the treaty. It charged as overt acts the loading of 12,000 cases of liquor on the Quadra at Vancouver, British Columbia, her proceeding on September 10, 1924, to a point less than 12 miles from the Farallon Islands, a distance which could be traversed in less than an hour by the Quadra and by the motorboats, the 903-B, C-55, Marconi, California, Ocean Queen, and divers others, by which the liquor was then delivered from her and imported into the United States; that on the 29th of September, 1924, the defendants landed from the steamer Quadra a barrel containing 100 gallons of whisky, and at another time on October 11, 1924, a large variety of alcohol, gin, brandy, whisky, and vermouth; and that at another time, on October 12th, the day of the seizure, they attempted to land 89 sacks of whisky, but that two of the defendants, who were on the small craft C-55, were arrested and were prevented from carrying out their purpose. Two defendants pleaded guilty. Of 29 defendants tried, 19, including all the crew of \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 602]\n\u00a0\n the Quadra, were acquitted, and 10, including the captain and the first and second officers of the Quadra, were convicted. Of these 10, 5, including the three officers, are now before the court as petitioners. The convictions were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit. 10 F. (2d) 339.\n The validity of the indictment is attacked, first, because it charges that the conspiracy was to violate the treaty, although the treaty creates no offense against the law of the United States. This is true, but that part of the indictment is merely surplusage and may be rejected. Bailey v. United States (C. C. A.) 5 F. (2d) 437; Remus v. United States (C. C. A.) 291 F. 591; United States v. Weiss (D. C.) 293 F. 992, 995; United States v. Drawdy (D. C.) 288 F. 567, 570. The trial court took this view. But it is contended that this is to amend the indictment, and comes within the inhibition of the principle of Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S. Ct. 781. That decision condemns the striking out of words from an indictment. The action here complained of is merely a judicial holding that a useless averment is innocuous and may be ignored. Goto v. Lane, \n265 \nU.S. 393, 402\n, 44 S. Ct. 525; Salinger v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 542\n, 47 S. Ct. 173, November 23, 1926. Next it is said that the indictment is bad for duplicity. It charges a continuous conspiracy by the defendants, at the Bay of San Francisco, between January 1, 1924, and the date of finding the indictment, to import into the United States intoxicating liquor in violation of its laws. It mentions two of such laws, and, as section 37 of the Criminal Code requires, it describes several overt acts in pursuance of the conspiracy alleged. The charge is unitary in relating to one continuous conspiracy, although in proof of it different circumstances constituting it and overt acts in pursuance of it are disclosed. This does not constitute duplicity. Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 204, 210\n, 39 S. Ct. 249; Joplin Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 531, 548\n, 35 S. Ct. 291. \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 603]\n\u00a0\n The case on the evidence made by the government was as follows:\n On October 12, 1924, the United States Coast Guard cutter Shawnee, on the lookout for vessels engaged in the illicit importation into the United States of intoxicating liquor, saw the Quadra, a British steamer of Canadian register, near the Farallon Islands. As the Shawnee bore down on her to investigate, she turned and began to move off shore. The captain of the Shawnee signaled her to stop, and she complied. As the Shawnee approached her, a motorboat, C-55, was seen just after the boat had left the Quadra. The Shawnee catptain signaled the boat to stop, and, because it did not do so, fired a shot across its bow, whereupon it rounded about and came alongside. It had two men and a number of sacks of intoxicating liquor, as well as a partly filled case of beer bottles. It was made fast to the Shawnee, and the two men were placed under arrest. The Shawnee captain then sent two officers aboard the Quadra to examine her papers. Ford, her captain, one of the convicted defendants, refused to show his papers or to give any information until he had consulted counsel. The Shawnee officers then took charge of her. She was found to contain a large quantity of intoxicating liquor, and on refusal of Ford to take her by steam into San Francisco, the Shawnee towed her to that port and turned her cargo over to the United States customs officers, while her officers and crew, including Ford, were arrested.\n The testimony for the government tended to show that the Quadra, when seized, was 5.7 nautical miles from the Farallon Islands, and that the motor boat C-55 could have traversed that distance in less than an hour.\n The evidence for the government at the trial further showed there were three vessels, the Quadra, the Malahat, and the Coal Harbour, chartered by a cargo-owning cor- \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 604]\n\u00a0\n poration called the Consolidated Exporters' Corporation, Limited, of Canada, and loaded at Vancouver, British Columbia, with large cargoes of miscellaneous liquors; that the Malahat left Vancouver in May, officially destined to Buenaventura, Colombia; that the Coal Harbour left the same port in July, with a similar cargo officially destined to La Libertad, San Salvador, and the Quadra left there in September, officially destined to La Libertad. The captains of these vessels, while hovering near the Farallones, were constantly in touch with the convicted defendants Quartararo and Belanger at San Francisco, and acted to some extent under their orders and directions. Quartararo was the most active agent of the conspiracy on shore. Belanger was a director of the Canadian corporation above named. He arranged for and had sent from San Francisco to the Malahat burlap containers to be used for landing the bottled liquor, thence to be transferred to the Quadra, and also gave the orders to transfer liquor from one vessel to another, and to bring designated liquor from the vessels' cargoes to the shore. The Quadra was supplied with fuel oil from the shore, pursuant to prearrangement. None of the seagoing vessels above named proceeded to their destinations officially described in their ship's papers, but cruised up and down between the Farallones and the Golden Gate, where the exchanges of liquor and sacks were made, and where the needed oil was delivered, and from which the liquor was carried by small boats to a landing place called Oakland Creek in San Francisco. The evidence of the conspiracy, the landing of the liquor, and the complicity of the convicted defendants therein was ample and practically undenied.\n There was a preliminary motion to exclude and suppress the evidence of the ship and cargo. It was contended that the seizure was unlawful, because not within the zone of the high seas prescribed by the treaty, and the officers of the Quadra being prosecuted were protected \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 605]\n\u00a0\n against its use as evidence against them under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the federal Constitution. The motion was heard by the District Court without a jury, and was denied in an opinion reported in U. S. v. Ford, 3 F. (2d) 643. The evidence of the government showed that the Quadra was seized at a distance from the Farallon Islands of 5.7 miles, and a test made later of the speed of the motor boat C-55 caught carrying liquor from her showed that it could traverse 6.6 miles in an hour. There was a conflict as to the exact position of the Quadra at the time of the seizure. It was further objected that the speed of the motor boat was not made under the same conditions as those which existed at the time of the seizure.\n The question of the evidential weight of the test as well as of all the the circumstances was for the judgment of the trial court. As it has been affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, we see no reason to reverse it.\n It os objected that the question of the validity of the seizure should have been submitted to the jury. So far as the objection relates to the admission of evidence, it has already been settled by this court that the question is for the court and not for the jury. Steele v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 505, 511\n, 45 S. Ct. 417; Gila Valley Railroad Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 103\n, 34 S. Ct. 229; Bartlett v. Smith, 11 Mees. & W. 483; Doe dem. Jenkins v. Devies, 10 Adol . & E. (N. S.) 314; Cleave v. Jones, 7 Exch. 421, 425; 5 Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.) p. 556,  2550\n\n\n It is further objected, however, that the issue as to the place of the seizure, though submitted to and disposed of by the court in respect to the admissibility of evidence, should also have been submitted to the jury on the general issue. The Solicitor General answers, on the authority of Ker v. Illinois, \n119 \nU.S. 436\n, 7 S. Ct. 225, that an illegal seizure would not have ousted the jurisdiction of the court to try the defendants. But the Ker Case does not apply here. It related to a trial in a state court, and this court found \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 606]\n\u00a0\n that the illegal seizure of the defendant therein violated neither the federal Constitution, nor a federal law, nor a treaty of the United States, and so that the validity of their trial after alleged seizure was not a matter of federal cognizance. Here a treaty of the United States is directly involved and the question is quite different.\n But there is a reason why this assignment of error cannot prevail. The issue whether the ship was seized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence. It only affected the right of the court to hold their persons for trial. It was necessarily preliminary to that trial. The proper way of raising the issue of fact of the place of seizure was by a plea to the jurisdiction. A plea to the jurisdiction must precede that plea of not guilty. Such a plea was not filed. The effect of the failure to file it was to waive the question of the jurisdiction of the persons of defendants. Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 332\n, 31 S. Ct. 590; Albrecht v.

It was not error, therefore, to refuse to submit to the jury on the trial the issue as to the place of the seizure.\n There was a demurrer to the indictment, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States, that the court had no jurisdiction to try those who were on the Quadra because seized beyond the 3-mile limit, and that the acts charged were not within the jurisdiction of the court. The con- \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 607]\n\u00a0\n spiracy was laid at the Bay of San Francisco, which was within the jurisdiction of the court. The conspiracy charged was undoubtedly a conspiracy to violate the laws of the United States under section 37 of the Criminal Code. The court had jurisdiction to try the offense charged in the indictment and the defendants were in its jurisdiction because they were actually in its custody.\n The defendants contend that on the face of the indictment and the treaty they are made immune from trial. This requires an examination and construction of the treaty.\n The preamble of the treaty recites that the two nations being desirous of avoiding any difficulties which might arise between them in connection with the laws in force in the United States on the subject of alcoholic beverages, have decided to conclude a convention for the purpose. The first four articles are as follows:\n Article I.\n'The high contracting parties declare that it is their firm intention to uphold the principle that 3 marine miles extending from the coast- line outwards and measured from low-water mark constitute the proper limits of territorial waters.\n\n Article II.\n\n\n (1)\n His Britannic Majesty agrees that he will raise no objection to the boarding of private vessels under the British flag outside the limits of territorial waters by the authorities of the United States, its territories or possessions in order that enquiries may be addressed to those on board and an examination be made of the ship's papers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the vessel or those on board are endeavoring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States, its territories or possessions in violation of the laws there in force. \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 608]\n\u00a0\n When such enquiries and examination show a reasonable ground for suspicion, a search of the vessel may be instituted.\n\n\n (2)\n If there is reasonable cause for belief that the vessel has committed or is committing or attempting to commit an offense against the laws of the United States, its territories or possessions prohibiting the importation of alcoholic beverages, the vessel may be seized and taken into a port of the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with such laws.\n\n\n (3)\n The rights conferred by this article shall not be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the United States, its territories or possessions than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense. In cases, however, in which the liquor is intended to be conveyed to the United States, its territories or possessions by a vessel other than the one boarded and searched, it shall be the speed of such other vessel and not the speed of the vessel boarded, which shall determine the distance from the coast at which the right under this article can be exercised.\n Article III.\n No penalty or forfeiture under the laws of the United States shall be applicable or attach to alcoholic liquors or to vessels or persons by reason of the carriage of such liquors, when such liquors the listed as sea stores or cargo destined for a port foreign to the United States, its teritories or possessions on board British vessels voyaging to or from ports of the United States, or its territories or possessions or passing through the territorial waters thereof, and such carriage shall be as now provided by law with respect to the transit of such liquors through the Panama Canal, provided that such liquors shall be kept under seal continuously while the vessel on which they are carried remains within said territorial waters and that \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 609]\n\u00a0\n no part of such liquors shall at any time or place be unladen within the United States, its territories or possessions.\n Article IV.\n Any claim by a British vessel for compensation on the grounds that it has suffered loss or injury through the improper or unreasonable exercise of the rights conferred by article II of this treaty or on the ground that it has not been given the benefit of article III shall be referred for the joint consideration of two persons, one of whom shall be nominated by each of the high contracting parties.\n Effect shall be given to the recommendations contained in any such joint report. If no joint report can be agreed upon, the claim shall be referred to the Claims Commission established under the provisions of the agreement for the settlement of outstanding pecuniary claims signed at Washington the 18th August, 1910, but the claim shall not, before submission to the tribunal, require to be included in a schedule of claims confirmed in the manner therein provided.\n The other two articles relate only to duration and ratification.\n The treaty indicates a considerate purpose on the part of Great Britain to discourage her merchant ships from taking part in the illicit importation of liquor into the United States, and the further purpose of securing without objection or seizure the transportation on her vessels, through the waters and in ports of the United States, of sealed sea stores and sealed cargoes of liquor for delivery at other destinations than the United States. The counter consideration moving to the United States is the enlargement and a definite fixing of the zone of legitimate seizure of British hovering vessels seeking to defeat the laws against importation of liquor into this country from \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 610]\n\u00a0\n the sea. The treaty did not change the territorial jurisdiction of the United States to try offenses against its importation laws. That remained exactly as it was. If the ship could not have been condemned for such offenses before the treaty, it cannot be condemned now. If the persons on board could not have been convicted before the treaty, they cannot be convicted now. The treaty provides for the disposition of the vessel after seizure. It has to be taken into port for adjudication. What is to be adjudicated? The vessel. What does that include? The inference that both ship and those on board are to be subjected to prosecution on incriminating evidence is fully justified by paragraph 1 of article II in specifically permitting examination of the ship papers and inquiries to those on board to ascertain whether not only the ship, but also those on board are endeavoring to import or have imported liquor into the United States. If those on board are to be excluded, then by the same narrow construction the cargo of liquor is to escape adjudication, though it is subject to search as the persons on board are to inquiry into their guilt. It is no straining of the language of the article therefore to interpret the phrase, 'the vessel may be seized and taken into a port of the United States ... for adjudication in accordance with such laws,' as intending that not only the vessel but that all and everything on board are to be adjudicated. The seizure and the taking into port necessarily include the cargo and persons on board. They cannot be set adrift or thrown overboard. They must go with the ship; they are identified with it. Their immunity on the high seas from seizure or being taken into port came from the immunity of the vessel by reason of her British nationality. When the vessel lost this immunity, they lost it, too; and when they were brought into a port of the United States and into the jurisdiction of its District Court, they were just as much subject to its \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 611]\n\u00a0\n adjudication as the ship. If they committed an offense against the United States and its liquor importation laws, they cannot escape conviction, unless the treaty affirmatively confers on them immunity from prosecution. There certainly are no express words granting such immunity. Why should it be implied? If it was intended by the parties why should it not have been expressed?\n It is urged that the principle of interpretation, 'Expressio unius est exclusio alterius,' requires the implication from the reference to the adjudication of the vessel alone. This maxim properly applies only when in the natural association of ideas in the mind of the reader that which is expressed is so set over by way of strong contrast to that which is omitted that the contrast enforces the affirmative inference that that which is omitted must be intended to have opposite and contrary treatment. But here, as we have already pointed out, the obvious and necessary association of the seizure and the taking to port of the cargo and those on board with that of the vessel naturally carries the same association with the step of adjudication. This destroys the idea of contrast, so that the inference based on the maxim cannot here by drawn. The ship, on the one hand, and those on her and her cargo, on the other, are not, in the natural reading of the words, set over against each other. The words 'for adjudication' are arranged as incidental to the seizure and taking into port in which the persons on board and the cargo must be included. Why, then, should they be excluded from the last of the three steps described in the disposition of the vessel?\n The maxim of interpretation relied on is often helpful, but its wise application varies with the circumstances. United States. v. Barnes, \n222 \nU.S. 513, 518\n, 519 S., 32 S. Ct. 117; City of New York v. Davis ( C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 566, 575; Saunders v. Evans, 8 H. L. C. 721, 729; London Joint Stock Bank v. Mayor, 1 C. P. Div. 1, 17; Colquhoun v. Brooks, 21 Q. \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 612]\n\u00a0\n B. Div. 52, 65. Broom, Legal Maxims (7th Ed.) p. 653, says:\n'It will, however, be proper to observe, before proceeding to give instances in illustration of the maxim, 'Expressio unius est exclusio alterius,' that great caution is requisite in dealing with it for, as Lord Campbell observed in Saunders v. Evans, it is not of universal application, but depends upon the intention of the party as discoverable upon the face of the instrument or of the transaction; thus where general words are used in a written instrument, it is necessary, in the first instance, to determine whether those general words are intended to include other matters besides such as are specifically mentioned, or to be referable exclusively to them, in which latter case only can the above maxim be properly applied.'\n\n Lord Justice Lopes says of the maxim in Colquhoun v. Brooks, supra:\n'It is often a valuable servant, but a dangerous master to follow in the construction of statutes or documents. The 'exclusio' is often the result of inadvertence or accident, and the maxim ought not to be applied, when its application, having regard to the subject-matter to which it is to be applied, leads to inconsistency or injustice.'\n\n What reason could Great Britain have for a stipulation clothing with immunity either contraband liquor which should be condemned or the guilty persons aboard, when the very object of the treaty was to help the United States in its effort to protect itself against such liquor and such persons from invasion by the sea? To give immunity to the cargo and the guilty persons on board would be to clear those whose guilt should condemn the vessel and to restore to them the liquor, and thus release both for another opportunity to flout the laws of a friendly government, which it was the purpose of the \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 613]\n\u00a0\n treaty to discourage. The owner of the vessel would thus alone be subjected to penalty, and he would suffer for the primary guilt of the immunized owner of the liquor. Such implication of immunity leads to inconsistency and injustice. The palpable incongruity contended for is such that, without express words, we cannot attribute to the high contracting parties intention to bring it about.\n Nor have we been advised that Great Britain has ever suggested that under this treaty a crew of a vessel lawfully seized could not be brought into port or tried according to our laws. Diligent as the representatives of that nation have always been in guarding the rights of their people, such a construction of the treaty has not been advanced. It is said by the Solicitor General without contradiction that, following a number of seizures by the British ships on our coasts under the treaty, those on board have been indicted and tried for offenses against the laws relating to intoxicating beverages, and that the State Department records show no objection of immunity therefrom to have been claimed for them by the British government. One instance cited is in respect to the crew of the British schooner Francis E., which was seized off the coast of Alabama, and whose master and crew were arrested and indicted, and subsequently tried and convicted, for conspiracy to smuggle intoxicating liquors into the United States. Under date of June 30, 1925, pending the trial, the British Embassy communicated to the Secretary of State a complaint as follows:\n'As you are doubtless aware, the British schooner Francis E., of Nassau, was seized by a United States revenue cutter of April 24th last, and was later escorted into the port of Mobile, Alabama, where her master and crew were arrested and charged with conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Laws.\n\n'I am informed that the defendants in this case have now been incarcerated in gaol since April 28th last, and are \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 614]\n\u00a0\n still awaiting trial, and that the long delay, added to their uncertainty as to the future, is causing them considerable suffering.'\n\n The request was then made that the trial be expedited, and this was followed by a similar request in October, 1925; but there was no claim that there was any immunity from trial secured by the treaty to those who were brought in on the vessel seized.\n The case of the United States v. Rauscher, \n119 \nU.S. 407\n, 7 S. Ct. 234, is relied on to establish the immunity contended for in this case. Rauscher was convicted under an indictment in a federal court for cruel and unusual punishment of one of the crew of an American vessel of which Rauscher was an officer. He had been extradited from British territory for murder on the high seas under section 5339 of the Revised Statutes. The question was whether he could be tried in this country for another offense than that for which he was extradited, for an offense for which the treaty granted no right to extradition. The extradition treaty was that of August 9, 1842, between Great Britain and the United States (8 Stat. 576), in which each country, upon mutual requisition of the other, agreed to deliver to justice all persons who, being charged with the crime of murder, or assault, with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, should seek an asylum or should be found, within the territories of the other: Provided that this should only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged should be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offense had there been committed; and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two governments were given jurisdiction upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive or person so charged, \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 615]\n\u00a0\n that he might be brought before such judges or other magistrates, respectively, to the end that the evidence of criminality might be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it should be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate to certify the same to the proper executive authority that a warrant could issue for the surrender of such fugitive. The court held that a defendant thus extradited could not be tried for any offense other than the one for which he was extradited. The case was decided at the end of a prolonged controversy between Great Britain and the United States, through their State Departments, on the same issue presented in several cases.\n The opinion of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Miller, and his conclusions were based, first, on the ground that, according to the doctrine of publicists and writers on international law, the country receiving the offender against its laws from another country, in the absence of treaty, has no right to proceed against him for any other offense than that for which he had been delivered up; second, that the enumeration of the offenses in the treaty there involved marked such a clear line in regard to the magnitude and importance of those offenses that it was impossible to give any other interpretation to it than the exclusion of the right of extradition in others; third, the provisions of the treaty giving a party an examination before a judicial tribunal in which before he should be delivered up, the offense for which he was to be extradited must be proven to the satisfaction of the tribunal, left no doubt that the purpose of the treaty was that the person delivered up should be tried for that offense and no other; and, fourth, that the provisions of sections 5272 and 5275 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  10118, 10121) required such course in the trial of extradited persons.\n This review of the opinion in the Rauscher Case shows that it affords no support for the implication of immunity \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 616]\n\u00a0\n of the smugglers or would-be smugglers or the contraband cargo in the case before us. If it were attempted to try the defendants or to forfeit the cargo that was brought into port for smuggling of forbidden opium, a different question might possibly be presented. But here the subjecting of the defendants and the cargo by the seizure of the vessel to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States is for a conspiracy to do the smuggling of liquor, which was the ground for the vessel's seizure. This destroys any real analogy between the Rauscher Case and this. More than this, the strength of the provisions of the treaty in the Rauscher Case as detailed in the opinion to establish the sound application of the exclusio maxim of interpretation shows how weak by contrast is its application to the circumstances of this case.\n It is next objected that the convicted defendants taken from the Quadra were not triable under the indictment, because it charges an offense against them for which under the treaty neither they nor the Quadra could have been seized in the prescribed limit. It is very doubtful whether the objection was made in time and was not waived by the plea of not guilty; but we shall treat it as having been duly made. The contention of counsel on this point is that the treaty permits seizure only for the substantive offense of importing or attempting to import liquor illegally and not for a conspiracy to do so.\n These defendants were indicted under section 37 of the Criminal Code of the United States for having conspired at the Bay of San Francisco to violate the National Prohibition Act and the Tariff Act of 1922. Section 37 of the Criminal Code provides that, if two or more persons conspire to commit an offense against the United States, and one or more of such parties commit any act to effect the object of he conspiracy, each shall be punished. \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 617]\n\u00a0\n The National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305, 308, c. 85,  3 (Comp. St .  10138 1\/2 aa)), enacted October 28, 1919, provides:\n'No person shall on or after the date when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States goes into effect, manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this act, and all the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.'\n\n The Tariff Act of September 21, 1922 (42 Stat. c. 356,  593(b), being Comp. St.  5841h13), provides that, if any person fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings into the United States, or assists in doing so, any merchandise contrary to law, he shall be fined or imprisoned. The importation of liquor into the United States is contrary to law, as shown by the Prohibition Act.\n The indictment charged as overt acts that the defendants and each of them, on the 10th and 29th of September, and October 11th, by small boats from the Quadra, landed illegally in San Francisco substantial quantities of liquor, and on the 12th of October, the day of the seizure, attempted to land another lot of liquor but were defeated by the seizure.\n The preamble of the treaty recites that the two nations, being desirous of avoiding any difficulties which might arise between them in connection with the laws in force in the United States on the subject of alcoholic beverages, have decided to conclude a convention for the purpose. Paragraph (1) of article II provides for boarding, examination, and search to ascertain whether the ship or those on board were 'endeavoring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States, ... in violation of the laws there in force.' The second paragraph of article II permits the seizure on belief that 'the vessel has committed or is committing or attempting to commit \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 618]\n\u00a0\n an offense against the laws of the United States, ... prohibiting the importation of alcoholic beverages.'\n Considering the friendly purpose of both countries in making this treaty, we do not think any narrow construction should be given which would defeat it. The parties were dealing with a situation well understood by both. In effect they wished to enable the United States better to police its seaboard, by enabling it within an hour's sail from its coast, beyond its territorial jurisdiction, and on the high seas, to seize British actual or would-be smugglers of liquor and, if they were caught, to proceed criminally against them as if seized within the 3-mile limit for the same offenses in reference to liquor importation. No particular laws by title or date were referred to in the treaty, but only the purpose and effect of them. Plainly it was the purpose of the contracting parties that vessels and men who are caught under the treaty and are proven to have violated any laws of the United States, by which the importation of liquor is intended to be stopped through forfeiture or punishment, may be prosecuted after the seizure. The National Prohibition Act expressly punishes the importation of intoxicating liquor. The Tariff Act of 1922 declares it an offense to make any illegal importation and so makes it an offense to import intoxicating liquor. Section 37 of the Criminal Code makes it an offense to conspire to violate the Prohibition Act and the Tariff Act in respect to the importation of liquor, if the conspiracy is accompanied by overt acts in pursuance of it. The conspiracy act is the one most frequently used in the prosecution of liquor importations from the sea, because such smuggling usually necessitates a conspiracy in preparation for the landing. We think that any more limited construction would not satisfy the reasonable expectations of the two parties. Nothing in the words of the treaty make such an interpretation a difficult one. The penalties under each act differ from \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 619]\n\u00a0\n those under the others. The Tariff Act and the conspiracy section each imposes a maximum penalty of two years, while that of the Prohibition Act is only six months, with a lower maximum of fine.\n The differences are clearly not sufficient to affect the construction. The substantive offense of importing liquor is in law a different one from the preparatory offense of conspiring to import liquor; but where, as here, the overt acts of the conspiracy include an actual importation of liquor and an attempt, it would seem to be quite absured to hold that the conspiracy set forth does not come within the scope of the treaty. This is not a case for keeping within the technical description of a particular offense. It is not a formal extradition treaty, where it is necessary in protection of the persons to be extradited and carried from one country to another, that the crime for which they are to be tried, should be described with nicety and precision to permit the operation of the principles recognized and enforced in the Rauscher Case. Any law, the enforcement of and punishment for which will specifically prevent smuggling of liquor, should be regarded as embraced by the treaty. The British government has advanced no contrary view. In the letter from the British Embassy of June 30, 1925, already referred to, the fact that the master and crew of the British schooner Francis E., of Nassau, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Laws, was not made the basis of complaint or protest but only of a request that the trial be expedited. The error assigned upon this point cannot be sustained.\n The next objection of the defendants taken from the Quadra is that on all the evidence they were entitled to a directed verdict of not guilty. They argue that they are charged with a conspiracy illegally to import or to attempt to import liquor into the United States, when they were corporeally at all times during the alleged conspiracy out of the jurisdiction of the United States, and \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 620]\n\u00a0\n so could commit no offense against it. What they are charged with is conspiring 'at the Bay of San Francisco' with the defendants Quartararo and Belanger illegally to import liquor, and the overt acts of thus smuggling and attempting to smuggle it. The conspiracy was continuously in operation between the defendants in the United States and those on the high seas adjacent thereto, and of the four overt acts committed in pursuance thereof, three were completed and took effect within the United States, and the fourth failed of its effect only by reason of the intervention of the federal officers. In other words, the conspiring was directed to violation of the United States law within the United States, by men within and without it, and everything done was at the procuration and by the agency of each for the other in pursuance of the conspiracy and the intended illegal importation. In such a case all are guilty of the offense of conspiring to violate the United States law whether they are in or out of the country.\n In strassheim v. Daily, \n221 \nU.S. 280\n, 31 S. Ct. 558, Daily had been convicted of procuring Armstrong, a public official of Michigan, to pay bills presented to the state which Armstrong knew to be fraudulent. It was objected that during the whole period of the crime Daily was in Chicago, Ill., and could not be punished under an indictment found in Michigan for such an offense. This court denied the claim, saying ( pages 284, 285 (31 S. Ct. 560)):\n'If a jury should believe the evidence and find that Daily did the acts that led Armstrong to betray his trust, deceived the board of control, and induced by fraud the payment by the state, the usage of the civilized world would warrant Michigan in punishing him, although he never had set foot in the state until after the fraud was complete. Acts done outside a jurisdiction, but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within it, justify a state in punishing the cause of the harm as if \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 621]\n\u00a0\n he had been present at the effect, if the state should succeed in getting him within its power. Commonwealth v. Smith, 11 Allen (Mass.) 243, 256, 259; Simpson v. State, 92 Ga. 41 (17 S. E. 984, 22 L. R. A. 248, 44 Am. St. Rep. 75); American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 356 (29 S. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047); Commonwealth v. Macloon, 101 Mass. 1, 6, 18 (100 Am. Dec. 89). We may assume therefore that Daily is a criminal under the laws of Michigan.'\n\n Other cases in this court which sustain the same view are Benson v. Henkle, \n198 \nU.S. 1\n, 25 S. Ct. 569, In re Palliser, \n136 \nU.S. 257\n, 10 S. Ct. 1034, Horner v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 207\n, 12 S. Ct. 407, Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 387\n, 26 S. Ct. 688, 6 Ann. Cas. 362, and Lamar v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 60, 65\n, 66 S., 36 S. Ct. 255.\n There has been much discussion of this general principle, and its application has been varied in some courts because of certain rules of the common law with respect to principals and accessories; but in the consideration of such a case as this we are not controlled by such considerations and regard the principle as settled as in the passage quoted. It is supported by other authorities. Commonwealth v. Gillespie, 7 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 469, 478, 10 Am. Dec. 475; Rex v. Brisac and Scott, 4 East, 164; State v. Piver, 74 Wash. 96, 132 P. 858, 49 L. R. A. (N. S.) 941, Ann. Cas. 1915 A, 695; Weil v. Black, 76 W. Va. 685, 694, 86 S. E. 666.\n In Regina V. Garrett, Dearsly's Crown Cases Reserved, 232, 241, Lord Campbell said:\n'I do not proceed upon the ground that the offense was committed beyond the jurisdiction of the court'-which was the fact there-'for, if a man employ a conscious or unconscious agent in this country, he may be amenable to the laws of England, although at the time be was living beyond the jurisdiction.'\n\n It will be found among the earlier cases that the principle is sometimes qualified by saying that the person out of the state cannot be held for a crime committed within the state by his procuration, unless it is done by an innocent agent or a mechanical one; but the weight of authority is now against such limitation. Generally the \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 622]\n\u00a0\n cases show that jurisdiction exists to try one who is a conspirator, whenever the conspiracy is in whole or in part carried on in the country whose laws are conspired against. In Hyde v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 347\n, 32 S. Ct. 793, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 614, and Brown v. Elliott, \n225 \nU.S. 392\n, 32 S. Ct. 812, the question was whether a conspiracy could be tried not where it was carried on, but in a place where only an overt act under it was performed by one conspirator. There was strong diversity of opinion among the justices, though a majority sustained the venue following the Court of King's Bench in Rex v. Brisac and Scott, 4 East, 164. But we have no such ground for difference here, for the conspiracy was being carried on all the time by communications exchanged between the conspirators in San Francisco and on the high seas just beyond the 3-mile limit near San Francisco Bay, and the overt acts were in both places.\n The whole question was fully considered from the international standpoint in a learned opinion by John Bassett Moore, now Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice, while he was Assistant Secretary in the State Department, to be found in Moore's International Law Digest, vol. 2, p. 244. The report was made in view of controversy between this government and the government of Mexico in reference to the arrest and imprisonment of one Cutting for libel charged to have been committed by Cutting in the publication of an article in a newspaper in the state of Texas. The prosecution was under article 186 of the Mexican Penal Code. That Code provided that penal offenses committed in a foreign country against a Mexican might be punished in Mexico. Our government maintained that it could not recognize the validity of a prosecution in Mexico of an American citizen, who happened thereafter to be there, for an offense committed in the United States, merely because it was committed against a Mexican. In the course of the examina- \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 623]\n\u00a0\n tion of this question, Mr. Moore, recognizing the principle already stated, said:\n'The principle that a man, who outside of a country willfully puts in motion a force to take effect in it, is answerable at the place where the evil is done, is recognized in the criminal jurisprudence of all countries. And the methods which modern invention has furnished for the performance of criminal acts in that manner has made this principle one of constantly growing importance and of increasing frequency of application.\n\n'Its logical soundness and necessity received early recognition in the common law. Thus it was held that a man who erected a nuisance in one county which took effect in another was criminally liable in the county in which the injury was done. Bulwer's Case, 7 Coke, 2 b, 3 b.; Com. Dig. Action, N, 3, 11. So, if a man, being in one place, circulates a libel in another, he is answerable at the latter place. Seven Bishops' Case, 12 State Trials, page 331; Rex v. Johnson, 7 East, 65.'\n\n After referring to the doctrine of innocent agent and its dependence on the distinctions between accessories and principal in crime, Judge Moore says (page 249):\n'But, as has been shown, the doctrine of accessoryship has been abolished by statute in many jurisdictions in which it formerly prevailed, and is condemned by many writers as unnecessary and unsound. Referring to accessories before the fact, Mr. Bishop says:\n\n\"The distinction between such accessory and a principal rests solely in authority, being without foundation either in natural reason or in the ordinary doctrines of the law. The general rule of the law is, that what one does through another's agency is to be regarded as done by himself.'\n\n'And on this point he cites Broom's Legal Maxims (2d Ed.) p. 643; Co. Lit. 258a; and the opinion of Hosmer, C. J., in Barkhamsted v. Parsons, 3 Conn. 1, that 'the \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 624]\n\u00a0\n principal of common law, 'Qui facit per alium, facit per se,' is of universal application, both in criminal and civil cases.\"\n\n The overt acts charged in the conspiracy to justify indictment under section 37 of the Criminal Code were acts within the jurisdiction of the United States, and the conspiracy charged, although some of the conspirators were corporally on the high seas, had for its object crime in the United States, and was carried on partly in and partly out of this country, and so was within its jurisdiction under the principles above settled.\n We have thus disposed of the chief objections. There are some objections on the admission of evidence, one with respect to the receipt of a telegram charged by the government to be from Belanger, a defendant, sent to Dorgan, his codirector of the Canadian corporation which owned the cargoes of liquor; another objection based on the receipt in evidence of 83 dollar bills cut in two with liquor orders written on them, associated in the evidence with Quartararo, and charged to show that he had used them for the purpose of sending them out to the officers of the rum runners to identify his agents for the safe delivery of the liquor. Another was as to the evidence of a witness, who pleaded guilty and who was permitted to testify that, at the instance of Quartararo, shown by the evidence to be the chief operator in the conspiracy, he brought into San Francisco liquor in small boats, not only from the Quadra, the Coal Harbour, and the Malahat, controlled by the Canadian corporation, but many times during the period of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment also from a vessel called the Norburn, without the direct evidence that the Norburn was controlled by the same Canadian corporation, and therefore that it was irrelevant evidence of another conspiracy, rather than the one charged. With respect to all these instances, we think \n\n[273 U.S. 593, 625]\n\u00a0\n that there was sufficient probable connection with the conspiracy already shown to allow the items of evidence to be introduced, leaving to the jury the weight of it, but that even if in any of such instances there was error, they were merely cumulative proof of the conspiracy which was practically undenied and their admission was harmless.\n The judgment of conviction of the Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOX RIVER PAPER CO. v. RAILROAD COM'N OF WISCONSIN(1927)\nNo. 492\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. E. J. Dempsey, Moses Hooper, and John F. Kluwin, all of Oshkosh, Wis., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[274 U.S. 651, 652]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. M. Rieser, of Madison, Wis., and Adolph Kanneberg, of Madison, Wis., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error are riparian owners of land bordering on the Fox River, a navigable stream. They own a dam at Appleton, Wis., which has been maintained since its construction in 1878 without permission from any state authority. Since 1841 the statutes of the territory, and later of the state, have forbidden the building of a dam on any navigable river without legislative consent. Laws 1841, No. 9; R. S. 1849, c. 34; R. S. 1858, c. 41,  2; 1 Wis. Stat. 1898, c. 70,  1596; 1 Wis. Stat. 1925,  30.01(2).\n By section 31.02, Wis. Stat. 1925, the state Railroad Commission was given supervisory power over the navigable waters of the state, and control of the construction and maintenance of dams in navigable rivers. Section 31.07 authorizes it to grant permits to applicants to operate and maintain existing dams. By section 31.09 every applicant for a permit is required to file with his application proposals in writing, consenting, among other things, to the grant of a permit subject to the condition:\n'That the state of Wisconsin, if it shall have the constitutional power, or any municipality, on not less than one year's notice, at any time after, the expiration of thirty years after the permit becomes effective, may acquire all of the property of the grantee, used and useful under the permit, by paying therefor, the cost of reproduction in their then existing condition of all dams, works, buildings, or other structures or equipment, used and useful under the permit, as determined by the commission, and by paying in addition thereto the value of the dam site and all flowage \n\n[274 U.S. 651, 653]\n\u00a0\n rights and other property as determined by the commission prior to the time the permit was granted, as provided in subsection (1), plus the amounts paid out for additional flowage rights, if any, acquired after the valuation made by the commission as provided in subsection ( 1); and that the applicant waives all right to any further compensation.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error petitioned the commission for permits to maintain and repair their dam, which, they asserted, 'does not materially obstruct navigation or violate other public or private rights or endanger life, health or property.' The application was rejected by the commission solely for want of jurisdiction, since the applicants had omitted to file the proposals required by section 31.09. Plaintiffs brought suit in the nature of a mandamus proceeding on the circuit court of Dane county, Wis., to compel the commission to take jurisdiction of the application and to proceed to a hearing. The bill drew in question the validity of section 31. 09 under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, alleging that the determination of the commission acting under the statute operated to deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. The commission answered, admitting the allegations of fact of the bill, setting up that plaintiffs' dam had been constructed and was maintained without a permit from the state, and that the application had been dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The trial court gave final judgment on the pleadings for defendant in error, upholding the validity of this act. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed by an evenly divided court. 189 Wis. 626, 208 N. W. 266. The case is here on writ of error. Judicial Code ,  237(a), as amended (Comp. St.  1214).\n The right set up in the bill is one under the federal Constitution. Whether the state court denied that right or failed to give it due recognition is a question upon which the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke the judgment \n\n[274 U.S. 651, 654]\n\u00a0\n of this court. Our jurisdiction is not affected because the existence of the right for which constitutional protection is claimed depends upon state law. Cf. West Chicago R. R. v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 506\n, 26 S.

Ct. 569.\n Plaintiffs' case rests on the contention that by the law of Wisconsin the rights vested in riparian owners include the right to use the water power and for that purpose to dam the river, subject only to the exercise by the state of its police power to regulate the use of navigable waters in the public interest, and to protect public health and safety; that to withhold from plaintiffs, as the state does under the statute, the right to use their own property unless they agree to surrender it to the state at a price which may prove at the time of transfer to be less than its true value, is a taking of property without due process, prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We do not pass upon the sufficiency of the compensation provided for by the statute. For the purpose of decision, it may be assumed that the recapture provisions go too far, if the rights of plaintiffs are as described. Hence the point first to be determined is whether plaintiffs' description is accurate. The trial court, the only state court to express an opinion on this question, held that the right of the riparian owner to make use of the water power in a navigable river by maintaining a dam is subordinate to the plenary power of the state to regulate the use or obstruction of navigable waters; that the state may forbid all obstruction by dam or otherwise; hence, the right of the riparian owner to develop water power by the construction of the dam remains inchoate until the state has given its consent.\n'If the Legislature may wholly refuse permission to erect a dam or other structure in the navigable waters of the state, if follows that it may \n\n[274 U.S. 651, 655]\n\u00a0\n grant such permission upon such terms as it shall determine will best protect the interests of the public. The Legislature could impose the condition that the dam should be removed when it obstructed navigation or that it should be removed at the end of a definite period of time, for example, 30 years.'\n\n There being no question of evasion of the constitutional issue ( Nickel v. Cole, \n256 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 41 S. Ct. 467; Union Pac. R. R. v. Public Service Commission, \n248 \nU.S. 67\n, 39 S. Ct. 24; Ward v. Love County, supra, 22 (40 S. Ct. 419); Long Sault Development Co. v. Call, \n242 \nU.S. 272\n, 37 S. Ct. 79), this court on writ of error must accept as final the ruling of the state court of last resort on all matters of state law (Sauer v. New York, \n206 \nU.S. 536\n, 27 S. Ct. 686; Kaukauna Co. v. Green Bay, etc., Canal, \n142 \nU.S. 254, 272\n, 277 S., 12 S. Ct. 173). Although presumptively title to the soil under navigable waters within the state is in the state (Massachusetts v. New York, \n271 \nU.S. 65, 89\n, 46 S. Ct. 357; United States v. Holt State Bank, \n270 \nU.S. 49, 54\n, 46 S. Ct. 197), the nature and extent of the rights of the state and of riparian owners in navigable waters within the state and to the soil beneath are matters of state law to be determined by the statutes and judicial decisions of the state (Kaukauna Co. v. Green Bay, etc., Canal, supra, 272 (12 S. Ct. 173); Packer v. Bird, \n137 \nU.S. 661, 669\n, 11 S. Ct. 210; Hardin v. Jordan, \n140 \nU.S. 371, 382\n, 11 S. Ct. 808, 838; Barney v. Keokuk, \n94 U.S. 324\n, 338). If the state chooses to resign to the riparian proprietor sovereign rights over navigable rivers which it acquired upon assuming statehood, it is not for others to raise objections. Barney v. Keokuk, supra, 338 (24 L. Ed. 224). We assume, although judicial expression is not entirely consistent, that by the law of Wisconsin, in the absence of special circumstances, title to the bed of navigable rivers is in the riparian owner. Kaukauna Co. v. Green Bay, etc., Canal, supra, 272 (12 S. Ct. 173); Willow River Club v. Wade, 100 Wis. 86, 95, 76 N. W. 273, 42 L. R. A. 305; Wisconsin River Improvement Co. v. Lyons, 30 Wis. 61. Cf. Merwin v. Houghton, 146 Wis. 398, 409, 131 N. W. 838. But defend- \n\n[274 U.S. 651, 656]\n\u00a0\n ant contends that in any case the rights of plaintiffs are subordinate to the state control of navigable waters, and as was held in effect by the state court in this case, the riparian owner can have no right in the water power created by damming a navigable river, so long as the state withholds its consent to the construction or maintenance of the dam. Wisconsin River Improvement Co. v. Lyons, supra, 67.\n In so holding it does not appear that the court below ran counter to any established rule of property of the state. An examination of the earlier state decisions discloses no such conflict of authority or inconsistency of judicial opinion on this subject as even to suggest that the court below adopted its view in order to evade the constitutional issue. Nickel v. Cole, supra. The state's consent is necessary for the construction of a bridge or dam in a navigable river, subject to the superior power of the United States over navigation, Barnes v. City of Racine, 4 Wis. 454; Wisconsin River Improvement Co. v. Lyons, supra; and plaintiffs concede that the maintenance of a dam without such permission constitutes a publid nuisance, 1 Wis. Stat., 1925,  31.25. Cf. In re Eldred, 46 Wis. 530, 1 N. W. 175. Riparian use is subject also to the public right of navigation. Cohn v. Wausau Boom Co., 47 Wis. 314, 325, 2 N. W. 546; fishing, Willow River Club v. Wade, supra; and possibly to the right to establish a public water supply by damming the river, Cf. Wisconsin v. City of Eau Claire, 40 Wis. 533. That the holding below presents no novel view appears from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the Water Power Cases, 148, Wis. 124, 134 N. W. 330, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 526, where the court specifically pointed out (page 149 (134 N. W. 330)) that neither the riparian owner nor the state could develop water power by placing a dam in a navigable river resting upon its banks without the consent of the other, and that the state might withhold its permission or grant it on conditions. Cf. Black River Improve- \n\n[274 U.S. 651, 657]\n\u00a0\n ment Co. v. La Crosse Co., 54 Wis. 659, 11 N. W. 443, 41 Am. Rep. 66; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, 33 S. Ct. 667\n\n\n We are not concerned with the correctness of the rule adopted by the state court, its conformity to authority, or its consistency with related legal doctrine. Sauer v. New York, supra. It is for the state court in cases such as this to define rights in land located within the state, and the Fourteenth Amendment, in the absence of an attempt to forestall our review of the constitutional question, affords no protection to supposed rights of property which the state courts determine to be nonexistent.\n We accept as conclusive the state court's view of the nature of the rights of riparian owners. We therefore find in the refusal of the commission to grant the permit no denial of the property rights of plaintiffs and hence no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Compliance with section 31.09 is the price which plaintiffs must pay to secure the right to maintain their dam. Cf. Booth Fisheries v. Industrial Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 208\n, 46 S.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 125\nArgued: January 14, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. George A. King, of Washingon, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant entered into a contract with the government for the construction of certain army cantonment buildings at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, upon a cost plus basis. The contract provided for the reimbursement of the contractor for all expenditures made in performance of the contract, including the cost of 'such bonds, fire, liability and other insurance as the contracting officer (might) approve or require. ... ' Appellant brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the cost of public liability insurance effected by it in connection with the perform- \n\n[273 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n ance of its contract. That court found that the evidence failed to show that the liability insurance in question was ever required or approved by the contracting officer of the government or any person representing him or performing his duties, and gave judgment for the government. 60 Ct. Cl. 654.\n On appeal to this court Judicial Code,  242 and 243 (Comp. St.  1219, 1220), before the amendment of 1925 (43 Stat. 936), appellant seeks to avoid the effect of this finding by pointing out that all the contracts for the construction of army cantonments during the late war were identical in form and that recovery has been allowed for the cost of public liability insurance in connection with the construction of Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky, in Mason & Hanger Co. v. United States, 56 Ct. Cl. 238, affirmed United States v. Mason & Hanger Co., \n260 \nU.S. 323\n, 43 S. Ct. 128, and of Camp Grant, Illinois, in Bates & Rogers Const. Co. v. United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 392. It is urged that the records in those cases show a blanket approval by the government of the expenditures made for liability insurance in the construction of all the army cantonments. But the Court of Claims specifically found that there was no evidence that the present expenditure was required or approved. By that finding we are concluded. Luckenbach Steamship Co. v.

No substantial question is presented by the appeal.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFT. SMITH LIGHT CO. v. PAVING DIST.(1927)\nNo. 269\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph M. Hill and Henry L. Fitzhugh, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., and R. M. Campbell, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. John P. Woods, of Ft. Smith, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error, a board of improvement incorporated by the state of Arkansas, brought suit in the circuit court of Sebastian county, to recover the cost of paving a part of certain streets in Ft. Smith, Ark., occupied by the street railway of plaintiff in error. Plaintiff in error originally operated its railway under a franchise requiring it to do similar paving and limiting it to a maximum fare of 5 cents per passenger. Availing of the permission granted by No. 571 of the Acts of Arkansas 1919, amended by No. 124 of 1921, the company had surrendered in that year its franchise for an indeterminate permit to operate its road. The permit did not fix a maximum fare or require the railway to pave \n\n[274 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n parts of the streets occupied by its tracks, but subjected it to the regulatory powers of a utilities commission.\n In 1923 the Legislature passed a statute, Acts of Arkansas 1923, No. 680, requiring plaintiff in error under certain conditions which have occurred to pave the streets between its rails to the end of the ties. In the event of its failure to do so, the improvement district was authorized to do the paving at the expense of the railway. The act is in form a general statute, but by reason of provisions making it applicable to street railways operating under indeterminate permits in cities of the first class other than in Miller county, it in fact applied to plaintiff in error alone.\n Plaintiff in error having failed to do the required paving, the board completed the improvement and brought the present suit. The company by answer set up that the statutory requirements of paving impaired the obligation of its contract with the state, in violation of article 1,  10, of the federal Constitution, and deprived it of property without of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth of the laws guaranteed by the Fourt Amendment. The judgment of the circuit court for defendant in error was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. 169 Ark. 690, 276 S. W. 1012. The case is here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237, as amended (Comp. St.  1214).\n It is urged that the acceptance of the indeterminate permit under the act of 1919 constituted a contract between the railway and the state by which the state bound itself not to impose any added burdens except in the exercise of its police power; that the requirement for street paving was not an exercise of the police power and was therefore a forbidden impairment of the contract. This contention assumes that the permit exempted the railway from paving costs. But no such exemption appears in the permit. Provisions of this character are not lightly to be read into a contract between a state and a \n\n[274 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n public utility. Durham Public Service Co. v. Durham, \n261 \nU.S. 149, 152\n, 43 S. Ct. 290. Even granting the assumption, the case of Fair Haven R. R. v. New Haven, \n203 \nU.S. 379\n, 27 S. Ct. 74, is a complete answer. There this court held that a general law imposing on a street railway the duty to repair so much of the streets as was occupied by its tracks was an exercise of the power reserved to the state to alter, amend or repeal the original charter and was not an impairment of the obligation of contract. That case controls here since section 6, art. 12, of the Constitution of Arkansas, in force at the time when plaintiff relinquished its franchise and accepted the permit, reserved to the legislature the power to alter any corporate charter. See, also, Sioux City Street Ry. v. Sioux City, \n138 \nU.S. 98\n, 11 S. Ct. 226.\n Assuming the exercise of the power of amendment is subject to the limitation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Shields v. Ohio, \n95 U.S. 319\n, 324; Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin Co., \n192 \nU.S. 201, 213\n, 24 S. Ct. 241), that limitation, as was held in Fair Haven R. R. v. New Haven, supra, is not transcended by a requirement which might have been included in the original charter and which has some reasonable relation to the object of the grant and to the duty of the state to maintain its highways. Cf. Southern Wisconsin Ry. v. Madison, \n240 \nU.S. 457\n, 36 S. Ct. 400; Great Northern Ry. v. State ex rel. Clara City, \n246 \nU.S. 434\n, 38 S. Ct. 346.\n It is said that the act in its application is confiscatory because plaintiff in error must bear this expense, although it is losing money in the operation of its road at the rates for service now prevailing. But the imposition of burdens, otherwise legitimate, upon a public service company, cannot be held invalid as confiscatory because the permitted rate does not allow an adequate return. People ex rel. Woodhaven Gaslight Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 83; Milwaukee Elec. Ry. v. State ex rel. Milwaukee, 252 U. S. \n\n[274 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n 100, 105, 40 S. Ct. 306, 10 A. L. R. 892. Whether the rate is confiscatory is not before us.\n It is also contended that as there are other street railways in the state, some operating under franchises and one under an indeterminate permit, which are not required to do street paving, the challenged act denies the equal protection of the laws. The Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit legislation merely because it is special, or limited in its application to a particular geographical or political subdivision of the state. See Missouri v.

Durham, supra, we perceive no reason why it may not, by a legislative act, make a like requirement limited to a single municipality.\n Nor need we cite authority for the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the uniform application of legislation to objects that are different, where those differences may be made the rational basis of legislative discrimination. There is nothing in the record now before us to show that there is any similarity of plaintiff's road to others in the state with respect to many considerations which might reasonably determine which roads should be required to do street paving. Differences \n\n[274 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n in location, use, and physical character of the streets, the extent to which paving has been completed and local methods of assessing benefits for street paving, are some of the considerations which might reasonably move the Legislature to require street paving of one road or several and not of others.

That court at first made a decree reversing the decree of the District Court, but later, on December 18, 1926, set that decree aside and transferred the case to this court, under the Act of September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 (Comp.

They, the liquor and other \n\n[275 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n property taken, were immediately turned over to a federal deputy collector of customs for prosecution in the federal court for northern New York. There the defendants were promptly indicted for conspiracy to import and transport liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). They moved seasonably, in advance of the trial and again later, for the suppression of the liquor as evidence and for its return, on the ground that the arrest, the search, and the seizure were without a warrant and without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments of the federal Constitution. The motion was denied; the evidence was introduced at the trial; the defendants were found guilty; and they were sentenced to fine and imprisonment. the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. Neither court delivered an opinion. This court granted a writ of certiorari. 274 U.  733, 47 S. Ct. 766\n\n\n The government contends that the evidence was admissible, because there was probable cause (Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 153\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790), and also because it was not shown that the state troopers were, at the time of the arrest, search, and seizure, agents of the United States. The defendants contend that there was not probable cause, and that the state troopers are to be deemed agents of the United States, because section 26 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  40) imposes the duty of arrest and seizure where liquor is being illegally transported, not only upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, his assistants and inspectors, but also upon 'any officer of the law.' We are of opinion on the facts, which it is unnecessary to detail, that there was not probable cause. We are also of opinion that the term 'any officer of the law,' used in section 26, refers only to federal officers, and that the troopers were not at the time of the arrest and seizure, agents of the United States. Compare Dodge v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 530, 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 191. \n\n[275 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n But National Prohibition Act Oct. 28, 1919, c. 85, tit. 2,  2, 41 Stat. 305, 308 (27 USCA  11), contemplated some co-operation between the state and the federal governments in the enforcement of the act. Thus section 2 made applicable the provisions of section 1014 of the Revised Statutes (18 USCA  591), whereby state magistrates were authorized, 'agreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders in such state, and at the expense of the United States,' to arrest and imprison, or bail, offenders against any law of the United States for trial before the federal court, and to require 'recognizances of witnesses for their appearance to testify in the case.' Section 2 also gave specific authority to the state magistrates to issue search warrants under the limitation fixed by the federal statutes. Act June 15, 1917, c. 30, tit. 11, 40 Stat. 217, 228 (18 USCA  611 et seq.). Evidence obtained through wrongful search and seizure by state officers who are co-operating with federal officials must be excluded. See Flagg v. United States (C. C. A.) 233 F. 481, 483, approved in Silverthorne v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S. Ct. 182. In Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28, 34\n, 47 S. Ct. 248, evidence obtained by state officers through search and seizure, made without a warrant and without probable cause, but in the presence of a federal official, was held inadmissible. The question here is whether, although the state troopers were not agents of the United States, their relation to the federal prosecution was such as to require the exclusion of the evidence wrongfully obtained.\n The Mullan-Gage Law-the state prohibition act-had been repealed in 1923. Act June 1, 1923, c. 871; Laws N. Y. 1923, p. 1690. There is no suggestion that the defendants were committing, at the time of the arrest, search, and seizure, any state offense, or that they had done so in the past, or that the troopers believed that they had. Unless the troopers were authorized to make the arrest, search, and seizure, because they were aiding in the enforcement of a law of the United States, their action \n\n[275 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n would clearly have been wrongful, even if they had had positive knowledge that the defendants were violating the federal law. No federal official was present at the search and seizure, and the defendants made no attempt to establish that the particular search and seizure was made in co- operation with federal officials. But facts of which we take judicial notice (compare Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 130\n, 39 S. Ct. 56), make it clear that the state troopers believed that they were required by law to aid in enforcing the National Prohibition Act, and that they made this arrest, search, and seizure, in the performance of that supposed duty, solely for the purpose of aiding in the federal prosecution.\n In the memorandum filed by the Governor approving the act which repealed the Mullan-Gage Law, he declared that all peace officers, thus including state troopers, are officers, to aid in the enforcement of the federal law 'with as much force and as much vigor as including state troopers, are required and that the repeal of the Mullan-Gage Law should make no difference in their action, except that thereafter the peace officers must take the offender to the federal court for prosecution. \n1\n Aid so given was accepted and acted on by the federal officials. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[275 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n It appears that one of the troopers who made the arrest and seizure here in question had been stationed at the Canadian border for 18 months prior thereto, the greater part of that period being after the repeal of the Mullan-Gage Law. It was also shown that, immediately after the arrest and seizure, the defendants, their car, and the liquor were, after they had been taken to the committing magistrate, turned over to the federal officers. In view of these facts, the statement, in the affidavit of one of the troopers, that at the time of the arrest and search 'there were no federal officers present, and that we were not working in conjunction with federal officers,' must be taken to mean merely that the specific arrest and search was not directly participated in by any federal officer.\n We are of opinion that the admission in evidence of the liquor wrongfully seized violated rights of the defendants guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The wrongful arrest, search, and seizure were made solely on behalf of the United States. The evidence so secured was the foundation for the prosecution and supplied the only evidence of guilt. It is true that the troopers were not shown to have acted under the directions of the federal officials in making the arrest and seizure. But the rights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments may be invaded as effectively by such co-operation as by the state officers acting under direction of the federal officials. Compare Silverthorne v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S. Ct. 182. The prosecution thereupon instituted by the federal au- \n\n[275 U.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n thorities was, as conducted, in effect a ratification of the arrest, search, and seizure made by the troopers on behalf of the United States. Whether the laws of the state actually imposed upon the troopers the duty of aiding the federal officials in the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act we have no occasion to inquire.\n The conclusion here reached is not in conflict with any of the earlier decisions of this court in which evidence wrongfully secured by persons other than federal officers has been held admissible in prosecutions for federal crimes. For in none of those cases did it appear that the search and seizure was made solely for the purpose of aiding the United States in the enforcement of its laws. In Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, the papers not ordered returned had been obtained by a policeman who searched the defendant's home after his arrest by another state officer. Pages 386, 398 (34 S. Ct. 341). It was not shown there that either the arrest or the search was made solely for the purpose of aiding in the prosecution of the federal offense. A law of the state made criminal the acts with which the defendant was charged,3 and the seizure may have been made in enforcing the state law. In Center v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 575\n, 45 S. Ct. 230 (per curiam), the liquor admitted in evidence had been taken by the state officials for immediate use in the state courts. Proceedings against the defendant, the car, and the liquor were instituted there four months before the prosecution in the federal court was begun. In Dodge v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 530\n, 47 S. Ct. 191, a libel to forfeit a vessel which had originally been seized by a state officer, the question presented was one of jurisdiction. The court in sustaining the jurisdiction, although the original seizure had been made by the state officer without authority, said (page 532 (47 S. Ct. 192)): 'The exclusion of evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seiz- \n\n[275 U.S. 310, 318]\n\u00a0\n ure stands on a different ground.' In Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 574, 65 L Ed. 1048, 13 A. L. R. 1159, the books and papers admitted had been taken by private detectives. The District Court ordered the return 'solely upon the ground that the government should not use stolen property for any purpose after demand made for its return.' Page 472 (41 S. Ct. 575). This court based its reversal on the finding that 'the record clearly shows that no official of the federal government had anything to do with the wrongful seizure of the petitioner's property, or any knowledge thereof until several months after the property had been taken from him and was in the possession of the Cities Service Company.' Page 475 (41 S. Ct. 576).\n There have been many instances in which the lower federal courts have admitted evidence obtained by state officers through wrongful search and seizure, but only three reported cases have been found in which it could have been seriously contended, in view of the law of the state and the facts appearing in the opinion, that the search and seizure had been made solely for the purpose of aiding in the enforcement of the federal law. Schroeder v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 60; Greenberg v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 65; Katz v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 67. These cases, like the present one, were decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and involved searches and seizures made by officers of New York subsequent to the repeal of the Mullan-Gage Law. \n4\n An examination of the record in the Schroeder Case discloses that the sergeant of police who made the search and seizure was not acting solely to enforce the National Prohibition Act. He was a confidential investigator, charged with the task of detecting cor- \n\n[275 U.S. 310, 319]\n\u00a0\n ruption and other derelictions of duty on the part of police officers; the defendant was likewise a police officer, and the sergeant, on making the search and seizure, informed the defendant that he was acting in pursuance of his regular duties. These facts were relied upon by the government in both the trial and the appellate court. In the Greenbery and Katz Cases the situation was wholly different. The Court of Appeals, failing to note the difference, treated its decision in the Schroeder Case as controlling, and did not give adequate consideration to the peculiar relation borne in New York, then as now, by state officers to federal prohibition enforcement, although the point was made by the defendant and a decision thereon was urgently sought by the United States attorney.\n The record in the case at bar does not show that the relation between the state troopers and the federal agencies for prohibition enforcement was called by counsel to the attention of the court. But as the conviction of these defendants rests wholly upon evidence obtained by invasion of their constitutional rights, we are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.

CHOCTAW NATION(1927)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry Peyton, of Washington, D. C., for appellants Garland heirs.\n Messrs. Harry Peyton, T. P. Gore, and W. W. Scott, all of Washington, D. C., for appellants Pitchlynn.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for appellee. \n\n[272 U.S. 728, 729]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes, although heard separately and upon different records, may be disposed of conveniently by one opinion.\n Samuel Garland, Peter P. Pitchlynn and two others were appointed delegates of the Choctaw Nation under an Act of the Legislative Assembly approved November 9, 1853, and charged with the duty of pressing to settlement a claim against the United States for ceded lands. They performed valuable services and each of them received therefor considerable sums of money. Their heirs sought large additional payments. Finally Congress referred the matter to the Court of Claims. The Act of June 21, 1906, c. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 345, provides:\n'That the Court of Claims is hereby authorized and directed to hear and adjudicate the claims against the Choctaw Nation of the heirs of Peter P. Pitchlynn, deceased, and to render judgment thereon in such amounts, if any, as may appear to be equitably due. Said judgment, if any, in favor of the heirs of Pitchlynn, shall be paid out of any funds in the Treasury of the United States belonging to the Choctaw Nation, said judgment to be rendered on the principle of quantum meruit for services rendered and expenses incurred. Notice of said suit shall be served on the governor of the Choctaw Nation, and the Attorney General of the United States shall appear and defend in said suit on behalf of said nation.'\n\n A like act, approved May 29, 1908 (35 Stat. 444, 445, c. 216), directed adjudication of the claim of Samuel Garland, deceased.\n Garland's heirs brought suit in the Court of Claims September 3, 1908. It held against them upon the theory that the delegation which represented the Choctaw Nation should be treated as a unit and as such had been fully \n\n[272 U.S. 728, 730]\n\u00a0\n paid for the entire service. Upon appeal, this court reversed that judgment and sent the cause back, after saying:\n'The contention under the facts disclosed in the petition is technical. The petition showed services rendered and if, the petition be true, valuable services-and for them there should have been recovery if the Nation was liable, and we think it was. How much we do not say nor did the Court of Claims considered, it being of opinion that the Nation was not liable for anything. Upon the return of the case it may determine the amount due Garland, if anything, dependent upon what his services contributed in securing the congressional appropriation.' Garland's Heirs v. Choctaw Nation, \n256 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 41 S. Ct. 579, 581 (65 L. Ed. 1038).\n\n Much evidence has been presented in both causes and there are elaborate findings. The court held the heirs of Garland-No. 42-were not entitled to recover anything, and dismissed their petition. It rendered judgment for $3,113.90 in favor of Pitchlynn's heirs-No. 43. The causes are here by appeals allowed, respectively, January 19 and February 2, 1925\n\n\n In neither cause did the Court of Claims definitely find the value of the services rendered by the delegate, but it ascertained and stated the sums received by each of them. By dismissing the petition of Garland's heirs, it adjudged, in effect, that he had received full compensation; and the judgment in favor of Pitchlynn's heirs for $3,113.92 determined that the amount theretofore received plus such recovery would amount to full compensation for his services.\n We think the findings of fact sufficient to permit us to dispose of the causes, and accordingly deny the motion to remand.\n The enabling acts very cleary provide for recoveries upon the principle of quantum meruit for services rendered and expenses incurred. The Court of Claims was not \n\n[272 U.S. 728, 731]\n\u00a0\n bound to accept opinions of the legislature or executive officers of the Choctaw Nation; its duty was to determine for itself what the services were worth. After consideration of the evidence it reached the above- stated conclusions, and we find no adequate reason for overturning the result.\n The judgments below are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGETOWN NAT. BANK v. MCFARLAND(1927)\nNo. 78\nArgued: December 13, 1926Decided: March 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. T. Kennedy Helm and Edmund F. Trabue, both of Louisville, Ky., \n\n[273 U.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. H. Church Ford, of Georgetown, Ky., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, a national banking association located in Scott county, Ky., brought suit in the circuit court of that county to enjoin defendants in error, tax officials of the county, from assessing or collecting taxes on the shares of stock of plaintiff in error on the ground that the assessment and tax were at a higher rate than that assessed on moneyed capital employed in competition with the business of national banks, and hence prohibited by section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  9784). Judgment for the plaintiff was reversed by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. McFarland v. Georgetown Nat. Bank, 208 Ky. 7, 270 S. W. 995. The case comes here on writ of error, and disposition of it may be made upon the principles applied in First National Bank of Hartford v. City of Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548\n, 48 S. Ct. 462, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this day.\n By section 4019a, subsection 10 (Carroll's Ky. Stat. 1922), money in hand, notes, bonds, and other credits, whether secured by mortgage, pledge, or otherwise, or unsecured, are subject to taxation for state purposes only at the rate of 40 cents per $100. By section 4092 of the same act, shares in national banks, state banks, and trust companies are placed in a separate class and made subject both to the state tax at the forty-cent rate and to local taxes as well. The statute thus discriminates in favor of moneyed capital in the form of credits, which are subject only to the state tax.\n Plaintiff in error, seeking to establish that the favored capital was in competition with national banks, relied \n\n[273 U.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n principally upon the proof that there were substantial amounts of capital invested in the state by individuals in bonds, notes, accounts, and mortgages, aggregating approximately $1,500,000, which it is contended represents moneyed capital in competition with national banks. But plaintiff made no attempt to show that there were other businesses or courses of investment in the state employing moneyed capital in competition with its business or that of other national banks. The evidence with respect to capital invested by individuals, taken as a whole, falls short of establishing that the capital thus used is employed substantially as in the loan and investment features of banking in making investments by way of loan or discount, or in notes, bonds, and other securities, with a view to sale or repayment and reinvestment.\n The Court of Appeals of Kentucky, following the state practice, reviewed the evidence, concluding from it that:\n'No material part of the capital held by the individuals is so invested as to come in competition with the national banks.'\n\n The evidence is set forth in the record. In some particulars it is conflicting, and the conflicts are such that their resolution by the Court of Appeals should be accepted by us. It cannot be said either that the finding is without evidence to support it or that it certainly is against the weight of the evidence. In the course of the opinion the Court of Appeals gave more attention than we think justified to the difference between short-time and long-time loans and to the readiness with which the banks obtain loans, notwithstanding the competition alleged; but, even after making due allowance for this, we think the finding should not be disturbed. It does not depart from, but gives effect to, the principles announced in the decision just made in First National Bank of Hartford v. City of Hartford.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGONG LUM v. RICE(1927)\nNo. 29\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. James N. Flowers, of Jackson, Miss., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Rush H. Knox, of Jackson, Miss., and E. C. Sharp, of Corinth, Miss., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a petition for mandamus filed in the state circuit court of Mississippi for the First judicial district of Bolivar county.\n Gong Lum is a resident of Mississippi, resides in the Rosedale consolidated high school district, and is the father of Martha Lum. He is engaged in the mercantile business. Neither he nor she was connected with the consular service, or any other service, of the government of China, or any other government, at the time of her birth. \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n She was nine years old when the petition was filed, having been born January 21, 1915, and she sued by her next friend, Chew How, who is a nativeborn citizen of the United States and the state of Mississippi. The petition alleged that she was of good moral character, between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and that, as she was such a citizen and an educable child, it became her father's duty under the law to send her to school; that she desired to attend the Rosedale consolidated high school; that at the opening of the school she appeared as a pupil, but at the noon recess she was notified by the superintendent that she would not be allowed to return to the school; that an order had been issued by the board of trustees, who are made defendants, excluding her from attending the school solely on the ground that she was of Chinese descent, and not a member of the white or Caucasian race, and that their order had been made in pursuance to instructions from the state superintendent of education of Mississippi, who is also made a defendant.\n The petitioners further show that there is no school maintained in the district for the education of children of Chinese descent, and none established in Bolivar county where she could attend.\n The Constitution of Mississippi (Const. 1890,  201, 206) requires that there shall be a county common school fund, made up of poll taxes from the various counties, to be retained in the counties where the same is collected, and a state common school fund to be taken from the general fund in the state treasury, which together shall be sufficient to maintain a common school for a term of four months in each scholastic year, but that any county or separate school district may levy an additional tax to maintain schools for a longer time than a term of four months, and that the said common school fund shall be distributed among the several counties and separate school districts in proportion to the number of educable children in each, to be collected \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n from the data in the office of the state superintendent of education in the manner prescribed by law; that the Legislature encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement, by the establishment of a uniform system of free public schools by taxation or otherwise, for all children between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and as soon as practicable, establish schools of higher grade.\n The petition alleged that, in obedience to this mandate of the Constitution, the Legislature has provided for the establishment and for the payment of the expenses of the Rosedale consolidated high school, and that the plaintiff, Gong Lum, the petitioner's father, is a taxpayer and helps to support and maintain the school; that Martha Lum is an educable child, is entitled to attend the school as a pupil, and that this is the only school conducted in the district available for her as a pupil; that the right to attend it is a valuable right; that she is not a member of the colored race, nor is she of mixed blood, but that she is pure Chinese; that she is by the action of the board of trustees and the state superintendent discriminated against directly, and denied her right to be a member of the Rosedale school; that the school authorities have no discretion under the law as to her admission as a pupil in the school, but that they continue without authority of law to deny her the right to attend it as a pupil. For these reasons the writ of mandamus is prayed for against the defendants, commanding them and each of them to desist from discriminating against her on account of her race or ancestry, and to give her the same rights and privileges that other educable children between the ages of 5 and 21 are granted in the Rosedale consolidated high school.\n The petition was demurred to by the defendants on the ground, among others, that the bill showed on its face that plaintiff is a member of the Mongolian or yellow race, and \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n therefore not entitled to attend the schools provided by law in the state of Mississippi for children of the white or Caucasian race.\n The trial court overruled the demurrer and ordered that a writ of mandamus issue to the defendants as prayed in the petition.\n The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which heard the case. Rice v. Gong Lum, 139 Miss. 760, 104 So. 105. In its opinion, it directed its attention to the proper construction of section 207 of the state Constitution of 1890, which provides:\n'Separate schools shall be maintained for children of the white and colored races.'\n\n The court held that this provision of the Constitution divided the educable children into those of the pure white or Caucasian race, on the one hand, and the brown, yellow, and black races, on the other, and therefore that Martha Lum, of the Mongolian or yellow race, could not insist on being classed with the whites under this constitutional division. The court said:\n'The Legislature is not compelled to provide separate schools for each of the colored races, and unless and until it does provide such schools, and provide for segregation of the other races, such races are entitled to have the benefit of the colored public schools. Under our statutes a colored public school exists in every county and in some convenient district, in which every colored child is entitled to obtain an education. These schools are within the reach of all the children of the state, and the plaintiff does not show by her petition that she applied for admission to such schools. On the contrary, the petitioner takes the position that, because there are no separate public schools for Mongolians, she is entitled to enter the white public schools in preference to the colored public schools. A consolidated school in this state is simply a common school conducted as other common schools are conducted; \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n the only distinction being that two or more school districts have been consolidated into one school. Such consolidation is entirely discretionary with the county school board, having reference to the condition existing in the particular territory. Where a school district has an unusual amount of territory, with an unusual valuation of property therein, it may levy additional taxes. But the other common schools under similar statutes have the same power.\n\n'If the plaintiff desires, she may attend the colored public schools of her district, or, if she does not so desire, she may go to a private school. The compulsory school law of this state does not require the attendance at a public school, and a parent under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States has a right to educate his child in a private school if he so desires. But plaintiff is not entitled to attend a white public school.'\n\n As we have seen, the plaintiffs aver that the Rosedale consolidated high school is the only school conducted in that district available for Martha Lum as a pupil. They also aver that there is no school maintained in the district of Bolivar county for the education of Chinese children, and none in the county. How are these averments to be reconciled with the statement of the state Supreme Court that colored schools are maintained in every county by virtue of the Constitution? This seems to be explained, in the language of the state Supreme Court, as follows:\n'By statute it is provided that all the territory of each county of the state shall be divided into school districts separately for the white and colored races; that is to say, the whole territory is to be divided into white school districts, and then a new division of the county for colored school districts. In other words, the statutory scheme is to make the districts, outside of the separate school districts, districts for the particular race, white or colored, so that the territorial limits of the school districts need \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n not be the same, but the territory embraced in a school district for the colored race may not be the same territory embraced in the school district for the white race, and vice versa, which system of creating the common school districts for the two races, white and colored, do not require schools for each race as such to be maintained in each district; but each child, no matter from what territory, is assigned to some school district, the school buildings being separately located and separately controlled, but each having the same curriculum, and each having the same number of months of school term, if the attendance is maintained for the said statutory period, which school district of the common or public schools has certain privileges, among which is to maintain a public school by local taxation for a longer period of time than the said term of four months under named conditions which apply alike to the common schools for the white and colored races.'\n\n We must assume, then, that there are school districts for colored children in Bolivar county, but that no colored school is within the limits of the Rosedale consolidated high school district. This is not inconsistent with there being at a place outside of that district and in a different district, a colored school which the plaintiff Martha Lum may conveniently attend. If so, she is not denied, under the existing school system, the right to attend and enjoy the privileges of a common school education in a colored school. If it were otherwise, the petition should have contained an allegation showing it. Had the petition alleged specifically that there was no colored school in Martha Lum's neighborhood to which she could conveniently go, a different question would have been presented, and this, without regard to the state Supreme Court's construction of the state Constitution as limiting the white schools provided for the education of children of the white or Caucasian race. But we do not find the petition to present such a situation.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n The case then reduces itself to the question whether a state can be said to afford to a child of Chinese ancestry, born in this country and a citizen of the United States, the equal protection of the laws, by giving her the opportunity for a common school education in a school which receives only colored children of the brown, yellow or black races.\n The right and power of the state to regulate the method of providing for the education of its youth at public expense is clear. In Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education, \n175 \nU.S. 528, 545\n, 20 S. Ct. 197, 201, persons of color sued the board of education to enjoin it from maintaining a high school for white children without providing a similar school for colored children, which had existed and had been discontinued. Mr. Justice Harlan, in delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'Under the circumstances disclosed, we cannot say that this action of the state court was, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, a denial by the state to the plaintiffs and to those associated with them of the equal protection of the laws, or of any privileges belonging to them as citizens of the United States. We may add that, while all admit that the benefits and burdens of public taxation must be shared by citizens without discrimination against any class on account of their race, the education of the people in schools maintained by state taxation is a matter belonging to the respective states, and any interference on the part of federal authority with the management of such schools cannot be justified, except in the case of a clear and unmistakable disregard of rights secured by the supreme law of the land.'\n\n The question here is whether a Chinese citizen of the United States is denied equal protection of the laws when he is classed among the colored rances and furnished facilities for education equal to that offered to all, whether white, brown, yellow, or black. Were this a new question, \n\n[275 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n it would call for very full argument and consideration; but we think that it is the same question which has been many times decided to be within the constitutional power of the state Legislature to settle, without intervention of the federal courts under the federal Constitution.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 90\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. George Rublee and Spencer Gordon, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[273 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to April 11, 1921, the par value of the outstanding capital stock of appellant, an Ohio corporation, was $100 per share. On that date this par value was reduced to $1 a share by appellant's filing a proper certificate of reduction with the secretary of state, pursuant to the laws of Ohio. No new certificates of stock were issued in place of the old which remained outstanding and stated on their face that they were of the par value of $100. After the reduction of the par value of the stock, the holders of 534,849 shares, evidenced by the old certificates, transferred them to voting trustees in order to carry out a plan of reorganization. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue demanded a stamp tax on the transfer computed upon the apparent par value of $100 as indicated on the face of the certificates, and not on the actual reduced value of $1 per share, which appellant contended was the proper tax base. Appellant paid the tax at the higher rate under protest and brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the excess. From a judgment in favor of the government, the case comes here on appeal. Judicial Code,  242, prior to the amendment of February 13, 1925 (Comp. St.  1219).\n The sole question presented is whether the tax assessed is to be measured by the actual par value of the stock as disclosed by the amended charter of the corporation at the time of the transfer or by the value printed on the certificates themselves. The applicable revenue statutes are the acts of 1918 and 1921, as some of the transfers here involved were made while the act of 1918 was in force and others after the act of 1921 had taken effect. Section 1100 and Schedule A of title 11 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. \n\n[273 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n 1133, 1135 (Comp. St. 1919,  6318i and page 1283)), which, so far as material here, are identical with section 1100 and Schedule A of title 11 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 301, 304 ( Comp. St. 1923,  6318i, and page 1956)), impose a stamp tax of 2 cents per '$100 of face value or fraction thereof' 'on all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales, or deliveries of, or transfers of legal title to shares or certificates of stock.' The pertinent provisions of this section are printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The tax is not a tax on certificates of stock but upon the transfer of legal title of shares or certificates of stock. Compare Provost v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 443\n, 46 S. Ct. 152. The payment of the tax must be evidenced by stamps to be affixed either to the delivered certificate or other document manifesting the transfer. The Treasury Department has consistently ruled that the tax applies to transfers even though no certificates be issued. 40 Treas. Regulations, art. 12(b).\n The statutory measure of the tax is the 'face value' of the stock transferred. It was conceded by the government, both here and below, that the phrase face value in the statute is synonymous with par value. It is used in contradistinction to the actual value which is made the measure of the tax when applied to nonpar value stock which the statute describes as 'without par or face value.' To say that the term 'face value' is intended to apply to a fictitious statement of value on the face of the certificates, having no relation to the actual par value, would be to give the statute a strained construction and \n\n[273 U.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n open the way for evasion. Obviously the face or par value of the stock transferred is to be determined by an inspection of the instrument which alone fixes par value, namely, the corporate charter. The statements in the certificate of incorporation as amended and not those appearing on the face of the stock certificates control. It follows that the measure of the tax here was the actual par value of the stock transferred and that a recovery of the excess tax paid should have been allowed.\n This conclusion is not inconsistent with the decision in United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, urged in support of the assessment as made. There, in applying a documentary tax, the form and terms of the instrument controlled in determining whether the instrument was subject to the tax. Compare Malley v. Bowditch (C. C. A.) 259 F. 809; Danville Building Ass'n v. Pickering (D. C.) 294 F. 117; Haverty Furniture Co. v. United States (D. C.) 286 F. 985; Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. McClain (C. C.) 112 F. 787; Granby Mercantile Co. v. Webster (C. C.) 98 F. 604. But here the tax was levied on the transfer rather than on any particular document and applies to transfers not evidenced by a writing. It is measured by evidence extrinsic to any document to which the stamp is affixed, found only in the corporate charter.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Capital stock, sales or transfers: On all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales or deliveries of, or transfers of legal title to shares or certificates of stock ... whether made upon or shown by the books of the corporation, or by any assignment in blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or other evidence of transfer or sale, whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such stock, interest, or rights, or not, on each $100 of face value or fraction thereof, 2 cents, and where such shares are without par or face value, the tax shall be 2 cents on the transfer or sale or agreement to sell on each share. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGORIEB v. FOX(1927)\nNo. 799\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 603, 604]\n\u00a0\n Mr. G. A. Wingfield, of Roanoke, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles D. Fox, Jr., of Roanoke, Va., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For the declared purpose of establishing building lines and regulating and restricting the construction and location of buildings, and for other purposes, an ordinance of Roanoke, Va., divides the city into 'business' and 'residential' districts. Another ordinance, as amended July 11, 1924, creates a set-back or building line, with relation to the street, to which all buildings subsequently erected must conform. The line must be at least as far from the street as that occupied by 60 per cent. of the existing houses in the block; the word 'block' being de- \n\n[274 U.S. 603, 605]\n\u00a0\n fined to mean only that portion on the same side of the street where the new building is proposed, bounded by the nearest intersecting streets to the right and left thereof. The city council by a proviso reserved to itself the authority to make exceptions and permit the erection of buildings closer to the street.\n Petitioner owns several building lots within the residential district, upon one of which he has a dwelling house. He applied to the city council for a permit to erect a brick store building upon an adjoining lot, and, after investigation, the council by resolution gave him permission to erect a brick store 34 2\/3 feet back from the street line. He thereupon sought by mandamus to compel the council to issue a permit to occupy the lot for his building up to the street line, alleging the unconstitutionality of the set-back ordinance. The judgment of the court of first instance was against him, sustaining the validity of the ordinance and the action of the council. This judgment was affirmed by the state Supreme Court (145 Va. 554, 134 S. E. 914), which held that the ordinance was valid and within the legislative grant of power. Acts of Assembly 1922, p. 46, c. 43.\n The ordinances summarized above were those in effect when the permit was granted by the council, and they alone are involved in this inquiry. The attack here is upon the set-back ordinance, and that is assailed as contravening the due process of law and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.\n It is said, first, that the standard furnished is so vague and uncertain as in reality to be no standard at all, since the houses, or 60 per cent. of them, in any block, may stand at a variety of distances from the street, in which event it cannot be determined from the ordinance whether \n\n[274 U.S. 603, 606]\n\u00a0\n 60 per cent. of the houses nearest to the street, or 60 per cent. of those farthest from the street, or some other method of calculation, is to govern. But in the present case this contention may be put aside, since (a) the permit was granted and the building line fixed under the proviso which reserved to the council in appropriate cases authority to fix the building line without reference to this limitation; and (b) as to the existing houses in the block in question, the actual differences in respect of the building lines upon which more than 60 per cent. of them stood are so slight as to be entirely negligible upon the question of certainty.\n The evidence shows that the varation in the location of 80 per cent. of the existing houses was only one-tenth of a foot, and, ignoring this inconsequential difference, the established building line was slightly over 42 feet back from the street. The line designated for petitioner's building was substantially more favorable to him than this, being more than 7 feet nearer the street. Whether the provision of the ordinance, fixing the line with relation to the location of 60 per cent. of the existing houses, in its general, or in some other specific, application is so vague as to amount to a denial of due process, is a question which does not concern petitioner, since, as applied to the facts in the present case, it is definite enough, and since, in any event, he has been excepted from the operation of the provision, and it does not appear that the alleged unconstitutional feature of which he complains has injured him or operated to deprive him of any right under the federal Constitution.

Ct. 359.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 603, 607]\n\u00a0\n The proviso, under which the council acted, also is attacked as violating the equal protection clause, on the ground that such proviso enables the council unfairly to discriminate between lot owners by fixing unequal distances from the street for the erection of buildings of the same character under like circumstances. We cannot, of course, construe the ordinance as meaning that the power may be thus exerted; nor may we assume in advance that it will be exercised by the council capriciously, arbitrarily, or with inequality. It will be time enough to complaint when, if ever, the power shall be thus abused.\n The proviso evidently proceeds upon the consideration that an inflexible applicabtion of the ordinance may under some circumstances result in unnecessary hardship. In laying down a general rule, such as the one with which we are here concerned, the practical impossibility of anticipating in advance and providing in specific terms for every exceptional case which may arise, is apparent. And yet the inclusion of such cases may well result in great and needless hardship, entirely disproportionate to the good which will result from a literal enforcement of the general rule. Hence the wisdom and necessity here of reserving the authority to determine whether, in specific cases of need exceptions may be made without subverting the general purposes of the ordinance. We think it entirely plain that the reservation of authority in the present ordinance to deal in a special manner with such exceptional cases is unassailable upon constitutional grounds. Wilson v. Eureka City, \n173 U.S. 32\n, 36-37, 19 S. Ct. 317; In re Flaherty, 105 Cal. 558, 562, 38 P. 981, 27 L. R. A. 529; Ex parte Fiske, 72 Cal. 125, 127, 13 P. 310.\n Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n, 6 S. Ct. 1064, upon which petitioner relies, is not to the contrary. The ordinance there involved vested uncontrolled discretion in the board of supervisors, and this discretion was actually exercised for the express purpose of depriving the petitioner in that \n\n[274 U.S. 603, 608]\n\u00a0\n 'case of a privilege that was extended to others. See Crowley v. Christensen, \n137 \nU.S. 86, 94\n, 11 S. Ct. 13.\n The remaining contention is that the ordinance, by compelling petitioner to set his building back from the street line of his lot, deprives him of his property without due process of law. Upon that question the decisions are divided as they are in respect of the validity of zoning regulations generally. But after full consideration of the conflicting decisions, we recently have held, in Euclid v. Ambler Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365\n, 47 S. Ct. 114, that comprehensive zoning laws and ordinances, prescribing, among other things, the height of buildings to be erected (Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91\n, 29 S. Ct. 567) and the extent of the area to be left open for light and air, and in aid of fire protection, etc., are, in their general scope, valid under the federal Constitution. It is hard to see any controlling difference between regulations which require the lot owner to leave open areas at the sides and rear of his house and limit the extent of his use of the space above his lot and a regulation which requires him to set his building a reasonable distance back from the street. Each interferes in the same way, if not to the same extent, with the owner's general right of dominion over his property. All rest for their justification upon the same reasons which have arisen in recent times as a result of the great increase and concentration of population in urban communities and the vast changes in the extent and complexity of the problems of modern city life. Euclid v. Ambler Co., supra, page 386 (47 S. Ct. 114). State Legislatures and city councils, who deal with the situation from a practical standpoint, are better qualified than the courts to determine the necessity, character, and degree of regulation which these new and perplexing conditions require; and their conclusions should not be disturbed by the courts, unless clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. Zahn v. Board of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325\n, 47 S. Ct. 594, and authorities cited, decided May 16, 1927. \n\n[274 U.S. 603, 609]\n\u00a0\n The property here involved forms part of a residential district within which, it is fair to assume, permission to erect business buildings is the exception and not the rule. The members of the city council, as a basis for the ordinance, set forth in their answer that front yards afford room for lawns and trees, keep the dwellings farther from the dust, noise, and fumes of the street, add to the attractiveness and comfort of a residential district, create a better home environment, and, by securing a greater distance between houses on opposite sides of the street, reduce the fire hazard; that the projection of a building beyond the front line of the adjacent dwellings cuts off light and air from them, and, by interfering with the view of street corners, constitutes a danger in the operation of automobiles. We cannot deny the existence of these grounds- indeed, they seem obvious. Other grounds, of like tendency, have been suggested. The highest court of the state, with greater familiarity with the local conditions and facts upon which the ordinance was based than we possess, has sustained its constitutionality; and that decision is entitled to the greatest respect and, in a case of this kind, should be interfered with only if in our judgment it is plainly wrong (Welch v. Swasey, supra, page 106 (29 S. Ct. 567)), a conclusion which, upon the record before us, it is impossible for us to reach.\n The courts, it is true as already suggested, are in disagreement as to the validity of set-back requirements. An examination discloses that one group of decisions holds that such requirements have no rational relation to the public safety, health, morals, or general welfare, and cannot be sustained as a legitimate exercise of the police power. The view of the other group is exactly to the contrary. In the Euclid Case, upon a review of the decisions, we rejected the basic reasons upon which the decisions in the first group depend and accepted those upon which rests the opposite view of the other group. \n\n[274 U.S. 603, 610]\n\u00a0\n Nothing we think is to be gained by a similar review in respect of the specific phases of the general question which is presented here. As to that, it is enough to say that, in consonance with the principles announced in the Euclid Case, and upon what, in the light of present day conditions, seems to be the better reason, we sustain the view put forward by the latter group of decisions, of which the following are representative: Windsor v. Whitney, 95 Conn. 357, 111 A. 354, 12 A. L. R. 669; Matter of Wulfsohn v. Burden, 241 N. Y. 288, 303, 150 N. E. 120, 43 A. L. R. 651; Lincoln Trust Co. v. Williams Bldg. Corporation, 229 N. Y. 313, 128 N. E. 209.\n Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137\n, 33 S. Ct. 76. 57 L. Ed. 156, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1123, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 192, which is petitioner's main reliance upon this point, presented an altogether different question. The ordinance there considered required the committee on streets to fix a building line upon the request of the owners of two-thirds of the property abutting on any street. The ordinance was held bad by this court (page 143 ( 33  Ct. 77)) because it left no discretion in the committee:\n'The action of the committee is determined by two-thirds of the property owners. In other words, part of the property owners fronting on the block determine the extent of use that other owners shall make of their lots, and against the restriction they are impotent. This we emphasize. One set of owners determine not only the extent of use but the kind of use which another set of owners may make of thier property.'\n\n And the court expressly declined (page 144 (33 S. Ct. 77)) to consider the power of a city to establish a building line or regulate the structure or height of buildings.\n Since upon consideration we are unable to say that the ordinance under review is 'clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare,' we are bound to sustain it as constitutional.

St.  3115 1\/2 i), which confers upon the district courts jurisdiction to enter 'such orders and decrees, and to issue such process as may be necessary and proper in the premises to enforce the provisions of this act.' It was brought on February 7, 1925, in the federal court for southern New York. The Alien Property Custodian was the plaintiff; the Great Northern Railway way Company and the Central Union Trust Company the defendants. The relief sought is that the Great Northern be ordered to cancel upon its books and records designated certificates for shares of its stock standing in names of or held for enemies; that it issue new certificates therefor in the names of certain trust companies as depositaries for the Custodian; that the Central Union be ordered to countersign the new certificates as Registrar of Transfers; and that the new certificates so countersigned be delivered to the Custodian without his presenting and surrendering the old ones. The defendants entered a general appearance. On the pleadings and facts stipulated, the court entered a final decree, which required the issue, countersigning, and delivery of the new certificates without presentation or surrender of those outstanding. Rights arising under the Constitution and treaties are alleged to have been violated. On this ground, a direct appeal was taken to this Court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), as it stood prior to the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936).\n During the war the Great Northern filed with the Custodian, from time to time, the reports required by section 7(a) of the act (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 d). All of these reports, except one, contained lists of persons who were registered owners of specified numbers of shares and were believed to be ene- \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n mies. One report stated that Lieber & Co., believed to be an enemy, was believed to be the beneficial owner of shares standing in the name of A. Biederman & Co. All these reports stated that the actual location of the certificates representing said shares was unknown to the company. In consequence of these reports, the Custodian made upon the Great Northern demands in writing in respect to the shares therein referred to. All these demands were made during the war, and all were in substantially the same form. The construction and effect of that document are the principal matters in controversy. The part of it requiring special consideration is this:\n'To Great Northern Railway Company, Address 32 Nassau St., New York, N. Y.:\n\n'I, A. Mitchell Palmer, Alien Property Custodian, duly appointed, qualified, and acting under the provisions of the act of Congress known as the 'Trading with the Enemy Act,' approved October 6, 1917, and the executive orders issued in pursuance thereof, by virtue of the authority vested in me by said act, and by said executive orders, after investigation do determine that Albertine, Baroness Schauenburg ( name of enemy or ally of enemy), whose address is Friedburg, Baden, Germany (last known address), is an enemy (not holding a license granted by the President), and has a certain right, title, and interest in and to 12 shares of preferred (common, preferred) stock standing on your books in the name of Albertine, Baroness Schauenburg.\n\n'I, as Alien Property Custodian, do hereby require that you shall convey, transfer, assign, and deliver to me as Alien Property Custodian, to be by me held, administered, and accounted for as provided by law, every right, title, and interest of the said enemy in said stock, including in respect to the said stock the right which the said enemy may have, (a) to receive all notices issued by you \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n to the holders or owners of similar stock, shares, or certificates; ( b) to exercise all voting power appertaining to such stock, shares, or certificates; (c) to receive all subscription rights, dividends, and other distributions and payments, whether of capital or of income, declared or made on account of such stock, shares, or certificates.\n\n'I, as Alien Property Custodian, do hereby further require that you note the substance of this demand upon your stock books and\/or stock ledger, and that you furnish a copy of this demand to the registrar and\/or transfer agent, if any, of the stock in respect to which this demand is made.\n\n'I, as Alien Property Custodian, do hereby further require that within ten days from the service of this demand upon you, you report to me any and all acts which you have done, or omitted to do, pursuant to the requirements of this demand.\n\n'Until otherwise directed, you will remit to the Alien Property Custodian at Washington, by check payable to his order, all payments, whether of capital or income, now or hereafter declared or due on account of such stock, shares, or certificates, and you will direct such notices in respect to the said stock, shares, or certificates to the Alien Property Custodian.\n\n'This demand is supplementary to any demand which may hitherto have been made upon you, accompanied by the presentation of certificates which represent shares or beneficial interests, for the transfer into my name as Alien Property Custodian, of such certificates, or for the transfer thereof into the name of any nominee of me as Alien Property Custodian, and this demand shall not prejudice or affect any demand accompanied by such certificates which has been, or which may hereafter be, made.'\n\n The Custodian admitted that, during the war, there was no request specifically for the cancellation of the old \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n certificates and the issue of new ones. He contended that the President determined, as set forth in the original demand, that the persons in whose names the shares were registered, or those for whom the shares were held, were enemies not licensed, each having a certain right, title, and interest in and to the specific shares; that, by the demand, he duly seized these shares and the alien's interest therein; that thereby the Custodian secured legally a control over the shares as complete and effective as the control given the Custodian over chattels physically seized; that this is true, although prior to the Act of November 4, 1918, c. 201,  1 (40 Stat. 1020), Congress had not provided any method for enforcing the issue of new certificates without surrender of the old; that, when the Trading with the Enemy Act was so amended, he became entitled to have new certificates for the shares delivered to him without the presentation or surrender of the old ones; that, having thereafter duly requested their issue and delivery to him, he was entitled to the relief prayed for.\n The companies admitted that, after the war and before institution of the suit, there was a request, appropriate in form. They denied that the determinations and the demands made during the war were duly made. But their defense was rested mainly on the claim that the corpus of the shares, as distinguished from an undefined interest therein, was not seized or demanded during the war. They contend that by the original demand the President determined only that the enemy had some interest; that the instrument did not constitute a symbolic seizure of the shares; and hence that it did not create such a right as could serve as a basis for compelling their transfer to the Custodian, or the cancellation of the old certificates and the issue of the new ones. They insist that the determination of some interest is not equivalent to determining that the shares belong to or are held for the enemy; that any interest held by the enemy, however \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n remote or contingent, might satisfy such a determination and yet the shares in fact belong to and be held for another, not an enemy; that a demand upon the corporation to assign such an undefined interest is not a demand that the shares themselves be transferred; and that this interpretation of the document is supported by the fact that the Custodian made, at the time, no effort to obtain a new certificate, and in fact expressly indicated that he was not making any such effort. The companies' further contention is that, as applied to the facts stipulated, the act as amended did not purport to require cancellation of the old and delivery of new certificates, and that, if it did, it denied due process, and hence was void under the Fifth Amendment.\n It may be assumed that under section 7 recovery by the Custodian of property demanded by him is limited by the scope of the demand. Compare Sutherland v. Guaranty Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 11 F. (2d) 696; and that the demand made after the war, if it stood alone, would not avail the Custodian. Compare Miller v. Rouse (D. C.) 276 F. 715, 717.\n First. The main question is whether the Custodian had, by the demand above set forth, taken action which could legally serve as a basis for the specific request for the certificates made after the war. The demand must be read in the light of the then existing legislation, of its formal title or designation, of the extracts of the Executive Order embodied in it, and of the reports of the Great Northern out of which it originated. And these reports must be read in the light of the fact that stock is presumed to be owned by the registered owner, and that, where stock is stated to be held by the registered owner for another named person, the latter is presumed to own the whole beneficial interest. Compare Turnbull v. Payson, \n95 U.S. 418\n, 421; Keyser v. Hitz, \n133 \nU.S. 138, 149\n, 10 S. Ct. 290; Finn v. Brown, \n142 \nU.S. 56, 67\n, 12 S. Ct. 136. \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n The omission from the demand of the request for a new certificate is susceptible of a simple explanation. At the times of the earlier demands, section 12 of the act, as amended by Act March 28, 1918, c. 28,  1, 40 Stat. 423, 460, made it the duty of corporations to transfer seized shares upon its 'books into the name of the Alien Property Custodian' only if his demand was 'accompanied by the presentation of the certificates which represent such shares.' The Custodian was unable to present the old certificates. Consequently a request for the new certificates would not have been inserted in the demand, even if the instrument had contained an express recital of the determination that the enemy owned the whole interest in the shares and that the whole interest had been seized. It was not until the amendment of November 4, 1918, that the corporation was required to cancel the old certificates and issue the new ones, whenever enemy property consisted of-\n'shares of stock or other beneficial interest ... standing upon its ... books in the name of any person ... or held ... for the benefit of any person ... who shall have been determined by the President, after investigation, to be an enemy ... and which shall have been required to be conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him. ...' 40 Stat. 1021\n\n\n\n It is true that the demands for some of the shares were not made until after November 4, 1918, and that in them the request for the new certificates might have been made. But, in view of war conditions, it is not surprising that the modification of the form in use was not promptly made, and that the old form continued in use.\n The form used indicated clearly, in parts other than that quoted above, the intention to seize the whole property. It was entitled:\n'Demand on Corporation for Stockholders' Interest without Presentation of Certificates. Demand by Alien Property Custodian for Property.' \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n Preceding that part of the document addressed specifically to the Great Northern quoted above, were printed the following 'Extracts from Executive Order of February 26, 1918':\n\n Section 1(c): 'The words 'right,' 'title,' 'interest,' 'estate,' 'power,' and 'authority' of the enemy, as used herein, shall be deemed to mean respectively such right, title, interest, estate, power, and authority of the enemy as may actually exist and also such as might or would exist if the existing state of war had not occurred, and shall be deemed to include respectively the right, title, interest, estate, power, and authority in law or equity or otherwise of any representative of or trustee for the enemy or other person claiming under or in the right, of, or for the benefit of, the enemy.'\n Section 2(a): 'A demand for the conveyance, transfer, assignment, delivery, and payment of money or other property, unless expressly qualified or limited, shall be deemed to include every right, title, interest, and estate of the enemy in and to the money or other property demanded as well as every power and authority of the enemy thereover.'\n Section 2(c): 'When demand shall be made and notice thereof given, as hereinbefore provided, such demand and notice shall forthwith vest in the Alien Property Custodian such right, title, interest, and estate in and to and possession of the money or other property demanded and such power or authority thereover as may be included within the demand, and the Alien Property Custodian may thereupon proceed to administer such money and other property in accordance with the provisions of the 'Trading with the Enemy Act' and with any order, rules, or regulations heretofore, hereby, or hereafter made by me or heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian.'\n Section 3(d): 'The Alien Property Custodian may exercise any right, power, or authority of the enemy in, to, \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 191]\n\u00a0\n and over corporate stock, shares, or certificates representing beneficial interests owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of or for the benefit of an enemy, including ( 1) the right to receive all notices issued by the corporation, unincorporated association, company, or trustee which issued such stock, shares, or certificates, to the holders or owners of similar stock, shares, or certificates, (2) the right to exercise all voting power appertaining to such stock, shares, or certificates, and (3) the right to receive all subscription rights, dividends, and other distributions and payments, whether of capital or income, declared or made on account of such stock, shares, or certificates, regardless of whether or not such stock, shares, or certificates be in the possession of the Alien Property Custodian and regardless of whether or not such stock, shares, or certificates have been transferred to the Alien Property Custodian upon the books of the corporation, association, company, or trustee issuing the same.'\n Following the provisions of section 3(d) of the Executive Order, the Custodian enumerated in its demand upon the Great Northern substantially every right which the sole owner of shares could exercise, except the right to receive a certificate representing the stock and the right to dispose of the same. His request should be construed as a demand for delivery of the shares, because it extended to everything which the legislation permitted prior to the amendment of November 4, 1918. The Custodian sought possession, not title. Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 566\n, 569 S., 41 S. Ct. 214. The term seizure as used in this connection connotes merely the taking of possession. Hence there was no occasion to define the extent of the enemy's ownership. The demand operated as a symbolic seizure.\n The claim of the Custodian to have the new certificates does not rest, as has been argued, upon post-war action \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 192]\n\u00a0\n taken by him; or upon a construction of the Joint Resolution of July 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 105), officially declaring the war at an end; or upon any provision of the Treaties of Peace, Auguest 24, 1921, 42 Stat. 1946; August 25, 1921, 42 Stat. 1939. The Custodian's claim and the decree rest wholly upon the demands made during the war. Since the Custodian's possession of the shares was completed before the end of the war, it is immaterial that the demand for new certificates was not made until after the war. The Act of November 4, 1918, had made it the duty of the corporation to cancel the old certificates and to issue new ones, whenever the Custodian had seized shares. Section 5 of the Joint Resolution of July 2, 1921, reserved to the Custodian all property which before that date had come under his control.\n The seizures made before November 4, 1918 were equally effective with those made after. It is urged that so to hold gives retroactive effect to the amendment of that date. But this is not true. The amendment does not enlarge the scope of the seizure. No substantive right is thereby affected. The amendment confers merely the adjective right to require of the corporation delivery of the usual evidence of effective possession of shares. The right conferred is comparable to providing a new judicial remedy for an existing substantive right. As was said in Cox v. Hart, \n260 \nU.S. 427, 435\n, 43 S. Ct. 154:\n'A statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.'\n\n Second. The companies contend that, even after the amendment of November 4, 1918, the act did not purport to confer upon the Custodian the power to demand new certificates without surrender of the old. As seen above, section 12 of the original act (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 ff) made it the duty of the corporation to transfer shares or certificates into the Custodian's name only if the old certificates were surrendered. It is \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 193]\n\u00a0\n true that this condition was never in terms removed from that section. But it was necessarily removed when the Act of November 4, 1918, amended section 7(c) by requiring the corporation to issue new certificates whenever the Custodian had demanded the shares of alien enemies. See Garvan v. Marconi Co. (D. C.) 275 F. 486; Garvan v. Certain Shares of International Agricultural Corp. (D. C.) 276 F. 206; Columbia Brewing Co. v. Miller (C. C. A.) 281 F. 289; Miller v. Kaliwerke Aschersleben Aktien- Gesellschaft (C. C. A.) 283 F. 746.\n Third. The companies contend that the act, so construed and applied, deprives them of due process, since it confers upon the Custodian rights not possessed even by the owners of the shares. It is urged that the owners of stock in the Great Northern took it subject to the provision inserted in the certificate that it is 'transferable only on the books of the company in person or by attorney upon surrender of this certificate'; that the Great Northern's by-laws provide that its shares 'shall be transferred only on the books of the company by the holder thereof in person or by his attorney upon surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares'; that these conditions were imposed by it under its charter, a special act of the Legislature of Minnesota; and that they constitute property attributes inhering in the shares and in the stock certificates which are evidences thereof; that the Great Northern shares are listed upon the New York Stock Exchange and the company maintains in New York on office for transferring certificates of its stocks; that section 178 of the Personal Property Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 41) provides that, except where a certificate is lost or destroyed, the corporation shall not be compelled to issue a new certificate until the old certificate is surrendered to it; and that the Central Union, registrar of Great Northern stock, is under agreement with the New York \n\n[273 U.S. 182, 194]\n\u00a0\n Stock Exchange, whereunder such registrar, as a condition of being accepted by the New York Stock Exchange, is obligated not to register the transfer of certificates of Great Northern without surrender of the certificates outstanding therefor.\n The decisions of this court and provisions made in the act dispose of this contention. Protection to the rights of owners other than enemies was provided for by section 9 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 e). Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 246 S., 41 S. Ct. 293; Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 567\n, 569 S., 41 S. Ct. 214. Neither the railway nor the registrar has any interest in the shares. They are protected in making delivery of the new certificates by section 7(e) of the act which provides:\n'No person shall be held liable in any court for or in respect to anything done or omitted in pursuance of any order, rule, or regulation made by the President under the authority of this act.\n\n'Any payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery of money or property made to the alien property custodian hereunder shall be a full acquittance and discharge for all purpose of the obligation of the person making the same to the extent of same.'\n\n The requirement that the company make complete delivery to the Custodian of the possession of the shares including the usual indicia was well within the war powers of Congress.

The point for consideration is whether the trial court charged the jury concerning estimation of damages according to the rule approved by this court.\n The cause went to the jury upon special issues framed as questions. Answers thereto constitute the verdict. Relevant parts of special issue No. 7 follow:\n'Regardless of what your answers may be to the questions submitted in this charge, you will assess damages, and you will arrive at the amount thereof by assessing the same at such sum of money as if paid in cash at this time would be sufficient to fairly compensate the surviving wife and child for such actual pecuniary loss as you may believe from the evidence that they had a reasonable expectation of receiving from said John H. Moser, if any, from and after the death of the said John H. Moser, if he had not died on the date alleged. By pecuniary loss is meant such loss as may be compensated for in money. In answering special issue No. 7, you will take into consideration the contribution of money and other pecuniary benefits, if any, which the evidence may show that said surviving wife and child would have received from him after the time of his death, if he had continued to live. ... In assessing the damages, if any, you will confine yourselves solely to the determination of the pecuniary and monetary interest, if any, that the plaintiff and her child had in the continued life of deceased. ...\n\n'Bearing in mind the foregoing definitions and instructions on the measure of damages, you will answer special issue No. seven. What amount of money, if paid now, will fairly and reasonably compensate the surviving widow and child of the deceased, John H. Moser, for the actual pecuniary loss which they respectively suffered by reason of his \n\n[275 U.S. 133, 135]\n\u00a0\n death, if any? This question you will answer by stating the aggregate amount of such pecuniary loss or damage, and you will answer in the space below the amount you find from the evidence.'\n\n Petitioner seasonably objected to the charge as-\n'generally too broad and not definite and specific enough and the jury should be limited in their consideration of the measure of damages, and the damages to be awarded, and should be further and more in detail instructed as to matters they can consider and the way their verdict should be arrived at more fully shown and in line with defendant's requested charges on the issue of damages.'\n\n Also to special issue No. 7 because-\n'it does not give the jury any rule or formula by which the jury may determine the amount of money that if paid now will fairly and reasonably compensate the surviving widow and child for the actual pecuniary loss.'\n\n And it requested the following special instruction:\n'In considering of your verdict on the question of damages, and under the special issues submitted to you in that connection, and thereunder in determining 'such sum of money as if paid in cash at this time would be sufficient to fairly compensate the surviving wife and child,' for their pecuniary loss, you are instructed that in determining the present value of such contributions as plaintiff would probably have received from the continued life of the deceased you will make your calculations on the basis of the amount of your award, bearing interest at the highest net rate of interest that the testimony shows can be had on money safely invested, and secured as shown by the testimony in this case.'\n\n This action sufficed to raise the point now presented. Refusal to grant the request was material error.\n Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Kelly, Admx., \n241 \nU.S. 485, 491\n, 36 S. Ct. 630, and Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v.

It should be accepted and followed.\n The judgment below is reversed, and the cause will be remanded to the Court of Civil Appeals, Third Supreme Judicial District, state of Texas, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGYPSY OIL CO. v.

Hupper, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 207, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Oil Transport Company, the owner of wooden oil tank barge Bolikow, filed a libel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the Southern Pacific Company, alleging that the Bolikow, made fast to a dock in the harbor of the city of Galveston, was laden with a cargo of crude oil, from which a large part had been discharged; that an explosion took place in one of her tanks, causing fire; that the El Occidente, a steamer of the Southern Pacific Company, was injured by the fire; that the value of the barge after the explosion and fire was $250, and her pending freight at the time did not exceed $11,076.85; that the damage to the Occidente was due, not to the Bolikow, but to her own negligent management and the lack of power of the tug which attempted to take her to a safe place; that the claims of the owners of the Occidente were in excess of $484,000, and there were claims by persons on the barge for death and injuries from the fire, amounting to $ 50,000 in one case and $15,000 in another. The owner contested his liability and that of its barge, Bolikow, to any extent whatever, but, in case its liability was established, claimed and sought the benefit of the statutory limitation of its liability. Rev. St.  4283, 4284, and 4285 ( Comp. St.  8021, 8022, 8023).\n Pursuant to the court's order, the National Oil Transport Company, as principal, and the Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company, as surety, executed an ad interim stipulation that the former, as principal, and the latter, as surety, undertook in the sum of $11,326.85, with interest, that the transport company would file a bond or stipulation for the limitation of its liability as owner of the barge Bolikow, exe- \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 212]\n\u00a0\n cuted in due form of law for the value of the transport company's interest in the barge and her pending freight, with 6 per cent. interest thereon from December 23, 1920, within 10 days after such values were determined by appropriate proceedings in the court, and an order fixing such value was entered therein, and that, pending the filing of the formal stipulation, the ad interim undertaking should stand as security for all claims in the proceeding.\n The court then made an order directing the issuing of a monition to claimants against the vessel and her owner, growing out of the explosion, and an injunction. Without further action as to fixing the value of the barge or its pending freight, the claimants came in, the cause proceeded to a final decree, after a report by a commissioner, the petition for limitation of liability was denied, the claims in whole or in part were allowed, and the decree proceeded:\n'And it further appearing to the court that neither the petitioner nor its stipulator nor any other party or interest, has moved for or caused any reappraisal or appraisal of the petitioner's interest in said barge and her pending freight, or either of them, or caused any order to be entered by the court fixing such value, except as was done by the approval and filing of said ad interim stipulation as aforesaid, and the issuance and publication of a monition thereon as aforesaid, and it further appearing to the court that no bond for value other than said ad interim stipulation has been filed herein by the petitioner, and it appearing from the evidence introduced on the trial hereof, and the court here and now finding that the value of the petitioner's interest in said barge at the termination of her voyage is $250, and that the value of the petitioner's interest in the \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 213]\n\u00a0\n pending freight of said barge at the termination of said voyage is $ 11,076.85, and that the total value of said petitioner's interest in said barge and her pending freight at the termination of her said voyage is $11,326.85: It is therefore ordered and decreed that, unless this decree be satisfied or an appeal be taken therefrom within the time limited by law and the rules and practice of this court, the stipulator for value will cause the said petitioner to pay into court the sum of $11,326.85, the amount of the value of the petitioner's interest in the said barge and pending freight at the termination of her said voyage, with 6 per cent. interest from December 23, 1920, to be applied in payment of the costs of court, the remainder to be pro rated among the respective claimant respondents in proportion to the amounts of the decrees entered in their favor herein, or show cause why execution should not issue therefor, against goods, chattels, and lands of the stipulator for value.'\n\n The Hartford Indemnity Company, the stipulator, appealed from this decree, which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 3 F.(2d) 923. We brought the case here by certiorari. \n267 \nU.S. 590\n, 45 S. Ct. 462.\n The contention of the petitioner is that it could become liable only in the event limitation of liability was granted, and, as that relief was denied, the stipulation ceased to be effective; that upon a denial of a limitation of liability there ceased to be a res in court, that the proceeding was no longer one in rem, and that suits for the claims against the shipowner must be conducted in a court having jurisdiction on other grounds.\n It is surprising that no case has ever arisen in which the question here mooted has been directly decided, though the effect of a decision refusing limitation has been the subject of discussion in The Titanic (D. C.) 204 F 295, and in The Virginia (D. C.) 266 F. 437, 439. See also, Dowdell v. U. S. District Court (C. C. A.) 139 F. 444; In re Jeremiah Smith & Sons (C. C. A.) 193 F. 395; The Santa Rosa (D.

St.  8020-8025), are shown in a series of cases in this court, the chief of which is Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104. Further consideration to this subject was given by the court in The Benefactor, \n103 U.S. 239\n; in Providence & New York Steamship Co. v. Hill Manufacturing Co., \n109 \nU.S. 578\n, 3 S.

Ct. 133; and in La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95\n, 28 S. Ct. 664.\n These decisions establish, first, that the great object of the statute was to encourage shipbuilding and to induce the investment of money in this branch of industry by limiting the venture of those who build the ships to the loss of the ship itself or her freight then pending, in cases of damage or wrong happening, without the privity, or knowledge of the shipowner, and by the fault or neglect of the master or other persons on board; that the origin of this proceeding for limitation of liability is to be found in the general maritime law differing from the English maritime law; and that such a proceeding is entirely within the constitutional grant of power to Congress to establish courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction (Norwich v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104); that to effect the purpose of the statute, admiralty rules Nos. 54, 55, 56, and 57 were adopted, by which the owner may institute a proceeding in a United States District Court in admiralty against one claiming damages for the loss, in which he may, deny any liability for himself or his vessel, but may ask that, if the vessel is found at fault, his liability as owner shall be limited to the value of the vessel as appraised after the occurrence of the loss and the pending freight for the voyage; that these damages shall include damages to \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 215]\n\u00a0\n goods on board; second, damages by collision to other vessels and their chargoes; and, third, any other damage or forfeiture done or incurred; that all others having similar claims against the vessel and the owner may be brought into concourse in the proceeding by monition, and enjoined from suing the owner and vessel on such claims in any other court; that the proceeding is equitable in its nature, and is to be likened to a bill to enjoin multiplicity of suit (Providence Steamship Co. v. Hill Manufacturing Co., \n109 \nU.S. 578\n, 3 S. Ct. 379); that by stipulation after appraisement the vessel and freight may be released, and the stipulation be substituted therefor; that on reference to a commissioner and the coming in of his report, it shall be determined, first, whether the owner and his vessel are liable at all; second, whether the owner may avoid all liability except that of the vessel and pending freight; third, what the amount of the just claims are; and, fourth, how the fund in court should be divided between the claimants. The cases show that the court may enter judgment in personam against the owner as well as judgment in rem against the res, or the substituted fund (City of Norwich, \n118 \nU.S. 468, 503\n, 6 S. Ct. 1150); that the fund is to be distributed to all established claims to share in the fund to which admiralty does not deny existence, whether they be liens in admiralty or not (The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 406\n, 28 S. Ct. 133); and that they may include damages from a collision, from personal injuries ( Butler v. Boston Steamship Co., \n130 U.S. 527\n, S. Ct. 612), or for wrongful death if arising under a law of Congress, a state of the Union, or a foreign state, which is applicable to the owner and the vessel ( The Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95, 138\n, 28 S. Ct. 664).\n It is quite evident from these cases that this court has by its rules and decisions given the statute a very broad and equitable construction for the purpose of carrying out its purpose, and for facilitating a settlement of the whole controversy over such losses as are comprehended within \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 216]\n\u00a0\n it, and that all the ease with which rights can be adjusted in equity is intended to be given to the proceeding. It is the administration of equity in an admiralty court. Dowdell v. United States District Judge (C. C. A.) 139 F. 444, 445. The proceeding partakes in a way of the features of a bill to enjoin the multipicity of suits, a bill in the nature of an interpleader, and a creditor's bill. It looks to a complete and just disposition of a many-cornered controversy, and is applicable to proceedings in rem against the ship, as well as to proceedings in personam against the owner; the limitation extending to the owner's property as well as to his person. The City of Norwich, \n118 \nU.S. 468, 503\n, 6 S. Ct. 1150.\n With this general view of the statute, we come to the contention of the petitioner in this case. He says that owner only brings the suit to limit his liability, if it exists, to the vessel and the freight for the voyage. If he fails in his purpose, and does not establish the limitation, no progress can be made in behalf of the defendant or the claimants in the collection of what has been found due them, and, because he has lost that feature of his suit against them, the case must be dismissed. This is said to follow, even though it is apparent that, by virtue of the owner's suit and the injunction he secured, he has delayed and prevented his creditors from resorting to any other forum to vindicate their rights against him. In this view the defendant and the claimants thus may not thereafter share in the fund or res, the deposit of which, for the benefit of the defendants and the claimants, was the principal ground and the indispensable condition of the proceeding. The parties, it is argued, must thereafter be remitted to a commonlaw or equity court of the state to secure their rights, unless diverse citizenship or the admiralty character of their claims entitles them to resort to, or remain in, a federal court.\n Surely the admiralty court, in view of the large powers intended to be given it in such a proceeding, is not so help \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 217]\n\u00a0\n less as this. So to hold would be to hold that, unless the petitioner wins, the court does not have power to administer justice. There is nothing in the statute nor in the rules that requires so feeble a conclusion. The jurisdiction of the admiralty court attaches in rem and in personam by reason of the custody of the res put by the petitioner into its hands. The court of admiralty, in working out its jurisdiction, acquires the right to marshal all claims, whether of strictly admiralty origin or not, and to give effect to them by the apportionment of the res and by judgment in personam against the owners, so far as the court may decree. It would be most inequitable if parties and claimants brought in against their will, and prevented from establishing their claims in other courts, should be unable to perfect a remedy in this proceeding promptly, and should be delayed, until after the possible insolvency of the petitioner, to seek a complete remedy in another court, solely because the owner cannot make his case of personal immunity. Bene dict's Admiralty (5th Ed.) 488. If Congress has constitutional power to gather into the admiralty court all claimants against the vessel and its owner, whether their claims are strictly in admiralty or not, as this court has clearly held, it necessarily follows, as incidental to that power, that it may furnish a complete remedy for the satisfaction of those claims by distribution of the res, and by judgments in personam for deficiencies against the owner, if not released by virtue of the statute.\n Such a conclusion is quite in accord with the rules governing equity procedure, in general conformity with which this limitation of liability statute has been construed and enforced. Where a court of equity has obtained jurisdiction over some portion of a controversy, it may, and will in general, proceed to decide the whole issues and award complete relief, even where the rights of parties are strictly legal, and the final remedy granted is of the kind \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 218]\n\u00a0\n which might be conferred by a court of law. Pomeroy's Equity Jurisdiction ( 4th Ed.)  181 and 231; United States v. Union Pacific Railway Company, \n160 \nU.S. 1, 52\n, 16 S. Ct. 190. See, also, equity rule 10, amended May 4, 1925, \n268 U.S. 709\n, appendix. Of course, this equitable rule enlarging the chancellor's jurisdiction, in order completely to dispose of the cause before him, does not usually apply in an admiralty suit. Grant v. Poillon, 20 How. (U. S.) 162; Turner v. Beacham, Taney, 583, Fed. Cas. No. 14,252; The Pennsylvania (C. C. A.) 154 F. 9; The Ada (C. C. A.) 250 F. 194. But this limitation of liability proceeding differs from the ordinary admiralty suit, in that, by reason of the statute and rules, the court of admiralty has power (Providence Steamship Co. v. Hill Manufacturing Co., \n109 \nU.S. 578\n, 3 S. Ct. 379) to do what is exceptional in a court of admiralty-to grant an injunction, and by such injunction bring litigants, who do not have claims which are strictly admiralty claims, into the admiralty court (Benedict on Admiralty (5th Ed.)  70, note 97). There necessarily inheres, therefore, in the character of the limitation of liability proceeding in reference to such nonadmiralty claims, the jurisdiction to fulfill the obligation to do equitable justice to such claimants by furnishing them a complete remedy.\n The indemnity company seeks in this review to avoid its liability under an ad interim stipulation having a provision that such stipulation, if not changed to a formal stipulation, shall stand as security for all claims in the limitation proceeding. The stipulation is a substitute for the vessel itself and the freight, which was released by reason thereof. The effect of such a stipulation in admiralty is set forth by Mr. Justice Story in The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 10, where he says:\n'Whenever a stipulation is taken in an admiralty suit, for the property subjected to legal process and condemnation, the stipulation is deemed a mere substitute for the thing itself, and the stipulators liable to the exercise of \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 219]\n\u00a0\n all those authorities on the part of the court, which it could properly exercise, if the thing itself were still in its custody. This is the known course of the admiralty. It is quite a different question whether the court will, in particular cases, exercise its authority, where sureties on the stipulation may be affected injuriously; that is a subject addressed to its sound discretion.'\n\n In The Oregon, \n158 \nU.S. 186, 209\n, 15 S. Ct. 804, 814 (39 L. Ed. 943), after reference to The Palmyra and an examination of the English authorities, it was held that the use of bail as a substitute for the property itself is confined to 'all points fairly in adjudication before the court.' In that case a stipulator for the release of a vessel libeled for a collision was held not to be responsible to interveners in the suit, intervening after the release of the vessel, in the absence of express agreement to that effect. In reversing the court below, this court said, through Mr. Justice Brown:\n'We think the court must have confounded a stipulation given to answer a particular libel with a stipulation for the appraised value of the vessel, under the limited liability act, which, by general admiralty rule 54, is given for payment of such value into court whenever the same shall be ordered, and in such case the court issues a monition against all persons claiming damages against the vessel, to appear and make due proof of their respective claims. And by rule 55, after such claims are proven and reported, 'the moneys paid, or secured to be paid into court as aforesaid, or the proceeds of said ship or vessel and freight ... shall be divided pro rata amongst the several claimants, in proportion to the amount of their respective claims.' By rule 57, if the ship has been already libeled and sold, the proceeds shall represent the same for the purpose of these rules. In all the case cited, in which it has been said that the stipulation is a substitute for the thing itself, the remark has been made either with reference to the particular suit in which the stipulation is given, or with reference to a stipulation for the appraised value of the ves- \n\n[273 U.S. 207, 220]\n\u00a0\n sel, where the stipulation stands as security for any claim which may be filed against her up to the amount of the stipulation.'\n\n It is quite evident from this that the stipulation under rule 54 et seq., is to be treated as a substitute for the vessel itself for all claims that may normally arise out of the character of litigation carried on under such rules. That litigation as we have seen may properly be carried to a complete settlement of all claims, without regard to whether the prayer for limitation of liability is denied or not. The stipulator must, therefore, pay in full on his undertaking to enable the court to pay the costs and make the pro rata distribution.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAYMAN v. CITY OF GALVESTON(1927)\nNo. 155\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. D. A. Simmons, of Austin, Tex., and Sewall Myer, of Houston, Tex., for appellant. \n\n[273 U.S. 414, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, a resident of Texas, an osteopathic physician, duly licensed to practice medicine in the state, brought suit in the district court for southern Texas against the city of Galveston, the board of commissioners of the city, and the members of the governing board of the John Sealy Hospital, maintained by the city, to enjoin the enforcement of any rule or regulation excluding appellant or other osteopathic physicians from practicing their profession in the hospital, and denying admission to patients who wish to be treated by appellant or other osteopathic physicians.\n The bill alleged that the state of Texas, acting through the board of regents of the State University, had leased land to appellee, the city of Galveston, on which it was maintaining a municipal hospital in accordance with the provisions of the lease. The lease, which is annexed to the bill of complaint and made part of it, stipulates that the state reserves the right of use of the operating amphitheater, the wards and grounds of the hospital, by the faculty of the Medical Department of the State University, for purposes of clinical instruction of medical students attending the University in Galveston, and reserves also the right for such purposes to control the treatment of all charity patients. The city undertakes to permit the use of the facilities of the hospital for such instruction. The lease further provides that the hospital shall be managed and controlled by a hospital board, which is given the exclusive right to prescribe rules and regulations for the management and conduct of the hospital and to control its internal government. It is alleged that appellees, the board of managers, have made regulations excluding appellant and other licensed osteopathic physicians from practicing in the hospital and excluding patients who desire to be treated by appellant or other osteopaths. The bill does not set up diversity of citizenship of the parties \n\n[273 U.S. 414, 416]\n\u00a0\n and the only ground of jurisdiction alleged is that the suit is one arising under the Constitution of the United States.\n On motion directed to the pleadings, the bill was dismissed for want of equity. The case comes here on direct appeal. Judicial Code,  238 ( Comp. St.  1215), before amended.\n The case as presented carries to the point of extreme attenuation the principle that action by state officials depriving a person of property is to be deemed the action of the state for the purpose of determining whether the deprivation is within the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendent. Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, \n227 \nU.S. 278\n, 33 S. Ct. 312; Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20, 35\n, 36 S., 28 S. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757. Appellant does not point to any law of the state denying his asserted constitutional right to practice medicine in the John Sealy Hospital. The bill did not set up that appellees purported to act under any statute of the state denying such right. Appellant in fact argues that the state Constitution and laws confer upon him the asserted right which is infringed by the action of the hospital board.\n But if it be assumed that the question presented is the same as though the state Legislature had enacted the regulation adopted by the hospital board, Waterworks Co. v. Owensboro, \n200 \nU.S. 38\n, 26 S. Ct. 249, appellant fails to suggest, and we fail to perceive, any substantial basis for asserting that rights guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment have been infringed. The bill does not allege that appellant is a citizen of the state or of the United States, and there does not appear to be any substantial basis for urging that the action of the board abridges any privileges or immunities of a citizen of the United States. The protection of the due process clause extends to persons who are noncitizens. But the only protection claimed here is that of appellant's privilege to practice his calling. However extensive that protection may be in other situations, it cannot, we think, be said that all licensed physicians \n\n[273 U.S. 414, 417]\n\u00a0\n have a constitutional right to practice their profession in a hospital maintained by a state or a political subdivision, the use of which is reserved for purposes of medical instruction. It is not incumbent on the state to maintain a hospital for the private practice of medicine. Compare Heim v. McCall, \n239 \nU.S. 175\n, 36 S. Ct. 78, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 287.\n But it is argued that, if some physicians are admitted to practice in the hospital, all must be, or there is a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Even assuming that the arbitrary exclusion of some physicians would have that legal consequence in the circumstances of this case, the selection complained of was based upon a classification not arbitrary or unreasonable on its face. Under the Texas Constitution and statutes, anyone who shall 'offer to treat any disease or disorder, mental or physical, or any physical deformity or injury by any system or method, or to effect cures thereof' is a physician and may be admitted to practice within the state. Article 16,  31, Texas Constitution; Complete Tex. Stat. 1920, arts. 5739, 5741, 5745. We cannot say that a regulation excluding from the conduct of a hospital the devotees of some of the numerous systems or methods of treating diseases authorized to practice in Texas, is unreasonable or arbitrary. In the management of a hospital, quite apart from its use for educational purposes, some choice in methods of treatment would seem inevitable, and a selection based upon a classification having some basis in the exercise of the judgment of the state board whose action is challenged is not a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Compare Collins v. Texas, \n223 \nU.S. 288\n, 32 S. Ct. 286; Watson v. Maryland, \n218 \nU.S. 173\n, 30 S. Ct. 644; Crane v. Johnson, \n242 \nU.S. 339\n, 37 S. Ct. 176, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 796; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11\n, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765.\n The validity of the action of the board under the Texas Constitution is also before us. Article 16,  31, of the Texas Constitution provides:\n\n\n[273 U.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n 'The Legislature may pass laws prescribing the qualification of practitioners of medicine in this state, and to punish persons for malpractice, but no preference shall ever be given by law to any schools of medicine.'\n The limitation of the provision is obviously directed to the qualifications of those to be admitted to the practice of their profession in the state and has nothing to do with the qualifications of those who are to be allowed to practice in a state hospital or to participate in an educational enterprise conducted by the state.

W. 1068\n\n\n The action of the board does not violate rights or immunities guaranteed by either the state or the federal Constitution.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEINER v. COLONIAL TRUST CO.(1927)\nNo. 219\nArgued: October 7, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Messers. R. C. Allen and I. J. Underwood, both of Tulsa, Okl., and Charles Alvin Jones and M. W. Acheson, Jr., both of Pittsburgh, Pa., and John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[275 U.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent's decedent procured an oil lease from the Tribal Council of the Osage Tribe of Indians covering land of the Tribe in Oklahoma. The lease was in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior and was approved by him. The lessor reserved as royalties an agreed percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of the oil produced, to be paid to the Superintendent of the Osage Indian Agency. On the net income derived by decedent from the sale of the oil between 1917 and 1921 there were assessed and collected income taxes aggregating more than $800,000. Respondent brought these suits in the District Court for Western Pennsylvania to recover the tax paid, on the theory that, as the interests of the Indians were concerned, Congress had not intended by the various revenue acts to tax the income derived from the exploitation of their lands by non-Indian lessees, and that it was thus impliedly exempt from the tax. Judgments of the District Court for respondent (Colonial Trust Co. v. Heiner, 12 F.(2d) 481) were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (17 F.(2d) 36), and the cases are here on certiorari, the parties having stipulated that No. 220 shall abide the result in No. 219.\n Section 1(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916, (Chapter 463, 39 Stat. 756 ( Comp. St.  6336a)) provides:\n'That there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the entire net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources by every individual, a citizen or resident of the United States, a tax ...' at specified rates.\n\n Section 2(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended by the act of 1917 (chapter 63, 40 Stat. 300, 329 (Comp St.  6336b)), provides:\n'That, subject only to such exemptions and deductions as are hereinafter allowed, the net income of a taxable person shall include gains ... growing out of the ... use of or interest in real or personal property, \n\n[275 U.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n also (gains) from ... the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.'\n\n The pertinent sections of the later revenue acts during the period do not differ materially from those quoted from the 1916 act. Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18,  210, 213, 40 Stat. 1057, 1062, 1065; Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 136,  210, 213, 42 Stat. 227, 233, 237 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 e, 6336 1\/8 ff).\n These statutes in terms plainly embrace the income of a non-Indian lessee derived from the lease of restricted Indian lands. But we are reminded by respondent that both the lease here involved and the income it brings the lessee are beyond the taxing power of the states, for the lease is merely the instrument which the government has chosen to use in fulfilling its task of developing to the fullest the lands and resources of its wards, and a state may not by taxation lessen the attractiveness of leases for such a purpose, Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171; Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S. Ct. 453. And see Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27; Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609\n, 46 S. Ct. 592. And reliance is placed on those cases indicating that general acts of Congress are not applicable to the Indians where to apply them would affect the Indians adversely. Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422, 427\n, 428 S., 35 S. Ct. 119; Elk v. Wilkins, \n112 \nU.S. 94, 100\n, 5 S. Ct. 41. The conclusion then urged on us is that Congress cannot be held to have intended by the general provisions of the revenue acts to tax the incomes of the Indians themselves, nor by taxing that of their lessees to do itself what the states are forbidden to do.\n The power of the United States to tax the income is undoubted. It seems to us extravagant, in the face of the comprehensive language of the statute, to infer that Congress did not intend to exercise that power merely \n\n[275 U.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n because, in the absence of congressional consent, it is one withheld from the states or because the tax in terms imposed on others may have some economic effect upon the Indians themselves. The disposition of Congress has been to extend the income tax as far as it can to all species of income, despite immunity from state taxation. During the period now in question the compensation of many federal officials was subject to federal income tax, and income from government bonds was taxed except when expressly exempted.\n Assuming that the Indians are not subject to the income tax, as contended, the fact that they are wards of the government is not a persuasive reason for inferring a purpose to exempt from taxation the income of others derived from their dealing with the Indians. Tax exemptions are never lightly to be inferred (Vicksburg, etc., R. R. v. Dennis, \n116 \nU.S. 665, 668\n, 6 S. Ct. 625; Philadelphia & Wilmington R. R. v. Maryland, 10 How. 376, 393), and we think any implication of an exemption of the income of the Indians themselves, if made, must rest on too narrow a basis to justify the inclusion of the income of other persons merely because the statute, if applied as written, may have some perceptible economic effect on the Indians.\n It is not without weight that the Treasury Department from the beginning has consistently collected income tax from lessees of Indian oil lands running into vast amounts. If this was contrary to the intention of Congress it is reasonable to suppose that this practice of the Department would have been specifically corrected in some of the revisions of the laws taxing income in 1917, 1919, 1921, 1924, or 1926.

Gen., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward J. White, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Missouri Pacific Railroad Company brought this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against Hellmich, United States collector of internal revenue, to recover taxes amounting to $14,792.95, paid by it under protest, for the transmission of telegraph messages from March, 1920, to January, 1923, inclusive. The messages in question were transmitted under the terms of a contract dated October 24, 1911, for the exchange of services between the Western Union Telegraph Company, on the one part, and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railroad Company, on the other part. To the rights and obligations of these two railway com- \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n panies, the respondent company, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, succeeded. The question of the legality of the taxes arises under two acts of Congress. The first is the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18 (40 Stat. 1057, 1101, 1102), which provides in its section 500:\n'That from and after April 1, 1919, there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid. in lieu of the taxes imposed by section 500 of the Revenue Act of 1917-\n\n'(f) In the case of each telegraph, telephone, cable or radio, dispatch, message, or conversation, which originates on or after such date within the United States, and for the transmission of which the charge is more than 14 cents and not more than 50 cents, a tax of 5 cents; and if the charge is more than 50 cents, a tax of 10 cents: Provided, that only one payment of such tax shall be required, notwithstanding the lines or stations of one or more persons are used for the transmission of such dispatch, message, or conversation. ...\n\n'Section 501(a). That the taxes imposed by Section 500 shall be paid by the person paying for the services or facilities rendered.' Comp. St.  6309 1\/3 a, 6309 1\/3 b.\n\n The second is the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136 (42 Stat. 227, 284) sections 500 and 501 of which (Comp. St.  6309 1\/3 a, 6309 1\/3 b) contain exactly the same language as that just quoted from the act of 1918\n\n\n The District Court held that the messages here in question came within these sections and gave judgment for the government. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court, holding that the telegraph messages up to the amount of $75,000 annually thus taxed were exempt, but that those in excess of that amount were subject to the tax.\n The point in the case is to determine whether these messages can be construed to be messages for the transmission of which there can be said to be a charge. The contention of the railroad company is that, in the sense \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n of this section 500, the mmssages in question are not charged for at all; that they cannot be fitted into the section, so that it cannot be construed to cover them. We must therefore consider the contract under which the messages for the railroad company were sent by the telegraph company. The contract was dated October 24, 1911, and is of indefinite duration. By its fourth paragraph the telegraph company agrees to perform, for the railway companies, telegraphic service between points on its lines in the United States, either on or off the lines of the railways covered by this agreement, as the railway companies may desire, for messages pertaining to their railroad business, under franks issued to their officers and agents, permitting all classes of messages and telegraphic letters in public use on the lines of the telegraph company. The railway companies agree to perform promptly such transportation and distribution service over their railroads as the telegraph company may require for its employees, supplies, and material, whether for work or use along the railroads or beyond or off their lines, and to furnish special trains, engines, crews, and equipment for distribution service, and outfit, boarding, and tool cars for work on their lines, whenever required by the telegraph company. The transportation of employees is to be authorized by passes to be issued by the railway companies on authorized request. The service performed by either party for the other is to be charged for at its regular current telegraph rates, or its through or local transportation rates, as the case may be, for the class of services rendered. Services performed by either party for the other for which there are no regular or published rates, and not otherwise provided for in this agreement, are to be charged for at actual cost, as determined by the officers of the party rendering the service, plus not exceeding 25 per cent. of such cost. At the close of each contracy year, bills are to be rendered by each party to the other for all services performed by \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n each party for the other during such year. If the bill therefor rendered by either party to the other exceeds the sum of $75,000 in any contract year, the party receiving such service is to pay to the party rendering the same the amount of such excess, provided that, in the event the services of both are in excess of $75,000 in any contract year, the party in arrears if to pay to the other party the difference between the rendered by each party to the other for such services in any contract year do not exceed $75,000, there is to be no payment by either party to the other therefor.\n By the fifth paragraph of the contract, it is provided that the telegraph or telephone opperators of the railway companies, at stations where the messages are less in number than 3,000 a year, are to act as the agents of the telegraph company and receive and transmit them, charging the tariff rates and rendering to the telegraph company monthly statements of the business, and are to pay the receipts therefor to the telegraph company, but the railway companies are not to be liable for receipts thus to be received and paid over. The railway operators and employees in such service are to conform to the rules and regulations of the telegraph company. They are not to transmit over the wires of either party any free messages, except those of the railway company's business. For messages transmitted for it by the employees of the railway company the telegraph company agrees to pay the railway companies 10 per cent. of the gross cash receipts, except on ocean cable messages, receipts for which are to be retained in full by the telegraph company.\n Pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Revenue Acts, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Treasury, promulgated article IX of Regulation No. 57 of the Treasury Department as to the proper construction of this section 500(f) of the act of 1918, as follows:\n\n\n[273 U.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n 'Messages Transmitted under Contract.-Where, by contract, a telegraph, telephone, radio, or cable company agrees, in consideration of the payment of a lump sum or of the performance of services, to transmit messages on frank, such messages are subject to the tax imposed by this section (500(f)) of the act. The tax on each such message is to be computed upon the amount of the regular established charge for the transmission of similar messages for ordinary customers, calculated at the regular fixed rate provided in the tariffs of the transmitting carrier. The questions as to whether such messages relate to the operation of the business of a common carrier and whether they are 'on line' or 'off line' are immaterial. Thus, a telegraph company agrees to transmit over its lines to a railroad line all messages relating to railroad business 'free' and all such messages over its line off the railroad lines 'free' to an amount not exceeding $10,000 per year calculated at its regular rates, and all messages over that amount at half rates, in consideration of services to be performed by the railroad in the transportation of men and materials of the telegraph company. All such messages, whether 'on line' or 'off line,' and whether 'free' or at half rates, are subject to the tax provided by this section (500(f)) of the act. The tax must be computed, collected, and paid upon each such message.'\n The case was heard upon a stipulation of facts, with some short additional testimony furnished by the officers of the railway company, as to the actual business transactions between the railway company and the telegraph company during the years in question.\n The evidence shows that, so far as the transportation of men and material was concerned, the railroad company kept a record of all transportation furnished to the telegraph company at tariff rates. At the end of the contract year, statements setting forth the transportation and the \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n charges were furnished to the Western Union. After they were verified by the Western Union they became the basis for settlement under the contract. A similar arrangement was made by the Western Union Telegraph company, as to the messages which it charged at its regular public rates.\n For the contract year ending August 31, 1920, the total amount of business handled by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company for the Western Union amounted to $80,721.72, or $5,721.72 in excess of the $75,000 allowance under the contract. During the same year the amount of business handled by the Western Union for the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company in telegraph messages was $71,815.17. That was $3,184.83 less than the amount provided for under the contract; and for that year there was no payment made by the Missouri Pacific to the Western Union Telegraph Company for such messages. For the year ending August 31, 1921, the net amount of business done by the railroad company in the way of transportation, etc., for the telegraph company was $144,023.95. This was $69,023.95 in excess of the $75,000. During the same year the business handled by the telegraph company in messages for the railroad company amounted to $86,221.92, or $ 11,221.92 in excess of the contract allowance. During that year the Western Union Telegraph Company paid the railroad company the difference between $69,023.95, and $11,221.92, or $57,802.03. For the year ending August 31, 1922, the net amount of business handled by the railroad company for the telegraph company in the way of transportation was $132, 349.02, or $57,349.02 in excess of the $75,000 limit, while the amount of business in messages handled by the telegraph company for the railroad company was $83.342.17, or $8,342.17 in excess of the same limit, and that year the telegraph company paid the railroad company the difference between $57,349.02 and $8,342.17, or $49,006.85. It further appeared that the taxes which accrued under \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n the construction imposed by the Commission of Internal Revenue from August, 1922 to January, 1923, were as follows:\n August, 1922 $ 647 62 September, 1922 604 55 October, 1922 885 30 November, 1922 797 25 December, 1922 937 80 January, 1923 883 60 ___ Total $4,756 10\n Upon these facts we think that the telegraph meassages were subject to the tax imposed by section 500 in each law. We think that the messages were charged for in the sense of that section, and that article IX of the Regulations No. 57 of the Treasury Department was a proper regulation to carry out the statute with reference to such a contract as this. The method adopted for the mutual charges was an agreement between the companies that up to a certain amount they were willing to run the risk that the compensation to be paid by each for the service of the other would not average more than the same sum. The contract was a contract for many years, the amount of the service on the one hand and on the other might vary from year to year, but year in and year out the two companies felt that $75,000 would be a safe sum for both. In exceptional years, if either had the advantage beyond $75,000, this should be made up for by the actual payment of cash for the excess of the party earning it.\n In argument, extreme instances for a single year were supposed such that as between the two contracting parties no transportation would be furnished, and so no compensation would be received by the telegraph company for the messages actually sent by it. Such a hypothesis is not a test of the actual equilateral character of the contract in its reciprocal obligations; $75,000, in the experience and judgment of the parties, measured the probable \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 252]\n\u00a0\n annual need of each for the service of the other. This was deemed a fair balance between the two, agreed upon for their mutual convenience of settlement. The contract was made long before the tax was imposed, and we must treat it as having been the result of transactions of previous years and justified by similiar experiences of other railroad and telegraph companies. Such contracts between railroads and telegraph lines were and are very frequent. Postal Telegraph & Cable Co. v. Tonopah Railroad Co., \n248 \nU.S. 471\n, 39 S. Ct. 162. The payment of charges for telegrams or shipments or other services was a mere substitute for the payment of the money down at the time each message was sent or each shipment made or other service was performed. Certainly no one would say that, because a patron of the telegraph company paid his bills once a year, it rendered them free from taxation. The arrangement here is not substantially different. The payment for the messages-i. e., the charge for them to satisfy the statute-should be for money or money's worth, and that is what we think this contract in its ultimate and general result amounted to.\n Some elaborate arguments have been made against this conclusion. The Circuit Court of Appeals' view was that this was a mere swapping of free privileges and was not a service for a money charge. We do not think the privileges were free. We think that the one for messages was set off against the one for transportation, and that the one paid for the other.\n The counsel for the respondent insist that our decision in Postal Telegraph & Cable Co. v. Tonopah & Tidewater Railroad Co., supra, is inconsistent with our present conclusion. That case concerned the right of telegraph companies to recover against railroad companies for telegraph messages on contracts like the one here in question. The defense was that such contracts for an exchange of service, while valid \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 253]\n\u00a0\n under the Interstate Commerce Law (24 Stat. 379) for messages and transportation on or along the line, were invalid as to messages or transportation service beyond the railway lines. The Interstate Commerce Commission had held that such extras must be charged for by the railroad upon the basis of its published rates, and by the telegraph company upon reasonable rates as charged to other customers for similar service. It arose under the amendment to Interstate Commerce Act June 18, 1910, c. 309 ,  7 (Comp. St.  8563), which, in bringing in under the Interstate Commerce Law telegraph and telephone and cable companies, provided 'that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent telephone, telegraph, and cable companies from entering into contracts with common carriers for the exchange of services.' It was held that this proviso was general enough to allow an exchange of services off the lines as well as services on them to be exchanged. The court said that the railroad and telegraph and grown together in mutual dependence, and that contracts of this sort for long terms had been nearly universal for 50 years; that, as it was feared that such contract would be unlawful if the telegraph companies were brought within the law, the amendment of 1910 was passed. This court's conclusion was that under the contract all the great benefits on one side were consideration for all those conferred upon the other, and that Congress probably allowed the exchange because it had been frequently advised by the Commission that full performance of the exchange would not affect any public or private interest adversely. Speaking of the meaning of exchange, the court said (p. 474 (39 S. Ct. 163)):\n'But 'exchange' is barter, and carries with it no implication of reduction to money as a common denominator. It contemplates simply an estimate, determined by self-interest, of the relative value and importance of the services rendered and those received. This is admitted with regard to services on the line, and if so whatever \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 254]\n\u00a0\n services can be exchanged can be exchanged in the same way.'\n\n This language is thought to show that the use of transportation service as a consideration for telegraphic messages could not properly be regarded as the equivalent of a money payment necessary to meet the requirement of section 500 as a basis of taxation. We do not think the case or the language quoted apposite. The court in the opinion cited was merely deciding what the general expression 'exchange of service' meant, and whether it must be narrowly, meticulously, and rigidly construed exactly to conform to the general rule that all rates of tariff on the same class of service should be uniform. The court was merely pointing out that, in allowing a general exchange of service between two such partners as a railroad and a telegraph company, Congress did not intend to enforce the uniformity rule strictly, and require a nice mathematical or monetary equivalence between the exchanged services. The issue here is different. It concerns a tax upon telegraph messages paid for by transportation and the question is whether such payment is a charge which can be measured, or measures itself, in money. The most significant evidence that it is appears in the conduct of the parties themselves, for in their exchange of such services they make actual payments to each other in money above a certain amount of business, which amount itself they determine by a carefully kept account of actual services in money figures.\n A lengthy argument is made that the Revenue Act and the Interstate Commerce Act are in pari materia, and therefore that the word 'charge' in the Revenue Act should be controlled by the meaning of the same word in interstate commerce legislation, which it is said it could not be satisfied by a mere exchange of service. We think this is a far cry to the proper meaning of section 500 in imposing a tax, and do not think its correct interpretation is thus assisted. \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 255]\n\u00a0\n Then it is said that paragraph (c) of section 501 of the act of 1918 ( Comp. St.  6903 1\/3 b) prevents the imposition of this tax. That paragraph is as follows:\n'(c) The taxes imposed by section 500 shall apply to all services or facilities specified in such section when rendered for hire whether or not the agency rendering them is a common carrier. In case a carrier (other than a pipe line) principally engaged in rendering transportation services or facilities for hire does not, because of its ownership of the goods transported, or for any other reason, receive the amount which as a carrier it would otherwise charge, such carrier shall pay a tax equivalent to the tax which would be imposed upon the transportation of such goods if the carrier received payment for such transportation, such tax, if it cannot be computed from actual rates or tariffs of the carrier, to be computed on the basis of the rates or tariffs of other carriers for like services as determined by the Commissioner. In the case of any carrier (other than a pipe line) the principal business of which is to transport goods belonging to it on its own account and which only incidentally renders services for hire, the tax shall apply to such services for facilities only as are actually rendered by it for hire. Nothing in this or the preceding section shall be construed as imposing a tax (1) upon the transportation of any commodity which is necessary for the use of the carrier in the conduct of its business as such and is intended to be so used or has been so used; or (2) upon the transportation of company material transported by one carrier, which constitutes a part of a railroad system, for another carrier which is also a part of the same system.'\n\n Regulation No. 49 issued by the Internal Revenue Department to carry out this paragraph, was as follows:\n'If a telegraph or telephone line or lines along the line of any railroad company be necessary for the use of such railroad company in the conduct of the railroad company's business as such, and if the railroad company, under con- \n\n[273 U.S. 242, 256]\n\u00a0\n tract transports commodities necessary to maintain or operate such telegraph or telephone line or lines along the line of such railroad company, such commodities being intended to be, or having been so used, and the railroad company makes no charge for such transportation, the charges which, but for such arrangement, would have accrued upon such transportation are exempt from the tax.'\n\n Paragraph (c) of section 501 is only to be found in the Revenue Act of 1918 and could not affect the validity of any taxes at issue in this case after August, 1922, when the Revenue Act of 1921 became applicable. In the next place, paragraph (c) with the enforcing regulation No. 49 has no application to the payment of taxes on telegraph messages. It is dealing with the transportation of goods and commodities by common carriers and the tax on rates received from their carriage. The words used make this interpretation necessary and it is supported by the fact that when in the Revenue Act of 1921 the taxes on freight and express shipments were repealed, this paragraph (c) was also repealed, though the tax on telegraph messages was retained.\n It is true that this result leaves a the telegraph messages in the exchange of services and exempts receipts on the transportation side of the exchange. But Congress did not fix its taxes with reference to the particular phase of this contract by which charges for messages are balanced against those for transportation, and doubtless had satisfactory reasons for exempting the one and not the other. The difference furnishes no ground for varying the meaning and scope of section 500(f) or its application to the telegrams which were exchanged for the exempted transportation.\n For the reasons given, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the District Court is restored. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHESS v.

Hall, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Harry J. Meleski, of Worcester, Mass., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by defendant in error to recover damages for personal injuries. The declaration alleged that plaintiff in error negligently and wantonly drove a motor vehicle on a public highway in Massachusetts, and that by reason thereof the vehicle struck and injured defendant in error. Plaintiff in error is a resident of Pennsylvania. No personal service was made on him, and no property belonging to him was attached. The service of process was made in compliance with chapter \n\n[274 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n 90, General Laws of Massachusetts, as amended by Stat. 1923, c. 431,  2, the material parts of which follow:\n'The acceptance by a nonresident of the rights and privileges conferred by section three or four, as evidence by his operating a motor vehicle thereunder, or the operation by a nonresident of a motor vehicle on a public way in the commonwealth other than under said sections, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the registrar or his successor in office, to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful processes in any action or proceeding against him, growing out of any accident or collision in which said nonresident may be involved while operating a motor vehicle on such a way, and said acceptance or operation shall be a signification of his agreement that any such process against him which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on him personally. Service of such process shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with a fee of two dollars in the hands of the registrar, or in his office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon the said nonresident: Provided, that notice of such service and a copy of the process are forthwith sent by registered mail by the plaintiff to the defendant, and the defendant's return receipt and the plaintiff's affidavit of compliance herewith are appended to the writ and entered with the declaration. The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.'\n\n Plaintiff in error appeared specially for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction, and filed an answer in abatement and moved to dismiss on the ground that the service of process, if sustained, would deprive him of his property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court overruled the answer in abatement and denied the motion. The Supreme Judicial \n\n[274 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n Court held the statute to be a valid exercise of the police power, and affirmed the order. Pawloski v. Hess, 250 Mass. 22, 144 N. E. 760, 35 A. L. R. 945. At the trial the contention was renewed and again denied. Plaintiff in error excepted. The jury returned a verdict for defendant in error. The exceptions were overruled by the Supreme Judicial Court. Pawloski v. Hess, 253 Mass. 478, 149 N. E. 122. Thereupon the superior court entered judgment. The writ of error was allowed by the Chief Justice of that court.\n The question is whether the Massachusetts enactment contravenes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The process of a court of one state cannot run into another and summon a party there domiciled to respond to proceedings against him. Notice sent outside the state to a nonresident is unavailing to give jurisdiction in an action against him personally for money recovery. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 741\n. There must be actual service within the state of notice upon him or upon some one authorized to accept service for him. Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 \nU.S. 518\n, 15 S. Ct. 559. A personal judgment rendered against a nonresident, who has neither been served with process nor appeared in the suit, is without validity. McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 \nU.S. 90\n, 37 S. Ct. 343, L. R. A. 1917F, 458. The mere transaction of business in a state by nonresident natural persons does not imply consent to be bound by the process of its courts. Flexner v. Farson, \n248 \nU.S. 289\n, 39 S. Ct. 97. The power of a state to exclude foreign corporations, although not absolute, but qualified, is the ground on which such an implication is supported as to them. Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co., \n243 \nU.S. 93, 96\n, 37 S. Ct. 344. But a state may not withhold from nonresident individuals the right of doing business therein. The privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution (section 2, art. 4), safeguards to the citizens of one state the right 'to pass through, or to reside in any other state for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise.' \n\n[274 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n And it prohibits state legislation discriminating against citizens of other states. Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 371, 381. Fed. Cas. No. 3, 230; Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180.\n Motor vehicles are dangerous machines, and, even when skillfully and carefully operated, their use is attended by serious dangers to persons and property. In the public interest the state may make and enforce regulations reasonable calculated to promote care on the part of all, residents and nonresidents alike, who use its highways. The measure in question operates to require a nonresident to answer for his conduct in the state where arise causes of action alleged against him, as well as to provide for a claimant a convenient method by which he may sue to enforce his rights. Under the statute the implied consent is limited to proceedings growing out of accidents or collisions on a highway in which the nonresident may be involved. It is required that he shall actually receive and receipt for notice of the service and a copy of the process. And it contemplates such continuances as may be found necessary to give reasonable time and opportunity for defense. It makes no hostile discrimination against nonresidents, but tends to put them on the same footing as residents. Literal and precise equality in respect of this matter is not attainable; it is not required. Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Eggen, \n252 \nU.S. 553, 561\n, 562 S., 40 S. Ct. 402.

And, in advance of the operation of a motor vehicle on its highway by a nonresident, the state may require him to appoint one of its officials as his agent on whom process may be served in proceedings growing out of such use. Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30. That case recognized power of the state to exclude a nonresident until the formal appointment is made. And, having the power so to exclude, the state \n\n[274 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n may declare that the use of the highway by the nonresident is the equivalent of the appointment of the registrar as agent on whom process may be served. Cf. Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co ., supra, 96 (37 S. Ct. 344); Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407, 408.

FEDERAL OIL & DEVELOPMENT CO.(1927)\nNo. 166\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 15, 16]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James M. Hodgson and Floyd E. Pendell, both of Denver, Colo., for appellant.\n Messrs. Harold D. Roberts, of Denver, Colo., Tyson S. Dynes, of Chicago, Ill., and Peter H. Holme, of Denver, Colo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant seeks to establish his right to a one-eighth interest in an oil and gas lease upon 160 acres of land in Wyoming granted August 21, 1920, by the United States to appellee Federal Oil & Development Company under section 18, Act of Congress approved February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437, 443 (Comp. St.  4640 1\/4 i). The lease was afterwards assigned to the Mountain & Gulf Oil Company upon conditions not here important.\n The bill, filed May 26, 1922, proceeds upon the theory:\n That January 11, 1887, George McManus and seven associates located a placer mining claim-the O'Glase-and thereafter perfected the same. McManus died in 1901. His one-eighth interest descended to his heirs and has never been forfeited, abandoned, or lost. These heirs lived beyond Wyoming and were unaware of their interest in the claim for 20 years. The land is within the district withdrawn from entry by executive order of September 27, 1909. The Federal Oil & Development Company, having become part owner of the claim, took possession, and thereafter, asserting ownership to the whole, surrendered the same and procured the existing lease in its own name under the Act of 1920. The company became a cotenant with the McManus heirs, and consequently the lease ob- \n\n[274 U.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n tained by it inured to their benefit. Appellant purchased their interest February 11, 1922, and may now impress a trust upon the lease.\n The trial court held that no adequate ground for relief was disclosed, and dismissed the bill upon motion. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 F.(2d) 442.\n A motion to amend the bill, first made in this court, must be overruled. It does not appear that the alleged facts have been recently discovered and there is no affidavit in respect of them.\n The Act of February 25, 1920, provides:\n'Sec. 18. That upon relinquishment to the United States, filed in the General Land Office within six months after the approval of this act, of all right, title, and interest claimed and possessed prior to July 3, 1910, and continuously since by the claimant or his predecessor in interest under the pre-existing placer mining law to any oil or gas bearing land ... embraced in the executive order of withdrawal issued September 27, 1909, and not within any naval petroleum reserve, and upon payment as royalty to the United States of an amount equal to the value at the time of production of one-eighth of all the oil or gas already produced ... the claimant, or his successor, if in possession of such land, undisputed by any other claimant prior to July 1, 1919, shall be entitled to a lease thereon from the United States for a period of twenty years, at a royalty of not less than 12 1\/2 per centum of all the oil or gas produced. ...\n\n'All such leases shall be made and the amount of royalty to be paid for oil and gas produced, except oil or gas used for production purposes on the claim, or unavoidably lost, after the execution of such lease shall be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior under appropriate rules and regulations. ... In case of conflicting claimants for leases under this section, the Secretary of the Interior is \n\n[274 U.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n authorized to grant leases to one or more of them as shall be be deemed just. All leases hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the claimant and all persons claiming through or under him by lease, contract, or otherwise, as their interests may appear. ...\n\n'Sec. 32.

Comp. St.  4640 1\/4 i, 4640 1\/4 pp.\n\n The following is one of the regulations established by the Secretary:\n'24 1\/2. All proper parties to a claim for relief under sections 18, 19, or 22 of the act should join in the application, but, if for any sufficient reason that is impracticable, any person claiming a fractional or undivided interest in such claim may make application for a lease or permit, stating the nature and extent of his interest, and the reasons for nonjoinder of his co-owner or co-owners. In cases where two or more applications are made for the same claim or part of a claim, leases or permits will be granted to one or more of the claimants, as the law and facts shall warrant and as shall be deemed just.'\n\n Appellant insists that he is entitled to relief under the clause in the Act of 1920 which provides:\n'All leases hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the claimant and all persons claiming through or under him by lease, contract, or otherwise, as their interests may appear.'\n\n But we think it is clear enough that he does not claim 'through or under' either appellee, within the meaning of the act. Whatever rights he has, if any, come through or under George McManus and his heirs.\n He also maintains that out of the alleged cotenancy there arose a relation of trust and confidence between the Oil & Development Company and the McManus heirs, and therefore it cannot deny that the lease was procured \n\n[274 U.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n for the benefit of them as well as for itself, according to their respective interests.\n If appellant's predecessors owned an interest in the placer claim, certainly they never put themselves in position to receive a lease from the United States under the Act of 1920. They made no effort to surrender their right or comply with the prescribed prerequisites during the six months allowed. Prior to the granting of the lease they had no knowledge of rights now asserted. The Oil & Development Company did not obtain what otherwise would have been granted to them; and the principle under which the patentee was declared trustee for another in such cases as Silver v. Ladd, 7 Wall. 219, and Svor v. Morris, \n227 \nU.S. 524\n, 33 S. Ct. 385, does not apply. Anicker v. Gunsburg, \n246 \nU.S. 110, 117\n, 38 S. Ct. 228, 229 (62 L. Ed. 603), holds:\n'In order to maintain a suit of this sort the complainant must establish not only that the action of the Secretary was wrong in approving the other lease, but that the complainant was himself entitled to an approval of his lease, and that it was refused to him because of an erroneous ruling of law by the Secretary.'\n\n In order to support the view that in equity and good conscience the Oil & Development Company acted for the McManus heirs in securing the existing lease, it would be necessary to allege definite facts (not mere conclusions) sufficient to show some fiduciary relationship between them. This has not been done, unless such a relationship necessarily arose because of cotenancy. The rule as commonly stated forbids a cotenant from acquiring and asserting an adverse title against his companions because of the mutual trust and confidence supposed to exist; but the rule does not go beyond the reason which supports it. If the interests of the cotenants accrue at different times, under different instruments, and neither has superior means of information respecting the state \n\n[274 U.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n of the title, then either, unless he employs his cotenancy to secure an advantage, may acquire and assert a superior outstanding title, especially where there is no joint possession. This exception to the general rule is recognized in Turner v. Sawyer, \n150 \nU.S. 578, 586\n, 14 S. Ct. 192; Elder v. McClaskey (C. C. A.) 70 F. 529, 546; Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition,  155; Shelby v. Rhodes, 105 Miss. 255, 267, 62 So. 232, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 1306; Sands v. Davis, 40 Mich. 14, 18; Joyce v. Dyer, 189 Mass. 64, 67, 75 N. E. 81, 109 Am. St. Rep. 603; Steele v. Steele, 220 Ill. 318, 323, 77 N. E. 232. We know of no opinion by the courts of Wyoming to the contrary.\n The bill shows that the Oil & Development Company and its predecessors were in uninterrupted possession of the mining claim from 1905 to August 21, 1920, when it relinquished the same to the United States and applied for the lease; that throughout this period they held under assertion of right based on recorded conveyances purporting to pass the whole claim to them (which undoubtedly gave color of title) and did whatever was necessary to preserve it. There is no suggestion that any of them acknowledged the title was other than what these conveyances purported to pass or recognized the heirs of McManus as co-owners. Such holding must be regarded as exclusive and hostile to all others and not in any relationship of trust and confidence. It continued for fifteen years, during which the McManus heirs asserted no conflicting right or objection. They do not appear to have been infants or under disability. In no admissible view of the leasing act are they shown to have been entitled to the lease of any interest therein.\n We need not discuss laches as an equitable defense, the effect of the 10-year limitation prescribed by the Wyoming statute, or other points relied on by the appellees. In the circumstances, nothing short of distinct allegations of all the facts necessary to support appellant's \n\n[274 U.S. 15, 21]\n\u00a0\n claim for relief would suffice, and they are not to be found in the bill.\n The decree of the court below must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOFFMAN v. STATE OF MISSOURI(1927)\nNo. 225\nArgued: March 11, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Roy W. Rucker, of Sedalia, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Paul Barnett, of Sedalia, Mo., and L. D. Mitchell, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, which had granted, in an original proceeding, a peremptory writ of mandamus. 309 Mo. 625, 274 S. W. 362. Its judgment directed the judge of an inferior court to set aside a judgment dismissing an action and ordered him to entertain \n\n[274 U.S. 21, 22]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction. That action had been brought under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665) by a citizen and resident of Kansas for the death of an employee of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The accident occurred on its line in Kansas, and the deceased was a citizen of Kansas at the time of his death. The railroad is a Missouri corporation. The action was brought in a county traversed by the railroad, in which it had an office and an agent for the transaction of business. Under a statute of the state it was liable to suit there. Rev. Stat. Mo. 1919,  1180\n\n\n The railroad contends that, as it could have been sued in Kansas, where the accident occurred and the plaintiff resided, the statute, as applied, was void, under the doctrine of Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S. Ct. 556, and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S. Ct. 469, because a suit in Missouri would burden interstate commerce. In support of its contention, it was urged that the claims against the carrier for personal injuries are numberous; that the amounts demanded are large; that in many cases the carrier deems it advisable to leave the determination of liability to the courts; that in the action in question there were at least 11 employees working for it in Kansas who were material witnesses without whose attendance it could not safely proceed to trial; that to procure their attendance at the trial in Missouri would cause absence from their work in interstate commerce; and that this would subject the carrier to expense.\n These allegations remind of Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co. But other facts on which the decision of that case was rested are absent in the case at bar. Here, the railroad is not a foreign corporation; it is sued in the state of its incorporation. It is sued in a state in which it owns and operates a railroad. It is sued in a county in which it has an agent and a usual place of business. It is sued in a state in which it carries on doubtless intra- \n\n[274 U.S. 21, 23]\n\u00a0\n state as well as interstate business. Even a foreign corporation is not immune from the ordinary processes of the courts of a state, where its business is entirely interstate in character. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 579\n, 34 S. Ct. 944. It must submit, if there is jurisdiction, to the requirements of orderly, effective administration of justice, although thereby interstate commerce is incidentally burdened. Compare Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Ry. v. Taylor, \n266 \nU.S. 200\n, 45 S.

HALL(1927)\nNo. 815\nArgued: April 21, 1927Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Fred O. Blue, of Charleston, W. Va., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings up a decree by the Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia, which construed section 2a, chapter 1, Acts of the Legislature, Extraordinary Session 1925,1 and sus- \n\n[274 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n tained it against objections based upon section 8, article 1, federal Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. The grounds relied upon for reversal are without merit and the decree must be affirmed.\n The original proceeding challenged the validity of the tax prescribed by section 2a and sought an injunction to prevent defendant state officers from attempting to enforce it. The chief objection rested upon the direction of the statute that:\n'The measure of this tax is the value of the entire production in this state, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the state.'\n\n The trial court held that the tax would substantially burden and interfere with interstate commerce and ordered an appropriate injunction.\n In an opinion indicating very definite purpose to follow rulings here, the court below, as shown by the authoritative headnote, declared:\n'Under section \n\n[274 U.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n 2a, chapter 1, supra, the state may take into consideration the gross proceeds of a commodity produced in this state and sold in another state, but only for the purpose of determining the value of such commodity within the state and before it enters interstate commerce.' 135 S. E. 582.\n\n And among other things it there said:\n'If the taxation value of the products named in the statute be limited to their value in the state, and before they enter interstate commerce, the statute does not manifest a purpose to violate article 1 of the federal Construction, and we so hold.' 'We therefore hold, under the facts in this case, that the defendants may not treat the gross proceeds of plaintiff's sales outside the state as the worth of its gas within the state, but that they may enforce the act upon the value hereof within the state, and before it enters interstate commerce. The injunction herein will be accordingly so modified.'\n\n The final order directed:\n'That the decree of the circuit court of Kanawha county, pronounced in this cause on the 25th day of May, 1926, in so far and in so far only as it enjoins the defendants from enforcing against the plaintiff the provisions of section 2a ... by imposing a tax upon the natural gas produced by the plaintiff, based upon the value thereof within the state and before it enters interstate commerce, be and the same hereby is modified and corrected so as to permit defendants to impose and enforce against the plaintiff a tax, under said section, upon the natural gas so produced by it, based upon the value thereof within the state and before it enters upon interstate commerce, and that in all other respects said decree is hereby modified and corrected be and the same hereby is affirmed.'\n\n The chief business of plaintiff in error is production and purchase of natural gas in West Virginia and the continuous and uninterrupted transportation of this through pipe lines into Pennsylvania and Ohio, where it is sold, deliv- \n\n[274 U.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n ered and consumed. The corporation owns 3,178 producing wells located in 25 counties of West Virginia, from which it took in the year ending June 30, 1925, more than 23,000,000,000 cubic feet of gas. And during the same period it purchased from other producers more than 25,000,000,000 cubic feet. Most of this passed into interstate commerce by continuous movement from the wells.\n Here it has been argued that the challenged act burdens interstate commerce and therefore conflicts with section 8, article 1, of the federal Constitution; also that to enforce the act would deprive plaintiff in error of property without due process of law and deny equal protection of the laws.\n Counsel admit that without violating the commerce clause the state may lay a privilege or occupation tax upon producers of natural gas reckoned according to the value of that commodity at the well. American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S. Ct. 552; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S. Ct. 83; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S. Ct. 526. But they insist that, accepting the statute under consideration as construed by the highest court of the state, plaintiff in error will be subjected to an unlawful direct tax upon gross receipts derived from interstate commerce. This argument rests chiefly upon certain language excerpted from the opinion below. But we review the final decree and must accept the statute as authoritatively construed and applied. The plain result of the opinion and final decree is to require that the tax be computed upon the value of the gas at the well, and not otherwise. If, hereafter, executive officers disregard the approved construction and fix values upon any improper basis appropriate relief may be obtained through the courts.\n The suggestion concerning deprivation of due process goes upon the assumption that the imposition is upon \n\n[274 U.S. 284, 289]\n\u00a0\n gross receipts from interstate commerce, in reality upon property beyond the state's jurisdiction. As already pointed out, this assumption conflicts with the definite ruling of the highest court of the state.\n The claim that equal protection of the laws has been denied rests upon the assertion, first, that an unlawful tax has been imposed upon the gross proceeds from sales regardless of their place and, second, that the exemption of $10,000 from gross income by section 2h creates undue inequality. The true meanof the statute and the thing actually taxed oppose the first assertion. We cannot say that the Legislature acted either arbitrarily or unreasonably by authorizing the deduction. Nothing indicates a purpose to extend different treatment to those of the same class; no actual unreasonable inequality has been shown. Plaintiff in error is permitted to deduct $10,000; the same privilege, and nothing more, is extended to all other producers. Lake Superior Mines v. Lord, \n271 \nU.S. 577\n, 46 S.

The first suit, which resulted in a judgment for the government (affirmed 238 F. 431), was predicated upon the following circumstances:\n The United States, in 1894, made a grant of public lands to the state of Utah to aid in the establishment of an agricultural college, certain schools and asylums, and for other purposes. Sections 8 and 10, Act of July 16, 1894, c. 138, 28 Stat. 107, 109, 110. Mineral lands were not included. See Milner v. United States (C. C. A.) 228 F. 431, 439; United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563\n, 38 S. Ct. 193; Mullan v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 271, 276\n, 6 S. Ct. 1041; section 2318, R. S. (Comp. St.  4613). The grant was not of lands in piece. Selections were to be made by the state with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, from unappropriated public lands, in such manner as the Legislature should provide. The Legislature (Laws Utah 1896, c. 80) later created a board of land commissioners, with general supervisory powers over the disposition of the lands, and with authority to select particular lands under the grants.\n During the period from December 10, 1900, to September 14, 1903, Milner and others, the predecessors in interest of the Carbon County Land Company, one of the petitioners, made several applications to the state commission to select and obtain in the name of the state the lands now in question, and at the same time entered \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 643]\n\u00a0\n into agreements with the commission to purchase the lands from the state. In aid of the applications and agreements, Milner and his associates filed affidavits with the commission, stating that they were acquainted with the character of these lands, which they affirmed were nonmineral and did not contain deposits of coal. They also deposed that the applications were not made for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining mineral holdings, but to acquire the land for agricultural use. The applicants were obviously aware that the affidavits or the information contained in them would in due course be submitted to the Land Office of the United States with the state commission's selections, as they were in fact. On the faith of these and other documents, the selections were approved by the Secretary of the Interior and the tracts in question were certified to the state on various dates, the last being in December, 1904. Certification was the mode of passing title from the United States to the state.\n In January, 1907, the United States brought the first suit, against Milner and his associates and the Carbon County Land Company, which had been organized by Milner to take over the land, and was controlled by him. The suit was founded on the charge that the certifications were procured by the fraudulent misrepresentations of Milner and the others, since they knew at the time of the applications that the lands contained coal deposits. Although the bill in the present case states that the relief asked was the cancellation of the contracts between the state and Milner and his associates, this allegation is apparently inadvertent, for the record elsewhere indicates that the bill in fact sought the quieting of the government's title. It affirmatively appears that on June 8, 1914, the District Court entered a decree declaring that the United States 'is the owner' and 'entitled to the possession' of the lands in question and that the de- \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 644]\n\u00a0\n fendants 'have no right, title, or interest, or right of possession,' and perpetually enjoining them 'from setting up or making any claim to or upon said premises.' The Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the decree, held that 'the whole transaction was a scheme or conspiracy on the part of Milner to fraudulently obtain the ownership of these lands from the United States.'\n In bringing suit in this form, without making the state of Utah a party, it is evident that the government relied on the principles announced in Williams v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 514\n, 11 S. Ct. 457. In that case it was held, on a similar state of facts, that the state of Nevada was not a necessary party to the suit, and that the contract between it and its purchaser operated to vest the equitable interest in the lands in him, the legal interest being retained as security for the purchase price. This court said:\n'The state of Nevada might have intervened. It did not, doubtless because it felt it had no real interest. It was no intentional party to any wrong upon the general government. If its agency had been used by the wrongdoer to obtain title from the general government; if, conscious of no wrong on its part, it had obtained from the general government the legal title and conveyed it away to the alleged wrongdoer, it might justly say that it had no interest in the controversy, and that it would leave to the determination of the courts the question of right between the government and the alleged wrongdoer, and conform its subsequent action to that determination. That certainly is the dignified and proper course to be pursued by a state, which is charged to have been the innocent instrumentality and agent by which a title to real estate has been wrongfully obtained from the general government.' Pages 516, 517 (11 S. Ct. 458).\n\n The present suit is founded on the allegation that the state of Utah, not conforming its action to the decision in the first suit, despite the decree and the findings of \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 645]\n\u00a0\n fraud upon which it was based, has conveyed the legal title to the fraudulent purchasers. The bill was filed in May, 1924, against the Carbon County Land Company and the Independent Coal & Coke Company, petitioners here, and others whose interests are not now material. It sets up the equitable title or interest of the United States in the land, based upon the decree in the first suit, a copy of which, with the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in that case, it incorporated; the conveyance by patent of the state's legal interest to petitioner, the Carbon County Land Company; and explains that the Independent Coal & Coke Company was made a party as it claims an interest in a part of the lands, the full nature and extent of which is unknown to plaintiff. The relief asked is that a trust be impressed in favor of plaintiff; that defendants be ordered to convey whatever title they have, subject only to any mortgages the state may have retained in conveying the legal title; and that they be enjoined from mining coal.\n The defendants separately moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action against any of them and that the action was barred by the statute of limitations (Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561,  8, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099 (Comp. St.  5114)), limiting suits by the United States to vacate and annul patents to six years from the date of issue. The judgment of the District Court dismissing the bill as barred by the statute was reversed by Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 9 F. (2d) 517. This court granted certiorari. \n270 \nU.S. 639\n, 46 S. Ct. 355.\n Petitioners maintain that the bill fails to allege any facts showing that the Carbon County Land Company is a trustee of the lands, or bound in equity to surrender them to the government. Conceding the full force and effect of the decree in the first suit, they assert that the state of Utah was not a party to it, or bound by its decree; that the title of the state, if ever open to attack by \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 646]\n\u00a0\n the United States, ripened into an indefeasible title by lapse of time under the six-year statute of limitations; and that petitioner may clothe themselves with the protection of that title despite the decree in the earlier suit.\n We may assume for the purposes of the present case, without deciding, that the state officials were not cognizant of the fraud perpetrated upon the United States, and that the legal title of the state was not affected by the decree in the first suit, although the United States in an appropriate proceeding might have procured the annulment of the certification, at least within the period of limitations. Cf. United States v. Sweet, supra; Mullan v. United States, supra. But it does not follow that the defendants in the first suit could receive from the state the fruits of their fraud free of an equitable obligation to make restitution to the government, or that the United States could not avail itself of all that was adjudged in its favor by the decree in the first suit, even if its original cause of action against the state were barred. By the contracts of purchase, Milner and his associates acquired an equitable interest in the land. Williams v. United States, supra. Their interest was transferred to the Carbon County Land Company, created and controlled by them for that purpose, as a part of the fraudulent conspiracy condemned in the first suit. The decree in that suit is conclusive that the company was a party to the fraudulent scheme or conspiracy to acquire title to the public lands by using the state and its officials as agencies to procure the transfer. The decree not only established that the United States was the true and full owner of the land to the exclusion of the defendants, but perpetually enjoined them from setting up or making any claim to the lands. This and the issues of fact there resolved in favor of the United States, and pleaded here, lead to the conclusion that none of the defendants, nor any claiming under them with notice, could by any legal \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 647]\n\u00a0\n device, however ingenious, acquire title from the state free from the taint of their fraud.\n The suit is in the nature of a supplemental bill in aid of the former decree and is an appropriate method of securing the benefit of the first decree when subsequent events have made necessary some further relief in order that the plaintiff may enjoy the full fruits of the victory in the first suit. Cf. Root v. Woolworth, \n150 \nU.S. 401\n, 14 S. Ct. 136; Shields v. Thomas, 18 How. 253, 262; Thompson v. Maxwell \n95 U.S. 391\n; Story, Equity Pleading (10th Ed.)  338, 339, 345, 351(b), 353, 429, 432; Cooper, Equity Pleading, 74, 75. In determining the scope of the present bill and the relief which may be given upon it, we may consider the pleadings and proceedings in the earlier suit, the nature of which are fully disclosed in the opinion and decree in that suit, which are pleaded here.\n It is ancient and familiar learning that one who fraudulently procures a conveyance may not defeat the defrauded grantor or protect himself from the consequences of his fraud by having the title conveyed to an innocent third person.

Equity may follow the property until it reaches the hands of an innocent purchaser for value. Even then the wrongdoer may not reacquire it free of the obligation which equity imposes on one who despoils another of his property by fraud or a breach of trust. The obligation in personam to make restitution persists and may be enforced by compelling a return of the property itself whenever and however it comes into his hands. Bovey v. Smith, 1 Vern. 60; Kennedy v. Daly, 1 Sch. & L. 355, 379; Williams v. Williams, 118 Mich. 477, 76 N. W. 1039; Talbert v. Singleton, 42 Cal. 390; Schutt v. Large, 6 Barb. (N. Y.) 373, 380; Church v.

Critcher, 112 Va. 870, 876, 72 S. E. 594. 2 Pomeroy, Equity,  754. So here the obligation, having its inception in the fraud which was established in the first suit, has been confirmed by the decree and persists as to every interest acquired by petitioners under the contracts with the state or which may be enjoyed by them as the fruit of their fraud, even though we assume for the moment that the title acquired by them could not have been challenged while in the hands of the state.\n It having been adjudicated that the government is the true owner of whatever rights the land company acquired under the earlier contracts with the state, the decree must be deemed either to have transferred those rights to the government or to have determined that the government is equitably entitled to have them so transferred. If the former, the government may assert the rights under the contract against the land company, as holder of the legal title, as it might against any other purchaser of the land from the state with notice. Bird v. Hall, 30 Mich. 374. If the latter, the land company could not acquire the lands even through a new and independent contract without a surrender of such rights as it had under the earlier contracts, and it could not make the surrender effective against the United States, the real owner, without its assent, unless the state stood in the position of a purchaser for value without notice. To these rights the government is equitably entitled, and hence may at its election claim the benefit of their proceeds in the hands of the land company. Cf. United States v. Dunn, \n268 \nU.S. 121\n, 45 S. Ct. 451; Taylor v. Kelly, 56 N. C. 240; Haughwout & Pomeroy v. Murphy, 22 N. J. Eq. 531, 547. \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 649]\n\u00a0\n Even if the title acquired were through a new and independent contract and even though it were not in a strick sense proceeds of the earlier contracts, the relation of the land company and its equitable obligation to the government, and its duty under the decree in the first suit, are such as to preclude the acquisition of any outstanding interest in the land in violation of the decree, free of that obligation and duty.

Westcott, 15 R. I. 373, 5 A. 629; Middletown Savings Bank v. Bacharach, 46 Conn. 513.\n We need not inquire now whether there may be defenses to the cause of action stated in the bill. It is enough for present purposes that, despite unskilled draftsmanship, it sets out facts sufficient, on a motion to dismiss, to support the relief prayed.\n But it is argued that there are no allegations showing that petitioner, Independent Coal & Coke Company, is a party to the fraud or what interest it claims in the lands, or that it acquired any interest from or under any other party to the transaction. But we think it fairly inferrable from the bill, taken as a whole, that the interest alleged to be claimed by the coal company was one arising subsequent to the conveyance by the state to the land company. The bill sets up title in the United States and its transfer to the state alleging that the state of Utah in making the transfer relied on the fact that it had not parted with the legal title to the lands at the time of the decree. This in effect is an averment that the interest claimed by the \n\n[274 U.S. 640, 650]\n\u00a0\n coal company was acquired subsequent to the certification by the United States to the state. Whatever interest it acquired after that event, it took subject to the equities of the United States, and if from the land company, subject also to all of the equities against that company, unless the purchase price was bona fide. Bona fide purchase is an affirmative defense. Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 397, 403\n, 35 S. Ct. 339.\n The statute of limitations relied on provides that suits by the United States 'to vacate and annul any patent ... shall only be brought within six years after the date of the issuance of such patents.' A point much argued here was whether a certification of public lands is a patent within the meaning of the statute. But that is a question which we need not decide. Statutes of limitation against the United States are to be narrowly construed. United States v. Whited & Wheless, \n246 \nU.S. 552, 561\n, 38 S. Ct. 367. And we think it plain that the present suit, founded on equitable grounds, to compel a conveyance of title derived from a certification by the government is not a suit to cancel the certification. See United States v. New Orleans Pacific Ry., \n248 \nU.S. 507, 510\n, 518 S., 39 S. Ct. 175.\n We hold that the acquisition of the title of the lands by the land company as set out in the bill was in violation of equitable principles and of the decree enjoining the defendants in the first suit 'from setting up or making any claim to the premises,' and that a proper case was stated for the imposition on both petitioners of a constructive trust with respect to the lands acquired by them. As the bill is not well drafted, respondent should have leave to perfect it. This will promote an orderly and intelligent disposition of the case.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINGENOHL v.

Meyerstein, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frederic R. Coudert, Jr., of New York City, Allison D. Gibbs, of Manila, Philippine Islands, and Mahlon B. Doing, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the costs adjudged to the plaintiff, the petitioner here, in a former suit that was brought by him against the defendant in the British Colony of Hongkong and was determined in his favor by the Su- \n\n[273 U.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n preme Court there. The judgment declared the plaintiff to be the owner of certain trade-marks and trade-names and entitled to the exclusive use of them in connection with his business as a cigar manufacturer. It restrained the defendants from selling cigars under these trade-marks and awarded the costs now sued for. The Court of First Instance of Manila gave judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands reversed this decision on the ground that by section 311(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure a judgment against a person 'may be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud or clear mistake of law or fact,' and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Hongkong showed such a clear mistake.\n The supposed mistake consisted in denying effect in Hongkong to a sale of business and trade-marks by the Alien Property Custodian to the defendant, the circumstances and nature of which may be stated in few words so far as they concern the present case. The plaintiff Ingenohl had built up a great business as a cigar manufacturer and exporter having his factory at Manila. In 1908 he established a factory at Hongkong and thereafter goods from both factories were sold under the same trade-marks, the outside box or package of the Hongkong goods having a label indicating that they came from there. The trade-marks were registered in Hongkong and the cigars covered by them had acquired a reputation. In 1918 the Alien Property Custodian seized and sold all the property 'wheresoever situate in the Philippine Islands ... including the business as going concern, and the good will, trade-names and trade-marks thereof, of Syndicat Oriente,' being the above mentioned business of the plaintiff in the Philippines. The Supreme Court of the Philippines held that it was plain error in the Supreme Court of the British Colony to hold that this sale did not \n\n[273 U.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n carry the exclusive right to use the trade-marks in the latter place.\n A trade-mark started elsewhere would depend for its protection in Hongkong upon the law prevailing in Hongkong and would confer no rights except by the consent of that law. Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403\n, 36 S. Ct. 357, United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., \n248 \nU.S. 90\n, 39 S. Ct. 48. When then the judge who, in the absence of an appeal to the Privy Council, is the final exponent of that law, authoritatively declares that the assignment by the Custodian of the assets of the Manila firm cannot and will not be allowed to affect the rights of the party concerned in Hongkong, we do not see how it is possible for a foreign Court to pronounce his decision wrong. It will be acted on and settles the rights of the parties in Hongkong and in view of that fact it seems somewhat paradoxical to say that it is not the law. If the Alien Property Custodian purported to convey rights in English territory valid as against those whom the English law protects he exceeded the powers that were or could be given to him by the United States.\n It is not necessary to consider whether the section of the Code of Civil Procedure relied upon was within the power of the Philippine Commission to pass. In any event as interpreted it involved delicate considerations of international relations and therefore we should not hold ourselves bound to that deference that we show to the judgment of the local Court upon matters of only local concern. We are of opinion that whatever scope may be given to the section it is far from warranting the refusal to enforce this English judgment for costs, obtained after a fair trial before a court having jurisdiction of the parties, when the judgment is unquestionably valid and in other respects will be enforced. Of course a foreign state might accept the Custodian's transfer as good within its jurisdiction, if there were no opposing local interest or right, \n\n[273 U.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n and that may be the fact for China outside of Hongkong as seems to have been held in another case not yet finally disposed of, but no principle requires the transfer to be given effect outside of the United States and when as here it has been decided to have been ineffectual it is unnecessary to inquire whether in the other event the Alien Property Custodian was authorized by the statute to use or did use in fact words purporting to have that effect, or what the effect, if any, would be.\n Some question was made of the jurisdiction of this Court. The jurisdiction was asserted, at least provisionally, when the writ of certiorari was granted. There are few cases in which it is more important to maintain it, and we confirm it now. The validity of the section of the Code of Civil Procedure is drawn in question, and also the construction of the Trading with the Enemy Act (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 a-3115 1\/2 j) which is treated as purporting to authorize what in our opinion it could not authorize if it tried.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE BUSSES CORP. v. HOLYOKE ST. RY. CO.(1927)\nNo. 343\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 45, 46]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward H. Kelly and Augustine Lonergan, both of Hartford, Conn., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David H. Keedy and William H. Brooks, both of Springfield, Mass., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by appellant against the Holyoke Street Railway Company, its president and general manager, police and prosecuting officers of a number of cities and towns, the chief of the state police, and the district attorneys of the Western and Northern Districts of Massachusetts. Its purpose is to restrain the enforcement of a state statute relating to common carriers of passengers by motor vehicles as in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was heard before a court of three judges (section 266, Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1243)) on an agreed statement of facts, and a final decree dismissing the complaint was entered.\n Sections 45, 48a and 49 of chapter 159, General Laws, as amended by c. 280, Acts of 1925, contain the provisions attacked: No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a public way in any city or town for the carriage of passengers for hire so as to afford a means of transportation similar to that afforded by a railway company by indiscriminately receiving and discharging passengers along the route on which the vehicle is operated, or as a business between fixed and regular termini, without first obtaining a license. The licensing authority in a city is its council, \n\n[273 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n in a town is its selectmen; and, as to public ways under its control, is the metropolitan district commission. No person shall operate a motor vehicle under such license unless he has also obtained from the department of public utilities a certificate that public convenience and necessity require such operation. Any one operating under a license from local authority and a certificate from the department is declared to be a common carrier and subject to regulation as such. Violations of sections 45-48, or of any order, rule, or regulation made under them, are punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. And the act gives to the Supreme Judicial and superior courts jurisdiction in equity to restrain any violation upon petition of the department, any licensing authority, ten citizens of a city or town affected by the violation, or any interested party. Neither license nor certificate is required in respect of such carriage as may be exclusively interstate.\n The material facts stipulated are: For many years, the appellee Holyoke Street Railway Company has been a common carrier of passengers by street railway in Massachusetts through Holyoke, South Hadley, Granby, Amherst, and into Sunderland. Appellant is engaged in the business of transporting passengers for hire by motor vehicle, and operates busses between Hartford, Conn., and Greenfield, Mass. It has operated its busses between Hartford and Springfield since December 1, 1924, and north of Springfield to Greenfield since about December 15, 1925. Its route in Massachusetts passes through Springfield, West Springfield, Holyoke, Granby, Amherst, Sunderland, Deerfield, and Greenfield. With certain exceptions not here material, all its busses run the whole distance between Hartford and Greenfield. It transports persons from one state into the other, and also those whose journeys begin and end in Massachusetts. Both classes of passengers, intrastate and inter- \n\n[273 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n state, are carried in the same vehicles. Intrastate passengers constitute a very substantial part of the whole number carried in Massachusetts. Appellant maintains an office and garage at Springfield and advertises its route and rates. The busses are operated between fixed termini in Massachusetts. They operate regularly on public ways parallel to and alongside the tracks of the street railway company and afford means of transportation similar to those furnished by that company. They stop regularly and also on signal to receive and discharge passengers. The operation of the busses in competition with the street railway has resulted in substantial loss to the latter. Appellant has not obtained a license from any of the cities or towns served by the street railway company. And that company, its president and counsel, have caused plaintiff's employees to be arrested and prosecuted, and intend to continue to prosecute them, for operating without obtaining the licenses and certificate required by the statute.\n The statutory provisions in question have been sustained by the highest court of Massachusetts. New York, N. H. & H. Railroad v. Deister, 253 Mass. 178, 148 N. E. 590; Barrows v. Farnum's Stage Lines (Mass.) 150 N. E. 206; Boston & M. R. R. v. Cate (Mass.) 150 N. E. 210; Boston & M. R. R. v. Hart, (Mass.) 150 N. E. 212; Commonwealth v. Potter (Mass.) 150 N. E. 213. And these decisions were followed by the District Court in this case.\n Appellant's principal contention is that the act contravenes the commerce clause. If as applied it directly interferes with or burdens appellant's interstate commerce, it cannot be sustained, regardless of the purpose for which it was passed. See Shafter v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 199\n, 45 S. Ct. 481; Real Silk Mills v. Portland, \n268 \nU.S. 325, 336\n, 45 S. Ct. 525; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 163\n, 46 S. Ct. 452; Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34\n, 47 S. Ct. 267, 71 L. Ed. -. The act existed in some form before interstate transportation of pas- \n\n[273 U.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n sengers for hire by motor vehicle was undertaken. Its purpose is to regulate local and intrastate affairs. Barrows v. Farnum's Stage Lines, supra. No licenses from local authorities or certificate of public convenience and necessity is required in respect of transportation that is exclusively interstate. Cf. Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A. L. R. 286; Bush Co. v. Maloy, \n267 \nU.S. 317\n, 45 S. Ct. 326, 327. The burden is upon appellant to show that enforcement of the act operates to prejudice interstate carriage of passengers. The stipulated facts do not so indicate. The threatened enforcement is to prevent appellant from carrying intrastate passengers without license over that part of its route which is parallel to the street railway. Its right to use the highways between Springfield and Hartford is not in controversy. While it appears that in Massachusetts both classes of passengers are carried in the same vehicles, it is not shown what part of the total number are intrastate or interstate. The record contains no information as to the number of persons, if any, traveling in interstate commerce on appellant's busses over the part of the route competing with the street railway. It is not shown that the two classes of business are so commingled that the separation of one from the other is not reasonably practicable or that appellant's interstate passengers may not be carried efficiently and economically in busses used exclusively for that purpose or that appellant's interstate business is dependent in any degree upon the local business in question. Appellant may not evade the act by the mere linking of its intrastate transportation to its interstate or by the unnecessary transportation of both classes by means of the same instrumentalities and employees. The appellant relies on Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S. Ct. 190, and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56\n, 30 S. Ct. 232. But there the state was using its authority as a means to accomplish a result beyond its constitutional power.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 45, 52]\n\u00a0\n There is no support for the contention that the enforcement of the act deprives it of its property without due process of law. Undoubtedly the state has power in the public interest reasonably to control and regulate the use of its highways, so long as it does not directly burden or interfere with interstate commerce. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 144\n, 44 S. Ct. 257; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S. Ct. 140. Cf. Opinion of the Justices, 251 Mass. 594, 596, 147 N. E. 681. The terms of the act are not arbitrary or unreasonable. Appellant has not applied for and does not show that it is entitled to have a license from the local authorities or a certificate of public necessity and convenience from the department. Plainly, it has no standing to attack the validity of the statute as a violation of the due process clause.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJACOB REED'S SONS v.

C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219) from a judgment for the United States entered by the Court \n\n[273 U.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n of Claims, before the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936. The suit was brought under the Dent Act (Act March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 (Comp. St.  3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 e)) by a manufacturer of clothing, to recover the actual loss incurred in renting and equipping a factory required, during the World War, in order to make uniforms for the government, and for which factory there was no use after the Armistice. The claim, as alleged in the petition, is that the depot quartermaster at Philadelphia agreed that, if the plaintiff would rent and equip the factory, 'the United States, through the Secretary of War, and the contracting officer, the depot quartermaster, would award sufficient contracts to plaintiff which, at a fair margin over cost, would enable it to amortize the cost of said lease, machinery, and equipment,' and that, if sufficient contracts were not awarded to amortize the plant, the United States would save plaintiff harmless from any loss.\n The Court of Claims did not find as a fact that any such contract, express or implied, was made. It found that the depot quartermaster, while urging plaintiff to rent and equip the factory, 'stated (orally) that contracts would be placed with plaintiff which would fully reimburse it for the proposed expenditure.' The court concluded, as matter of law, that there was no contract; that, if the contract had in fact been made as alleged, it would not have bound the government, because, so far as the record disclosed, the depot quartermaster had no authority so to bind it; and that, as there was no agreement, and also because such authority was lacking, the Dent Act did not afford a remedy. 60 Ct. Cl. 97.\n The contracts for uniforms given the plaintiff were canceled by the government. The right to cancel these is not questioned, and no claim is made here for compensation for canceling them. Compare Russel Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514\n, 43 S. Ct. 428; College Point Boat Corp. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 12, 15\n, 45 S. Ct. 199. The argu- \n\n[273 U.S. 200, 202]\n\u00a0\n ment here consisted mainly of an effort to show, by reference in the brief to portions of the evidence introduced before the Court of Claims, that the contract sued on was made as alleged, and that authority to make it had been conferred upon the depot quartermaster. The evidence is not before us, and we must accept the findings of the Court of Claims. Rogers v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 154, 162\n, 46 S. Ct. 275. Moreover, it is doubtful whether ever express authorization could, under the then existing statutes, have conferred upon anyone the power to make the contract which the plaintiff has attempted to prove. See Rev. Stat.  3732, as amended by Act June 12, 1906, c. 3078, 34 Stat. 240, 255 (Comp. St.  6884, 6885); Rev. Stat.  3709, Act July 5, 1884, c. 217, 23 Stat. 107, 109 (Comp. St.  6832, 6846-6848); Act March 2, 1901, c. 803, 31 Stat. 895, 905 (Comp. St.  6852).\n The decision of the lower court was clearly correct. The Dent Act gave a remedy upon contracts irregularly made, not upon contracts made without authority. Nor did it give a cause of action on dealings which did not ripen into a contract.

Woolsey and Harrington Putnam, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[274 U.S. 614, 615]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James M. Gorman, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n April 17, 1919, the company made a contract to sell Rivara a tugboat. The vessel had been documented by the company in the custom house in New York as a vessel of the United States and was enrolled for coasting voyages between ports of the United States. It was operated in interstate and intrastate commerce. The purchase price was to be paid in installments, and title was not to pass until all was paid. When the contract was made, the buyer paid part and the seller delivered the tug to him. The contract provided that in case of default the seller might take possession of the tug and that all payments on the purchase price should be applied solely as rental. The buyer agreed, pending the fulfillment of the contract, properly to maintain the tug, to keep it free from libels and to pay for insurance. After making some additional payments on the purchase price, the buyer defaulted. The seller instituted proceedings in admiralty for possession; and, pursuant to a decree dated April 7, 1921, obtained the tug subject to any rights or accountability which it might be under by reason of the New York Sales Act or any other law. In January, 1922, the buyer brought this action to recover the amount paid on the purchase price. The basis of his claim was that, although he did not comply with the contract or make good his default, the seller failed to sell the tug, or to give notice of sale, in accordance with sections 65 and 66 of the Personal Property Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 41). The seller answered that the state law did not apply to vessels documented in accordance with federal law and set up counterclaims for amounts paid by it to or for the buyer. The case was tried without a jury; the court found the amount of the buyer's payments with interest, the rental \n\n[274 U.S. 614, 616]\n\u00a0\n value of the tug and the amount paid by the seller for maintenance and insurance. It held that the conditional sale was subject to the state law, that the seller was not entitled to credit for the rental value, and gave the buyer judgment for the amount of his payments with interest less the sums paid by the seller. The judgment was affirmed in the Appellate Division (214 App. Div. 737, 210 N. Y. S. 911), and in the Court of Appeals (241 N. Y. 259, 149 N. E. 851).\n Plaintiff in error contended in the Court of Appeals, and here insists, that, as applied in this case, section 65 interferes with interstate commerce because it requires the vessel to be withdrawn from service for more than 30 days, and infringes the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United States because during the same period it conflicts with the enforcement of maritime liens; that, by the Enrollment Act (R. S.  4311 (Comp. St.  8057)), and the Recording Act (R. S.  4192 ( Comp. St.  7778)), Congress created a form of property known as 'vessels of the United States,' and brought such property within its exclusive jurisdiction under the commerce clause; and that the state law conflicts with the acts of Congress and therefore cannot be given effect.\n The contract was made before the passage of the Jones Act, approved June 5, 1920. 41 Stat. 988, 1000, c. 250. Section 4311, Revised Statutes, provides that vessels of 20 tons or upward enrolled in pursuance of this title (50) and having license in force as required by this title shall be deemed vessels of the United States, entitled to the benefits and privileges appertaining to such vessels employed in the coasting trade. \n1\n And section 4192 provides that no bill of sale, mortgage, hypothecation, or conveyance of any vessel of the United States shall be valid against any persons, other than the grantor or mortgagor, his heirs and devisees, and persons having actual notice \n\n[274 U.S. 614, 617]\n\u00a0\n thereof, unless recorded in the office of the collector of the customs where such vessel is registered or enrolled. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Article 4 of the New York Personal Property Law regulates contracts for conditional sale of goods and chattels. Section 65 relates to the sale of property retaken by the conditional vendor. It provides that whenever articles sold on the condition that the title shall remain in the vendor until payment of the purchase price, are retaken by the vendor, they shall be retained for 30 days during which the vendee may comply with the contract and receive the property; that after the expiration of that period, if the contract is not complied with, the vendor may cause the articles to be sold at public auction, and that, unless they are so sold within thirty days after the expiration of such period, the vendee may recover the amount paid on such articles under the contract. The Court of Appeals held that section 65 applies to the enrolled tugboat, and, unless that construction brings the state law into conflict with the Constitution or acts of Congress, it will be followed by this court.\n Clearly there is nothing in the state law to interfere with the use of such vessels as instrumentalities of interstate commerce. Its enforcement does not require that the tugboat be withdrawn from service after retaking by the conditional vendor; and the change of possession would not necessarily interfere with its use in interstate commerce. And, if interpreted to require the vessel to be withdrawn from service for a time, the law would not for that reason be invalid. Martin v. West, \n222 \nU.S. 191, 197\n, 198 S., 32 S. Ct. 42, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.) 592; Davis v. C. C. C. & St. L. R. Co., \n217 \nU.S. 157, 174\n, 30 S. Ct. 463, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 823, 18 Ann. Cas. 907, et seq.; The Winnebago, \n205 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 27 S.

Ct. 254. \n\n[274 U.S. 614, 618]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for plaintiff in error argues that, during the period which the state law requires property retaken to be retained, persons having claims against such vessels for supplies, salvage, wages of seamen and the like cannot proceed in rem to enforce their maritime liens. But the controversy in this case is exclusively between the buyer and seller. No third person is here asserting rights as a purchaser or as a maritime lien claimant. And we need not consider what effect, if any, enforcement of the provisions of section 65 would have in a case where such rights are in issue. Gorieb v. Fox et al., \n274 \nU.S. 603\n, 47 S. Ct. 675, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this day.\n The Recording Act (9 Stat. 440) was passed to furnish information as to title and to protect bona fide purchasers. White's Bank v. Smith, 7 Wall. 646, 655. The act expressly declares that it does not affect the title to vessels as between the parties to the transactions to which it applies. Congress has not undertaken to regulate contracts for conditional sales of vessels or other property used to carry on interstate commerce. It has not entered the field occupied by the state law in question. The purpose of the enrollment of vessels is to give to them the privileges of American vessels as well as the protection of our flag. There is no foundation for the contention earnestly urged by plaintiff in error that Congress by these acts created 'a new form of property known as vessels of the United States' or that enrolled vessels are 'nationalized or federalized' in respect of conditional sale contracts such as the one here involved. The enrollment of such vessels is not inconsistent with the application of the state law. Its provisions are not directed against interstate commerce or any regulations concerning it. As interpreted and applied by the state court, it merely regulates contracts for conditional sale of an enrolled vessel used in interstate commerce. In the absence of legislation by Congress in respect of the matter, the \n\n[274 U.S. 614, 619]\n\u00a0\n power of the state to enforce such a law cannot be doubted. Sherlock v.

HARRY(1927)\nNo. 40\nArgued: Decided: January 10, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George F. Rearick, of Danville, Ill., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. William M. Acton, of Danville, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was commenced in an Illinois court by Mrs. Harry, a citizen of that state, against Dickinson, a citizen of Texas, and James- Dickinson Farm Mortgage Company, a Missouri corporation. The defendants removed the case to the federal court on the ground of diversity of citizenship. Dickinson, who had been served personally within Illinois, pleaded to the merits. The company, upon whom service had been made by reading and delivering the summons to Dickinson, 'as its president,' while he was temporarily in Illinois, challenged the jurisdiction of the court over it. This objection was overruled; and it also filed pleas to the merits. The case was then tried, as against both defendants, before a \n\n[273 U.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n jury; the plaintiff got a verdict; and judgment was entered thereon. Because of a claim that rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been denied them, a direct writ of error was allowed under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), before the amendment of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 938,  1 (Comp. St.  1215)).\n The action is in tort to recover damages resulting from false representations by which the plaintiff was induced to purchase while in Texas a tract of land located there. The declaration contains two counts, the first based on the common law liability, the second on a statute of that state. Act of March 11, 1919, c. 43; General Laws, p. 77; Complete Tex. St. 1920, tit. 62, arts. 3973a-3973c, p. 639. Dickinson was vice president and treasurer of the defendant corporation and also of two other allied corporations. He together with James, the president of the corporations, owned 90 per cent. of their stock. It was charged that these corporations were the instruments through which the fraudulent scheme was carried out. The device employed in effecting the sale was the taking of the plaintiff and other alleged victims from the North in midwinter by a special Pullman from Kansas City to Brownsville, near which the land lies, and securing signatures from all on the spot. There was evidence to show that the people in charge of the party made materially false statements concerning the quality of the land sold. Dickinson did not then talk personally with the plaintiff; but he was present on the occasion, heard the false statements then made, took direct part in sales then made, and later personally induced the plaintiff to anticipate the payment on notes given as part of the purchase price.\n In the course of the trial a multitude of requests for rulings made by the defendants were denied. Many other rulings to which they objected were given. Exceptions were duly taken. As the case is properly here on constitutional grounds, the jurisdiction of this court extends \n\n[273 U.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n to a review of all questions. Chaloner v. Sherman, \n242 \nU.S. 455, 457\n, 37 S. Ct. 136. All have been considered. Only a few require discussion.\n First. The objection to the jurisdiction over the corporation was taken by a plea in abatement. The decision thereon was made upon a demurrer to the replication. By these pleadings it was admitted that the residence and principal place of business of the corporation was in Missouri; that it had never been a resident of Illinois; that Dickinson, its president, was in Illinois on business of the corporation at the time of the service; but that it has not engaged in, or carried on, business within the state. Jurisdiction over a corporation of one state cannot be acquired in another state or district in which it has no place of business and is not found, merely by serving process upon an executive officer temporarily therein, even if he is there on business of the company. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 364\n, 37 S. Ct. 280; Rosenberg Bros. v. Curtis Brown Co., \n260 \nU.S. 516\n, 43 S. Ct. 170; Bank of America v. Whitney Central National Bank, \n261 \nU.S. 171\n, 43 S. Ct. 311; Lumiere v. Wilder, \n261 \nU.S. 174, 177\n, 43 S. Ct. 312. The objection to the jurisdiction over the corporation should have been sustained. As it was not waived by the later proceeding in the case, the judgment against this defendant is reversed, with directions to dismiss the action as to it. This reversal does not require that the judgment be reversed also as to Dickinson. Compare Camp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308, 317\n, 39 S. Ct. 478.\n Second. It is contended, on several grounds, that the statute violates the due process caluse. One ground is that the statute process clause. One ground is that the statute severally liable for the actual damages 'all persons deriving the benefit of said fraud.' Article 3973c. This provision is said to be unconstitutional. The argument is that thereby the state undertakes to fix a liability for damages regardless of participation in the wrong, so that where a corporation \n\n[273 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n has received the money arising from a fraudulent sale, every stockholder becomes liable for the tort, and that by making the liability joint and several, the statute makes one person liable for the wrong of another, although there was neither participation in nor ratification of it, nor even knowledge. At common law every member of a partnership is subject to such a liability (Strang v. Bradner, \n114 \nU.S. 555\n, 5 S. Ct. 1038; McIntyre v. Kavanaugh, \n142 \nU.S. 138, 139\n, 37 S. Ct. 38), and often stockholders of corporations are made similarly liable by statute. Compare Thomas v. Mattiessen, \n232 \nU.S. 221, 235\n, 34 S. Ct. 312; Buttner v. Adams (C. C. A.) 236 F. 105. The case presented by the pleadings and the evidence, so far as Dickinson is concerned, is, however, a very different one from that suggested. He is not sued as stockholder; and the count on the Texas statute does not charge him with full liability for the loss suffered, because as stockholder he received some benefit. It charges specifically that 'the defendants, and each of them, derived the benefit of the fraud and deceit.' And their liability is sought to be enforced primarily because 'they represented themselves to the plaintiff to be the owners' of the large tract of land, and cheated her 'through their authorized agents.' If Dickinson, either personally or through agents, made knowingly false statements with intent that the plaintiff should act upon them, his liability, either at common law or under the statute would not depend upon the receipt of any benefit by him. See Nevada Bank v. Portland Nat. Bank (C. C.) 59 F. 338; Hindman v. First Nat. Bank (C. C. A.) 112 F. 931, 944-945, 57 L. R. A. 108; Goldsmith v. Koopman (C. C.) 140 F. 616, 621; Talcott v. Friend (C. C. A.) 179 F. 676, 680, 4O L. R. A. (N. S.) 649. There was in the evidence ample support for a finding of such deception.\n Another contention is that the statute violates the due process clause in providing that actionable fraud shall exist, not only when there is 'a false representation of a past or existing material fact,' but also if there is a 'false \n\n[273 U.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n promise to do some act in the future, which is made as a material inducement to another party to enter into a contract and but for which promise said party would not have entered into said contract. ...' Article 3973a. The contention is groundless. To modify the substantive and procedural law so that recovery may be had in tort for a breach of contract, is well within the power of a state. An action for deceit was long the sole remedy for a breach of warranty, and it still lies in some jurisdictions. See F. L. Grant Shoe Co. v. Laid, \n212 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 29 S. Ct. 332; Nash v. Minn. Ins. & Trust Co., 163 Mass. 574, 587, 40 N. E. 1039, 28 L. R. A. 753, 47 Am. St. Rep. 489; Carter v. Glass, 44 Mich. 154, 6 N. W. 200, 38 Am. Rep. 240. Recovery in contract on a tort that is waived is common. See Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176, 194\n, 25 S. Ct. 9. Here, moreover, no such change is brought about by the statute. Some courts have long recognized that a false promise is a species of false representation for which there is remedy in tort (Church v. Swetland (C. C. A.) 243 F. 289, 294-295; Wright v. Barnard (D. C.) 248 F. 756, 775), as, for instance, where goods are obtained on credit by a purchaser who does not intend to pay for them. See Burrill v. Stevens, 73 Me. 395, 40 Am. Rep. 366; Stewart v. Emerson, 52 N. H. 301.\n It is also contended that the statute violates the due process clause by providing that whenever a promise thus made has not been complied with by the party making it within a reasonable time, 'it shall be presumed that it was falsely and fraudulently made, and the burden shall be on the party making it to show that it was made in good faith but was prevented from complying therewith by the act of God, the public enemy or by some equitable reason.' Article 3973a. This contention also is groundless. It is well settled that a state may consider proof of one fact presumptive evidence of another, if there is a rational connection between them (Hawes v. Georgia, \n258 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 42 S. Ct. 204), and also that it may change the burden of proof (Minn. & St. L. R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n193 \nU.S. 53\n, 24 S. Ct. 396). Moreover, \n\n[273 U.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n the lower court gave no charge based upon this provision of the statute. And it is at least doubtful whether this provision should be construed as applying to actions brought outside Texas. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Third. It is claimed that the Texas statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it applies only to fraud in transactions involving the purchase of real estate or of stock in a corporation or joint-stock company. The contention is clearly unfounded. A statute does not violate the equal protection clause merely because it is not all-embracing. Zucht v. King, \n260 \nU.S. 174, 177\n, 43 S. Ct. 24. A state may direct its legislation against what it deems an existing evil, without covering the whole field or possible abuses. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n262 \nU.S. 649, 661\n, 43 S. Ct. 651, 30 A. L. R. 635. The occasion of the legislation is indicated by the urgency provision of the statute which recites 'that there are now in this state a number of fraudulent land schemes and that a great number of citizens of this state have been defrauded thereby.'\n Fourth. It is urged that a federal court for Illinois should not enforce the liability under the Texas statute, because Illinois has not enacted a statute of similar import. The general rule is that one state will enforce a cause of action arising under the laws of another; that a federal court of any district will enforce a cause of action arising under the law of any state; but that ordinarily the courts of one government will not enforce the penal laws of another. The argument is that the Texas statute is a penal law, because it provides:\n'All persons knowingly \n\n[273 U.S. 119, 126]\n\u00a0\n and willfully making such false representations or promises or knowingly taking the advantage of said fraud shall be liable in exemplary damages to the person defrauded in such amount as shall be assessed by the jury, not to exceed double the amount of the actual damages suffered.' Article 3973c.\n\n Exemplary damages are recoverable at common law in many states. A statute providing for their recovery by and for injured party is U. S. 657, 666-683, 13 S. Ct. 224 36 L. Ed. U. S. 657, 666-683, 13 S. Ct. 224. Compare Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. v. Nichols, \n264 \nU.S. 348, 350\n, 351 S., 44 S. Ct. 353. No reason appears why the cause of action arising under the Texas statute should not be enforced in Illinois. The Texas statute as applied in this case does not add any extraordinary feature to the common law liability for fraudulent representations. There is nothing in the public policy of Illinois with which the statutory cause of action is inconsistent. It is not shown that substantial justice between the parties cannot be done consistenlty with the forms of procedure and the partice of the federal courts for Illinois.\n Reversed as to James-Dickinson Farm Mortgage Company.\n Affirmed as to A.

Davisson, of Ardmore, Okl., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. F. Semple, of Durant, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This controversy concerns title to lands allotted after her death to Emma Patterson, a Choctaw Indian. Once \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 546]\n\u00a0\n within the Southern judicial district of Indian Territory, they are now in Murray, Stephens, and Carter counties, Oklahoma. By original complaint presented to the Murray county district court, February 21, 1920, respondents here-William M. Patterson, surviving husband of Mrs. Patterson, and their five children-alleged that, although petitioner, U. Sherman Joines, had held actual and peaceful possession of the lands since July 5, 1907, the legal title thereto was in them, and they asked an appropriate decree establishing their rights.\n Mrs. Patterson, resident of the Central judicial district, Indian Territory, died there May 14, 1906, leaving five minor children, born, respectively, 1894, 1897, 1900, 1903, and 1905. Her surviving husband, father of these children and a white man, was appointed guardian for them by the United States Court, Central District, sitting at Durant (now in Bryan county, Oklahoma). Thereafter, April 24, 1907, he petitioned the United States Court for the Southern District, sitting at Ardmore (now in Carter county, Oklahoma), to sell the lands. May 2, 1907, that court authorized the sale, and on the following October 8 the guardian filed his report, showing sale of them at public outcry July 5, 1907, for $2,000 to U. Sherman Joines, petitioner here, the highest bidder. He also stated that, acting as their guardian, he had conveyed to Joines all interest of the minors in the lands.\n October 5, 1907, purporting to act as guardian, Patterson undertook by deed to convey to Joines all the minors' interest in the lands. Since then Joines had held open and adverse possession.\n July 14, 1913, the county court, Carter county, Oklahoma, after reciting its succession to the United States Court sitting at Ardmore, undertook to confirm the sale made in 1907. August 5, 1913, Patterson, purporting to act as guardian, again undertook by deed to convey to \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 547]\n\u00a0\n petitioner the minors' right, title, and interest in and to the lands. This deed recited the court proceedings during 1907 and the guardian's action thereunder, including his report of sale; also the 1913 order of confirmation by the Carter county court. It further stated that court was 'authorized to be any and all things herein which the said United States Court for the Southern District of the Indian Territory, sitting at Ardmore, could have done.'\n The district court for Murray county heard the present cause without a jury upon an agreed statement of facts, and held-\n The William M. Patterson acquired a life estate by curtesy in the lands, which had been barred by the seven-year statute of limitations in force within Indian Territory October 5, 1907\n\n\n That by putting Joines into possession of the lands, and allowing him to retain this for 14 years without complaint, Patterson estopped himself from asserting any claim thereto.\n That the United States Court for the Southern District of Indian Territory had jurisdiction to authorize sale by the guardian of the minor's interest, and confirmation thereof by the county court, Carter county, Oklahoma, was not void.\n That the adult children and heirs are barred by the statute of limitations from asserting any claim to the lands.\n An appropriate decree adjudging the issues for Joines followed.\n Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma first upheld the trial court; but, after a rehearing, it disapproved all the abovestated conclusions, reversed the judgment, and directed final decree for respondents here. Patterson v. Joines, 114 Okl. 9, 244 P. 585.\n The Supreme Court accepted and acted upon at least two conclusions which we think are erroneous: (1) That the proceeding in the United States Court at Ard more \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 548]\n\u00a0\n to sell the lands was merely ancillary to the main guardianship matter at Durant, in the Central district, and therefore should have been transferred to Bryan, not to Carter, county. (2) That the Arkansas seven- year statute of limitations-section 4471, Mansfield's Digest-did not commence to run against William M. Patterson and in favor of Joines when the latter took possession, since no interest passed to him; the court proceedings and the guardian's deed being wholly insufficient to give even color of title. These conclusions were based upon questions of federal law wrongly determined. They were acted upon by the court below. We must therefore reverse its judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings. See Whitehead v. Galloway, \n249 \nU.S. 79\n, 39 S. Ct. 206.\n Section 30, Act of May 2, 1890, c. 182, 26 Stat. 81, 94, as amended by the Act of March 1, 1895, c. 145, 28 Stat. 693, divided Indian Territory into three judicial districts-Northern, Certral, and Southern- and defined their limits. Section 31 extended over it certain general laws of Arkansas as published in Mansfield's Digest. Among these were chapters 20, 49, 73, and 97, relating, respectively, to the common and statute law of England, descent and distribution, guardians, curators and wards, and limitations.\n Section 32 of the same act provided that 'county,' in the laws of Arkansas so extended, should mean judicial division (afterwards district), and 'Indian Territory' might be substituted for 'state of Arkansas.'\n Section 22, Act of Congress approved July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641, 643-the Choctaw-Chickasaw Supplemental Agreement-provided:\n'If any person whose name appears upon the rolls, prepared as herein provided, shall have died subsequent to the ratification of this agreement and before receiving his allotment of land the lands to which such person would have been entitled if living shall be allotted in his name, and shall, \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 549]\n\u00a0\n together with his proportionate share of other tribal property, descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution as provided in chapter forty-nine of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas: Provided, that the allotment thus to be made shall be selected by a duly appointed administrator or executor.'\n\n When extended over Indian Territory, the specified laws of Arkansas Carried the settled constructions placed upon them by courts of that state. So construed, they became, in effect, laws of the United States as though originally enacted by Congress for government of the territory. Willis v.

That all causes, proceedings, and matters, civil or criminal, pending in the district courts of Oklahoma Territory, or in the United States Courts in the Indian Territory, at the time said territories become a state, not ransferred to the United States Circuit or District Courts in the state of Oklahoma, shall be proceeded \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 550]\n\u00a0\n with, held and determined by the courts of said state, the successors of said district courts of the territory of Oklahoma, and the United States Courts in the Indian Territory; with the right to prosecute appeals or writs of error to the supreme or appellate court of said state, and also with the same right to prosecute appeals or writs of error from the final determination in such cases made by the supreme or appellate court of such state to the Supreme Court of the United States, as is provided by law for appeals and writs of error from the supreme (or) final appellate court of a state to the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n\n The Constitution of Oklahoma provides:\n'Section 1 ('Schedule'). No existing rights, actions, suits, proceedings, contracts, or claims shall be affected by the change in the forms of government, but all shall continue as if no change in the forms of government had taken place. And all processes which may have been issued previous to the admission of the state into the Union under the authority of the territory of Oklahoma or under the authority of the laws in force in the Indian Territory shall be as valid as if issued in the name of the state.\n\n'Sec. 2. ... All laws in force in the territory of Oklahoma at the time of the admission of the state into the Union, which are not repugnant to this constitution, and which are not locally inapplicable, shall be extended to and remain in force in the state of Oklahoma until they expire by their own limitation or are altered or repealed by law.'\n\n'Section 23. When this Constitution shall go into effect, the books, records, papers, and proceedings of the probate court in each county, and all causes and matters of administration and guardianship, and other matters pending therein, shall be transferred to the county court of such county, except of Day county, which shall be \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 551]\n\u00a0\n transferred to the county court of Ellis county, and the county courts of the respective counties shall proceed to final decree or judgment, order, or other termination in the said several matters and causes as the said probate court might have done if this constitution had not been adopted. The district court of any county, the successor of the United States Court for the Indian Territory, in each of the Counties formed in whole or in part in the Indian Territory, shall transfer to the county court of such county all matters, proceedings, records, books, papers, and documents appertaining to all causes or proceedings relating to estates: Provided, that the Legislature may provide for the transfer of any of said matters and causes to another county than herein prescribed.'\n\n Section 3509, Mansfield's Digest:\n'When it shall appear that it would be for the benefit of a ward that his real estate, or any part thereof, be sold or leased and the proceeds put on interest, or invested in productive stocks, or in other real estate, his guardian or curator may sell or lease the same accordingly upon obtaining an order for such sale or lease from the court of probate of the county in which such real estate or the greater part thereof shall be situate.'\n\n Sections 3510 and 3511 prescribe the procedure for such causes.\n Reid et al. v. Hart, 45 Ark. 41, 46, 48 (1885), distinctly holds that the court of the county wherein lies real estate belonging to a ward is the proper tribunal to entertain an application for its sale by his guardian. The opinion declares:\n'There had, however, been provisions made for the sale of lands, on the application of administrators and executors, for the payment of debts. They were adopted early in our state history, being found in the Revised Code (section 147), and remained in force until the adoption of the Civil Code of 1868. They required that the application for such an order should be made to the probate court of the county in which the lands are situate. The \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 552]\n\u00a0\n Act of December 23, 1846, enlarged the scope of purposes for which such sales might be made, and associated 'guardians' with personal representatives (ubisupra) but made no change as to the tribunal. It may fairly be inferred that, by this association, the Legislature contemplated that guardians should conform to the same rule, and make their applications for the sale of lands in the county where they lay . ... This is law to this day, and has been brought forward into Mansfield's Digest,  3509. This displays a system by which we endeavor to supply the omission in the act of 1846, which fails to designate the probate court meant, by reasoning from the organic unity of the whole system.'\n\n And see MaHarry v. Eatman, 29 Okl. 46, 53, 116 P. 935.\n Under the statute thus construed, the court for the Southern judicial district, Indian Territory, at Ardmore, had jurisdiction of the guardian's petition to sell. The cause there was not merely ancillary to the original guardian proceeding in the Central district, wherein Patterson was appointed. It had the status of an independent suit.\n The Enabling Act directed that causes pending in the United States Courts for Indian Territory should be proceeded with and determined by the successor courts of Oklahoma. As we understand the opinion below, the court recognized that, if the guardian's suit for sale, begun at Ardmore, was an original and independent one, transfer of it to the Carter county court for further action was proper. We think it was an original proceeding, and therefore was transferred to the proper court for further action according to the rights of the parties. See Dewalt v. Cline, 35 Okl. 197, 128 P. 121, and Bailey v. Jones, 96 Okl. 56, 220 P. 345.\n Joines went into open, peaceful possession of the allotted lands October 5, 1907, when the following parts of chapter 97, Mansfield's Digest, were in force:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 544, 553]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 4471. No person or persons, or their heirs, shall have, sue or maintain any action or suit, either in law or equity, for any lands, tenements or hereditaments but within seven years next after his, her or their right to commence, have or maintain such suit shall have come, fallen or accrued; and all suits, either in law or equity, for the recovery of any lands, tenements or hereditaments shall be had and sued within seven years next after title or cause of action accrued, and no time after said seven years shall have passed. ...\n'Sec. 4476. No action for the recovery of real property, when the plaintiff does not claim title to the lands, shall be brought to maintained when the plaintiff, or his testator or intestate, has been five years out of possession.'\n\n Under the settled construction given to the seven-year statute of limitations by the courts of Arkansas, it began to run against Patterson when Joines took possession. 'So long as a man is in possession of land, claiming title, however wrongfully, and with whatever degree of knowledge that he had no right, so long the real owner is out of possession, in a constructive as well as an actual sense. It is of the nature of the statute of limitation, when applied to civil actions, in effect, to mature a wrong into a right, by cutting off the remedy. To warrant its application in ejectment, the books require color of title, by deed or other documental semblance of right in the defendant, only when the defense is founded on a constructive adverse possession. But neither a deed nor any equivalent muniment is necessary, where the possession is indicated by actual occupation, and any other evidence of an adverse claim exists. The muniment is but one circumstance by which to make out an adverse possession.' Ferguson v. Peden, 33 Ark. 150, 155; Jacks v. Chaffin et al. (1879) 34 Ark. 534, 541; Logan et al. v. Jelks, 34 Ark. 547, 549. \n\n[274 U.S. 544, 554]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Oklahoma seems definitely to have approved the doctrine that rights of action arising in Indian Territory prior to statehood remained subject to the Arkansas statute of limitations. Patterson v. Rousney, 58 Okl. 185, 202, 159 P. 636; Davis v. Foley, 60 Okl. 87, 88, 159 P. 646. And see U. S. Fidelity, etc., Co. v. Fidelity Trust Co ., 49 Okl. 398, 408, 153 P. 195; Sandlin et al. v. Barker, 95 Okl. 113, 117, 218 P. 519.\n Considering our conclusions in respect of the two federal questions already dealt with and views long accepted by the court below, it seems unnecessary for us now to consider other points relied on by counsel.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES v. PRAIRIE OIL & GAS CO.(1927)\nNo. 109\nArgued: January 11, 1927Decided: January 24, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. A. Atkins and Carter W. Wesley, both of Muskogee, Okl., and James A. Cobb, of Washington, D. C., for appellants. \n\n[273 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. L. Hull and Nathan A. Gibson, both of Tulsa, Okl., and Thomas D. Flannelly, and Paul B. Mason, both of Independence, Kan., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity seeking the cancellation of oil and gas leases to, or held by, the Prairie Oil & Gas Company, and for an account. The fundamental facts are as follows. Leonard D. Ingram was a member of the Muskogee (Creek) Nation and as such on July 1, 1907, received patents of homestead and other land the homestead patent expressing the conditions provided by Act of Congress, that the land should be inalienable, etc., for twenty-one years. On January 3, 1911, the County Court of Wagoner County, Oklahoma, made an order appointing Minerva Ingram, now Minerva Jones, guardian of Leonard D. Ingram. On January 24, 1911, March 28, 1911, and December 18, 1911, Minerva Ingram, acting as guardian, made the leases in question, covering the above lands and running for as long after the minority of Leonard Ingram as oil or gas should be found in paying quantities. The defendant company began to remove oil and gas in 1920 and is continuing to do so still. The leases are said to be invalid for several reasons: It is alleged that the appointment of Minerva Ingram as guardian was void under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution because no notice of the application for appointment was given. It is alleged further that the guardian had no power to execute leases that would or might outlast the minority of the ward, as that again is thought to be contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Thirdly it is urged that the inclusion of the homestead was invalid because of the condition against alienation in the patent under the Act of Congress, notwithstanding the later Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199; 35 Stat. 312, which is admitted to apply but is said to be ineffective under the Fifth Amendment, as depriving the minor of his property without due process of law. Finally it is averred that the leases were not executed in manner and form required by \n\n[273 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n law. On motion the District Court dismissed the bill and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court. Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557, 560\n, 42 S. Ct. 549\n\n\n The averment that the guardian was appointed without notice was qualified by an amendment showing an order for a hearing on January 3, 1911, and for notice by posting in three public places, one being the door of the Court House. The notice was posted as directed but although dated December 15, 1910, states January 3, 1910, instead of 1911 as the time for the hearing. It was also sent by mail to the minor, to Minerva Ingram and three others, stated to be next of kin and persons having the care of the minor. It is admitted that Minerva Ingram was the mother of the minor, and the record indicates that the latter was of tender years, or at least under twelve, which is not denied. The mother seems to have had him in her custody. The Oklahoma statutes only require such notice as the judge deems reasonable to be given to the relative residing in the county and to any person having the care of such minor. Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921,  1431. In the circumstances stated, unqualified, the requirement of notice is merely formal, if it exists. Lester v. Smith, 86 Okl. 143, 200 P. 780; Gibson, Appellant, 154 Mass. 378, 379-381, 28 N. E. 296. Certainly there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States that requires it. See Hoyt v. Sprague, \n103 U.S. 613\n. The clerical error in the notice would mislead no one and did not invalidate the proceedings. The mother was the petitioner and no one but the mother and son was concerned. We see nothing to overcome the presumption if any presumption were needed, in favor of the validity of the appointment declared to exist by the Supreme Court of the state. Baker v. Cureton, 49 Okl. 15, 150 P. 1090.\n The Oklahoma statutes are held to give to guardians the power to execute oil and gas leases that may last beyond the minority of their wards. Cabin Valley Min- \n\n[273 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n ing Co. v. Hall, 53 Okl. 760, 155 P. 570, L. R. A. 1916F, 493; Mallen v. Ruth Oil Co. (D. C.) 230 F. 497, affirmed (C. C. A.) 231 F. 845. The fugitive character of the subject-matter makes it necessary in the ward's interest that guardians should have that power, and it appears to us that it would be an extravagant interpretation of the Constitution to hold that the ward's interest must be sacrificed on the ground of the absolute character of his title when adult. He takes that title subject to such qualifications as the law reasonably allows to be imposed for his good. The denial of the power as to agricultural (Haddock v. Bronaugh, 92 Okl. 197, 218 P. 848) or coal lands (Tierney Coal Co. v. Smith, 180 Ky. 815, 203 S. W. 731, 4 A. L. R. 1540), whether right or wrong on constitutional grounds, cannot be extended to this case.\n It is not open to dispute that the removal by the later Act of Congress that we have cited of the restriction upon alienation previously imposed is valid. Williams v. Johnson, \n239 \nU.S. 414, 420\n, 36 S. Ct. 150; Egan v. McDonald, \n246 \nU.S. 227, 229\n, 38 S. Ct. 223; Fink v. County Commissioners, \n248 \nU.S. 399, 404\n, 39 S. Ct. 128.\n It is admitted that if we follow the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, both those that we have cited and others, the guardian did not have to follow the procedure prescribed for the sale of a ward's real estate. Duff v. Keaton, 33 Okl. 92, 124 P. 291, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 472; Papoose Oil Co. v. Swindler, 95 Okl. 264, 221 P. 506. See, also, Jackson v. Gates Oil Co. (C. C. A.) 297 F. 549; Clayton v. Tibbens (C. C. A.) 298 F. 18, affirming (D. C.) 288 F. 393. But it is argued here that under Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, 30 S. Ct. 140, this Court is not bound by the State decisions and may judge for itself, inasmuch as whatever may be the rule of property now, Duff v. Keaton was decided after these leases were made. It would seem from the cases cited that the present rule had been followed and great interest established on the faith of it before Duff v. Keaton. But apart from that consideration no case yet has gone to the length of undertaking \n\n[273 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n to correct the construction of State laws by State courts. The exclusive authority to enact those laws carries with it final authority to say what they mean. The construction of those laws by the Supreme Court of the State is as much the act of the State, as the enactment of them by the Legislature. If we thought the decisions cited far more questionable than we do, we nevertheless should bow to them as binding upon a matter of local administration and of only local concern. The counsel for the appellants presented a very thorough and well stated argument, but failed to make us doubt that the decree must be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKADOW v. PAUL(1927)\nNo. 241\nArgued: March 16, 1927Decided: April 18, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 175, 176]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. D. Angell, of Portland, Or., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. A. L. Miller, of Vancouver, Wash., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to a decree of the Supreme Court of Washington. The original action was brought in the superior court of Clarke county, of that state, to have the proceedings in the organization of diking improvement district No. 3 of that county declared void, because certain portions of the statute under which the district was formed were unconstitutional, and to restrain the defendants from taking any steps looking to the construction of the proposed improvement or the sale by the county of bonds to finance it. After a trial on the merits the trial court dismissed the petition, and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the state, where the \n\n[274 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n decree of the trial court was affirmed. The proposed improvement was sought to be made under chapter 6, title 27, Rem. Comp. Stat. as amended by chapter of the Laws of 1923. This law by sections 4407, 4408, 4410, 4411, 4412, 4414, 4415, 4416, 4422, 4435-1, makes provision for the establishment of a diking district initiated by a petition addressed to the board of county commissioners of the county in which the improvement is located, signed by certain owners of property to be benefited, the petition to set forth with reasonable certainty the location, route and terminal of the dike. Thereafter the usual provisions are made for the giving of notice, the hearing upon the question of the wisdom and public benefit of the improvement, an estimate of the damage to each landowner which may be done by the improvement and also of the benefits it will effect for each and the total number of acres that will be benefited. The county commissioners are to have the aid of the county engineer. The proposed improvement is to be approved by the state reclamation board. Full provision is made for hearings at which the damages and the benefits shall be determined and apportioned to the various landowners and for appeals to a court in such determinations. A board of supervisors of the district are elected who attend to the construction of the improvement. The cost of the improvement is to be paid by assessment upon the property benefited, and all the lands included within the boundaries of the district and assessed for the improvement are to remain liable for the costs of the improvement until the same are fully paid. One permitted method of meeting the cost is by bonds. These are not to be obligations of the county, though they are issued by it.\n The object of this particular improvement was to reclaim lands on the east bank of the Columbia river \n\n[274 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n which were swampy and subject to overflow at times of high water. It also had for its purpose the draining of Lake Shillapoo. The first petition covered 6,500 acres. After the organization of the district proceeded to the point where bonds were ready to be sold, it was permitted to remain dormant for three years when a second petition was filed with the county commissioners and thereafter the district was regularly established, comprising 5,100 acres of land. It was determined that the project should be financed by the issuing of bonds to run for fifteen years. The commissioners advertised for the letting of the contract for the improvement and for the sale of the bonds. On the day before the date set, the plaintiffs in error began the present action. In the state court there were many objections to the validity of the proceedings, and all of them were decided against the plaintiffs.\n The counsel for plaintiffs in error in this court concede that the only point which they can press here grows out of an amendment to the diking law (section 4439-6 of Session Laws of Washington for 1923, pp. 128, 129) with reference to reassessments. It reads as follows:\n'If upon the foreclosure of the assessment upon any property the same shall not sell for enough to pay the assessment against it, or if any property assessed was not subject to assessment, or if any assessment made shall have been eliminated by foreclosure of a tax lien or made void in any other manner, the board of county commissioners shall cause a supplemental assessment to be made on the property benefited by the improvement, including property upon which any assessment shall have been so eliminated or made void, and against the county, cities and towns chargeable therewith in the manner provided for the original assessment, to cover the deficiency so caused in the original assessment.\n\n The italicized words were put in by the amendment in 1923\n\n\n It is argued for plaintiffs in error that by this statute it is attempted to give power to the county officers upon \n\n[274 U.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n the foreclosure of the assessment upon any property to reassess the deficit upon the remaining lands in the district, and that this permits them, to ignore the original apportionment and to reassess lands within the district for the remainder of the cost of the improvement, the benefit of which inures to other lands in the district; that this violates the principle that assessments must be apportioned in accordance with the benefits received and is not due process of law. It is said that this complaint is particularly pertinent to the case at bar for the reason that a large area of the diking district involved, comprising the bottom of Shallipoo Lake and contiguous low lands bordering it, the value of which is nothing at the present time, and the value of which may continue to be nothing after the system of improvement is established, for the reason that it has not been ascertained that the bed of the lake and the low lands surrounding it are of such composition as to permit their use for agricultural purposes even after they are drained, that if such lands prove valueless, it follows that the assessment charges against the same will not be paid and by the reassessment provision the cost thereof will be reassessed against the remaining land in the district, which will increase the cost to such lands far in excess of the benefits received. In answering the objection that the condition feared has not yet arisen, is premature and may never arise and that such owners can apply for relief when conditions arise making it necessary, it is said that the bonds in question, the issuing of which the plaintiffs in error are seeking to have enjoined, are to be sold under the provisions of this law with the reassessment feature as a part thereof and that they become at once a cloud upon the title of plaintiffs, make it unmarketable and to that extent tend to confiscate their property and work a taking without due process of law. It is said that if the reassessment feature violates the federal Constitution, a court of equity should afford relief at the outset to the landowners within the district. \n\n[274 U.S. 175, 180]\n\u00a0\n The diking act specifically provides (section 4422, Session Laws of Washington for 1923, p. 114) that the cost of the improvement shall be paid by assessment upon the property benefited, said assessment to be levied and apportioned as thereinafter prescribed. In Foster v. Commissioners of Cowlitz County, 100 Wash. 502, 171 P. 539, the Supreme Court of the state, in discussing a similar objection under this act, though it has since been amended in one respect, used this language:\n'In so far as the question of due process in the charging of the cost of the improvement to the property benefited thereby is concerned, counsel's contention is also untenable. Owners of property within the district are given notice and opportunity to be heard upon the question of the creation of the district and the construction of the improvement. When it comes to charging the cost of the improvement against the several tracts of land within the district, such charge must be 'in proportion to the benefits accruing thereto,' and we think the statute also means that no tract of land can be charged in excess of the benefits accruing thereto. Owners of land within the district to be charged with any portion of the cost of the improvement are given notice and opportunity to be heard upon the question of benefits and the apportionment of the charge to be made therefor against the several tracts. Not until all this is done is the assessment finally levied.'\n\n It is said that this language of the Washington court cannot now be regarded as a limitation to benefits of assessments against any particular lot of land because of the amendment of 1923 already referred to by which the supplemental assessments may include deficits in the total assessments occasioned by elimination or voiding of previous assessments on the other lands in the district.\n It seems clear to us that there is nothing in this amendment which changes the rule of construction of the statute as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Foster Case, \n\n[274 U.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n imposing a limitation in favor of the assessment payers against any supplemental assessment that should exceed the benefits conferred on each one by the improvement. Supplemental assessments in providing for the payment for such improvements are recognized as a legitimate part of the proceeding necessary to raise the money and to pay bonds issued to meet the cost, and if in the process of collection it shall appear that some of the assessed land fails to pay the assessment and is appropriated and sold, the distribution of the deficit thus arising to be included in another assessment is only meeting the to be expected cost of the improvement. When the operation of the law works uniformly as against all parts of the assessment district and results in a higher cost of the improvement, and an increased assessment on all the owners of land who have paid, it violates no constitutional right of theirs as long as their benefits continue respectively to exceed their individual assessments.

Moore, of Kansas City, Mo., and C. H. Lewis and J. D. Wilkinson, both of Shreveport, La., for petitioner.[ Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Ellzey \n275 U.S. 236\n (1927) ]\n\n\n[275 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. P. Jones, of Marshall, Tex., for respondent.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a United States deputy marshal, was assigned to guard Merchant, a telegraph lineman employed by petitioner, from violence by strikers. He went with Merchant to repair a telegraph line, and while returning with him on a motorcar over petitioner's railroad the car was derailed and respondent injured. Respondent brought the present suit in the District Court for Western Louisiana to recover his injuries. The trial by jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendant, the petitioner here. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ( Ellzey v. Kansas City Southern R. Co., 12 F.(2d) 4) reversed the judgment holding that an instruction to the jury by the trial judge was erroneous.\n There was evidence from which the jury could have found that the accident and injury were caused by the negligent operation of the motorcar by Merchant at a dangerously high rate of speed. There was also evidence from which it might have found that respondent contributed to his own injury either by urging Merchant to drive at excessive speed or by failing to object to Merchant's \n\n[275 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n obvious negligence. That part of the charge designated by the court below as erroneous is as follows:\n'If you should find that in this case the plaintiff urged, directed, or counseled the driver of the car to run it at a reckless and high rate of speed, and that as a result of such reckless running the car was injured, then that would be contributory negligence which would bar his recovery, or if he saw that the car was being negligently run, in such a manner as with the knowledge that he had before him at the time a man placed in his position must reasonably have known that to continue in the situation he was in was dangerous without protesting or desisting and removing himself from the perilous situation at the earliest possible moment, then that would be an act of omission which would contribute to the injury, and would in law constitute contributory negligence.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in holding this instruction improper, pointed out portions of the evidence indicating that respondent's conversations with Merchant, relied on to show that he urged or advised Merchant to drive the motorcar at a dangerous rate of speed, took place at Carson, and later at De Ridder, on petitioner's line, and that the accident occurred after leaving De Ridder, and while proceeding north from that point to Leesville. It pointed out, also, that under the quoted instruction the respondent could not have recovered if the jury found that he had voluntarily remained on the car after he saw it was being negligently run. The court considered this erroneous, saying:\n'Though the plaintiff was negligent in the respect stated, if, as evidence adduced indicated, the defendant's employee was aware of such negligence in time to have avoided the injury by the use of reasonable care, and he failed to use such care, that failure might be found to be the sole proximate cause of the injury, and plaintiff's negligence be deemed a remote cause.

The plaintiff's right to recover was not barred, if his negligence was only a remote cause of his injury, and Merchant's negligence was the sole proximate cause of it.'\n\n This language suggests that the Circuit Court of Appeals thought this case to be governed by the doctrine of the last clear chance. That doctrine, rightly applied in the Chunn Case, amounts to no more than this, that a negligent defendant will be held liable to a negligent plaintiff if the defendant, aware of the plaintiff's peril or unaware of it only through carelessness, had in fact a later opportunity than the plaintiff to avert an accident. Grand Trunk Ry. v. Ives, \n144 \nU.S. 408, 428\n, 12 S. Ct. 679; Inland & Seaboard Coasting Co. v. Tolson, \n139 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 11 S. Ct. 653. In the cases applying the rule the parties have been engaged in independent courses of negligent conduct. The classic instance is that in which the plaintiff had improvidently left his animal tied in a roadway where it was injured by the defendant's negligent operation of his vehicle. Davies v. Mann, 10 M. & W. 546. It rests on the assumption that he is the more culpable whose opportunity to avoid the injury was later.\n On the facts assumed by the Circuit Court of Appeals-that Merchant was driving the car reckleassly with respondent's encouragement or acquiescence-the respondent and Merchant were engaged in a common venture which, acting together, they were carrying on in a careless manner. In such a case their courses of conduct are not sufficiently independent to let it be said that either one or the other had in fact a later opportunity to avoid the consequences of their joint negligence. Compare St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. v. Schumacher, \n152 \nU.S. 77\n, 14 S. Ct. 479; Wheelock v. Clay (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 972; Kinney v. Chicago Great Western R. R. (C. C.) 17 F.(2d) 708; Denver City Tramway Co. v. Cobb (C. C. A.) 164 F. 41.\n We think that the doctrine of the last clear chance was not involved here. If the jury found negligence on the \n\n[275 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n part of the defendant then their verdict turned on whether they thought the respondent was guilty of contributory negligence. Whether the instructions were sufficient in this respect is the only substantial question before us. The trial judge charged generally in various forms that respondent's negligence, as a bar to recovery, must be found to have contributed 'proximately' to the injury, and that if respondent counseled Merchant to run the car at a reckless rate of speed and by reason of his encouragement Merchant negligently operated the car, and as a result of that negligent operation the injury occurred, 'or if he saw that the car was being negligently run, in such a manner as with the knowledge that he had before him at the time a man placed in his position must reasonably have known that to continue in the situation he was in was dangerous without protesting or desisting and removing himself from the perilous situation at the earliest possible moment, then that would be an act of omission which would contribute to the injury, and would in law constitute contributory negligence.' Again the jury was instructed that respondent 'would not be held to have assumed the risk of an injury resulting from the defendant's negligence merely because the plaintiff failed to interpose his judgment against that of the defendant, unless you find that a man of ordinary care and prudence, so situated, would have abandoned the car.'\n We think these instructions and others of similar import, read as we must read them in the light of the whole charge, were sufficiently favorable to the respondent on the subject of contributory negligence. Perhaps it would have been permissible to tell the jury that, though respondent had at an earlier moment encouraged or acquiesced in Merchant's recklessness, he might still recover if later and before the accident he repented and asked Merchant to drive carefully. But the court's failure to do so, in the absence of a specific request, seems to us not to be ground for reversal. \n\n[275 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n The respondent suggests here numerous other objections to the charge as given. We have considered them and find that they present no substantial question requiring further comment. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKELLEY v. STATE OF OREGON(1927)\nNo. 827\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Will R. King, of Portland, Or., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. John H. Carson, of Salem, Or., for the State of Oregon.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ellsworth Kelley, plaintiff in error, James Willos, and Tom Murray were jointly indicted by the grand jury of Marion county, Oregon, for the crime of murder in the \n\n[273 U.S. 589, 590]\n\u00a0\n first degree under the provisions of section 1893, Oregon Laws, as follows:\n'If any person shall purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, or in the commission or attempt to commit any rape, arson, robbery, or burglary, kill another, such person shall be deemed guilty of murder in the first degree.'\n\n At the time of the commission of the crime set forth in the indictment, Kelley and the two others accused with him were prisoners in the Oregon state penitentiary at Salem, Or., and the crime was committed by them in their escape from that institution. John Sweeney, named in the indictment, was a guard at the institution, and was slain in his attempt to prevent the escape.\n The plaintiff in error was arraigned upon the indictment in the manner prescribed by the laws of Oregon, and upon such arraignment he entered a plea of not guilty to the indictment. He and Willos were tried together. The cause came on regularly for trial. The jury returned into court a verdict of guilty as charged in the indictment without recommendation. On October 30, 1925, plaintiff in error was sentenced to pay the penalty of death as by the law provided. Judgment was entered on the same day. Appeal was taken by the plaintiff in error to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court (State v. Kelley, 118 Or. 397, 247 P. 146), and denied two petitions for rehearing. Thereupon the case came here upon writ of error allowed by the Chief Justice of the state Supreme Court.\n An examination of the record satisfies us that there is really no federal question in the case, and the errors assigned purporting to raise questions under the Constitution of the United States are frivolous. An example of these may be given in the assignment of error that the rights of the defendant under the federal Constitution were invaded by the charge of the court on the question \n\n[273 U.S. 589, 591]\n\u00a0\n of self-defense. It is difficult to see how in any aspect of it such a question could involve issues under the federal Constitution, and certainly they do not here.\n Another assignment of error is to the fact that the plaintiff in error was constantly in the custody of the warden of the penitentiary inside and outside of the courtroom, during the trial. It is argued that he was entitled to be free from any custody in order that he might fully make his defense and that this deprived him of due process. It is a new meaning attached to the requirement of due process of law that one who is serving in the penitentiary for a felony and while there commits a capital offense must, in order to secure a fair trial, be entirely freed from custody. Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 \nU.S. 254, 265\n, 42 S. Ct. 309, 22 A. L. R. 879; State v. Wilson, 38 Conn. 126. There is no showing that he had not full opportunity to consult with counsel or that he was in any way prevented from securing needed witnesses. The assignment is wholly without merit.\n Finally, it is objected that as the plaintiff in error was under sentence to confinement in the penitentiary for 20 years, which had not expired when he committed this murder, he could not be executed until he had served his full term.\n Answering this objection, the Supreme Court of Oregon said:\n'As stated, the defendants are both convicts imprisoned in the Oregon state penitentiary and it seems from the testimony that they had escaped from prison in other jurisdictions. The defendants claim that the sentence of death imposed upon them by the judgment of the court is forbidden by section 1576, Or. L., reading thus:\n\n\"If the defendant is convicted of two or more crimes, before judgment on either, the judgment must be that the imprisonment upon any one may commence at the expiration of the imprisonment upon any other of such crimes; and if the defendant be in imprisonment upon a \n\n[273 U.S. 589, 592]\n\u00a0\n previous judgment on a conviction for a crime, the judgment must be that the imprisonment must commence at the expiration of the term limited by such previous judgment.'\n\n'Their theory seems to be that owing to the fact that each of them being then under sentence to imprisonment for other offenses, the trial court had no jurisdiction to punish them for a crime committed while the pending imprisonment was in force. It will be noted that the section just quoted refers only to imprisonment and not to the penalty of death or fine. The section does not purport to exempt a defendant from trial and judgment for the commission of any crime during his confinement in the penitentiary. It would be shocking to all sense of justice and public security to say that a criminal confined in the penitentiary as punishment for his misdeeds could be licensed to commit other crimes with immunity; yet, that is the conclusion to which the argument of the defendants' counsel will lead. If the jury had found such a verdict as would authorize their imprisonment, the section quoted would be the authority for the court to declare, that the latest imprisonment should begin at the expiration of the term then being served by the defendants. The punishment of death is an entirely distinctive thing and is not included in the provisions of this section.'\n\n It is contended that this construction of the statute in permitting one who has committed a murder while a convict in the penitentiary to be executed before his term has expired deprives him of a right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, in that due process of law secures to him as a privilege the serving out of his sentence before he shall be executed. It is doubtful whether this exception and assignment can be said to be directed to a ruling of the Supreme Court of Oregon such as to draw in question the validity of a statute of Oregon on the ground of its repugnancy to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the \n\n[273 U.S. 589, 593]\n\u00a0\n United States and sustain it, as required in section 237a of the Judicial Code as amended, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 937 (Comp. St.  1214), permitting a writ of error. But, assuming that it does, or, if not, treating the writ of error as an application for certiorari, there is not the slightest ground for sustaining the assignment.\n A prisoner may certainly be tried, convicted, and sentenced for another crime, committed either prior to or during his imprisonment, and may suffer capital punishment and be executed during the term. The penitentiary is no sanctuary, and life in it does not confer immunity from capital punishment provided by law. He has no vested constitutional right to serve out his unexpired sentence.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 705\nArgued: January 19, 1927Decided: May 2, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William E. Leahy and William J. Hughes, Jr., both of Washington, D. C. (Mesrs. Edward J. Callahan, George R. Smith, and Wm. B. Movery, all of Minneapolis, Minn., Paul Jones and Paul Jones, Jr., both of Texarkana, Ark., H. C. Wade, of Fort Worth, Tex., and Samuel B. Wilson, Jr ., of Mankato, Minn., of counsel), for petitioner.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., William J. Donovan, Asst. Atty. Gen., and William D. Whitney, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was indicted in the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas under section 215 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10385) for using the mails to defraud. He pleaded guilty, and thereupon the court sentenced him to the penitentiary for three years. Afterwards he filed a petition alleging that he was induced so to plead by the promise of one of the prosecuting attorneys to recommend to the court that he be punished by sentence of three months in jail and by fine of $1,000, and by the statement of such attorney that the court would impose that sentence. The petition asserted that the sentence given was excessive and prayed to have it set aside and the punishment alleged to have been promised substituted. The United States denied the allegations of the petition. After hearing evidence on the issue, the court declined so to change the sentence, but, on petitioner's motion, set aside the judgment and allowed him to withdraw his plea of guilty and to plead not guilty. At the trial the court, against objection by petitioner, permitted the prosecution as a \n\n[274 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n part of its case in chief to put in evidence a certified copy of the plea of guilty. The petitioner in defense introduced the court's order setting aside the sentence and granting leave to withdraw that plea. Then both sides gave evidence as to matters considered by the court in setting aside the conviction. The court charged the jury:\n'The plea of guilty is introduced as evidence by the government. ... If you find that Mr. Kercheval made that plea of guilty and that no promise was held out to him for the purpose of getting him to make that plea, or if you find that he was notified before he made the plea that nothing that was ever said to him with reference to it theretofore would be met, then it is evidence for you to consider in connection with the other evidence in the case. If ... you find that he was deceived, that this was brought about by conversations that he had had with reference to it, and that he made that plea of guilty when as a matter of fact he was not guilty, then you will disregard that particular part of it and consider just the other testimony in the case.'\n\n The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the court sentenced petitioner to the penitentiary for three years. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 12 F.(2d) 904. It said (page 907):\n'In the motion made by defendant to set aside the judgment he admits that he had pleaded guilty. The purpose was to reduce the punishment, but if this failed he asked to withdraw his plea, and that the judgment be set aside. We know of no reason why the plea of guilty was not admissible under all these circumstances for what it might be worth. It was not conclusive of guilt, and the court so instructed the jury. The defendant probably knew better than any one else whether or not be was guilty. Under the evidence in this case a plea of guilty upon his part would have seemed a very reasonable thing. We see no substantial or prejudicial error in the admission of any of \n\n[274 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n the evidence complained of.'\n\n The case is here on certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 685\n, 47 S. Ct. 244, 71 L. Ed. -.\n In support of the rulings below, the United States cites Commonwealth v. Ervine, 8 Dana (Ky.) 30, People v. Jacobs, 165 App. Div. 721, 151 N. Y. S. 522, State v. Carta, 90 Conn. 79, 96 A. 411, L. R. A. 1916E, 634, People v. Boyd, 67 Cal. App. 292, 302, 227 P. 783, and People v. Steinmetz, 240 N. Y. 411, 148 N. E. 597. The arguments for admissibility to be gleaned from these cases are that the introduction of the withdrawn plea shows conduct inconsistent with the claim of innocence at the trial; that the plea is a statement of guilt having the same effect as if made out of court; that it is received on the principle which permits a confession of the accused in a lower court to be shown against him at his trial in the higher court; that it is not received as conclusive, and, like an extrajudicial confession, is not sufficient without other evidence of the corpus delicti. It is sometimes likened to prior testimony of the defendant making in favor of the prosecution.\n Other decisions support the petitioner's contention that a plea of guilty withdrawn by leave of court is not admissible on the trial of the issue arising on the substituted plea of not guilty. Heim v. United States, 47 App. D. C. 485, L. R. A. 1918E, 87; State v. Meyers, 99 Mo. 107, 119, 12 S. W. 516; People v. Ryan, 82 Cal. 617, 23 P. 121; Heath v. State (Okl. Cr. App.) 214 P. 1091. And see White v. State, 51 Ga. 286, 289; Green v. State, 40 Fla. 474, 478, 24 So. 537. We think that contention is sound. A plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extrajudicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence. Out of just consideration for persons accused of crime, courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences. When one so pleads \n\n[274 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n he may be held bound. United States v. Bayaud (C. C.) 23 F. 721. But, on timely application, the court will vacate a plea of guilty shown to have been unfairly obtained or given through ignorance, fear or inadvertence. Such an application does not involve any question of guilt or innocence. Commonwealth v. Crapo, 212 Mass. 209, 98 N. E. 702. The court in exercise of its discretion will permit one accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial if for any reason the granting of the privilege seems fair and just. Swang v. State, 2 Cold. (Tenn.) 212, 88 Am. Dec. 593; State v. Maresca, 85 Conn. 509, 83 A. 635; State v. Nicholas, 46 Mont. 470, 472, 128 P. 543; State v. Stephens, 71 Mo. 535; People v. McCrory, 41 Cal. 458, 461; State v. Coston, 113 La. 717, 720, 37 So. 619; Bishop's New Criminal Procedure,  747.\n The effect of the court's order permitting the withdrawal was to adjudge that the plea of guilty be held for naught. It subsequent use as evidence against petitioner was in direct conflict with that determination. When the plea was annulled it ceased to be evidence. By permitting it to be given weight the court reinstated it pro tanto. Heim v. United States, supra, 493. The conflict was not avoided by the court's charge. Giving to the withdrawn plea any weight is in principle quite as inconsistent with the prior order as it would be to hold the plea conclusive. Under the charge, if the plea was found not improperly obtained, the jury was required to give it weight unless petitioner was shown to be innocent. And, if admissible at all, such plea inevitably must be so considered. As a practical matter, it could not be received as evidence without putting petitioner in a dilemma utterly inconsistent with the determination of the court awarding him a trial. Its introduction may have turned the scale against him. 'The withdrawal of a plea of guilty is a poor privilege, if, notwithstanding its withdrawal, it may be used in evidence under the plea of not guilty.' White v. State, supra, 289. It is beside the \n\n[274 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n mark to say, as observed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that petitioner knew better than any one whether or not he was guilty and that under the evidence a plea of guilty was a reasonable thing. These suggestions might bear upon the weight of admissible evidence but they have no realtion to the admissibility of a withdrawn plea.\n Courts frequently permit pleas of guilty to be withdrawn and pleas of not guilty to be substituted. We have cited all the decisions, state and federal, which have come to our attention, that pass on the question here presented. The small number indicates that it this country it has not been customary to use withdrawn pleas as evidence of guilt. Counsel have cited no case, and we have found none, in which the question has been considered in English courts.\n We think the weight of reason is against the introduction in evidence of a plea of guilty withdrawn on order of court granting leave and permitting the substitution of a plea of not guilty.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLATZKO v. EQUITABLE TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK(1927)\nNo. 48\nArgued: October 19, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 254, 255]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles A. Brodek, of New York City, for Latzko.\n Mr. Godfrey Goldmark, of New York City (Messrs. George G. Ernst and Ralph F. Colin, both of New York City, of counsel), for Equitable Trust Co ., trustee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, here on petition and cross-petition for certiorari to review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, involves the same bankruptcy and questions similar to those considered in No. 34, Equitable Trust Co. of New York v. Rochling et al., \n275 \nU.S. 248\n, 48 S. Ct. 58, decided this day. Petitioners in No. 48, respondents in No. 49, later referred to as 'claimants,' are bankers of Budapest, who had a checking account with Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne, the bankrupts. On June 15, 1923, they procured a credit with the bankrupts through the deposit with the latter by the National City Bank of New York of its cashier's check, payable to the bankrupts' order, 'favor N. Latzko & A. Popper, Budapest.' On the same day, Goldman, Sachs \n\n[275 U.S. 254, 256]\n\u00a0\n & Co., bankers in New York, delivered to the bankrupts their check, drawn on the Bank of America in New York, and payable to the bankrupts, accompanied by a letter stating that the check was 'for account of Latzkopper, Budapest.' The bankrupts immediately credited both checks to the claimants, but they were not collected until after the bankruptcy petition had been filed on the following day. The proceeds of collection are traced into the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy and the present proceedings were brought for their reclamation in the district court for southern New York. The petition was dismissed. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the order of the District Court as to the National City Bank check and affirmed it as to that of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (In re Gubelman (C. C. A.) 10 F. (2d) 926), holding that the words in the former, 'favor N. Latzko and A. Popper, Budapest,' appearing on the face of the check, were restrictive and made the bankrupts agents for collection, but holding as to the latter that the words appearing in the letter accompanying the delivery of the check served only to indicate the account to be credited.\n Two circumstances are said by claimants to distinguish this case from No. 34, Equitable Trust Co. v. Rochling et al., \n275 \nU.S. 248\n, 48 S. Ct. 58, just decided. The first is the fact that the check involved in the claimants' petition was not a cashier's check, but the check of a bank drawn upon its own bank of deposit. The distinction seems to us to require no difference in result where, as here, the check was treated by the bankrupts as current funds and at once placed to the credit of the claimants. It is suggested also that although it was the practice of the bankrupts to credit checks to claimants as soon as deposited, it does not affirmatively appear that claimants asked or expected them to be credited in advance of collection or that the items were listed as immediately entitled to interest. But the \n\n[275 U.S. 254, 257]\n\u00a0\n mere absence of such proof cannot limit the effect of the dominant facts before us that the establishment of the credit was the objective of the claimants, and that that objective was attained when the credit was given. Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n271 \nU.S. 489\n, 46 S. Ct. 554. Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283\n, 25 S. Ct. 243. We cannot assume, in the absence of proof, that claimants, whose controlling purpose was to secure a credit with Knauth, Nachod & Kuhne, were unwilling to accept the credit, when given, because it anticipated the collection of the paper by 24 hours. There is then no basis for the distinctions attempted, and this case is controlled by our decision in No. 34. Considering the checks in the light most favorable to claimants, as though the language relied on appeared on the face of both checks, claimants are nevertheless only general creditors of the bankrupts and their petition was rightly denied by the district court. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAWRENCE v. ST. LOUIS-SAN FRANCISCO RY. CO.(1927)\nNo. 894\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 588, 589]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. B. Ames, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. C. B. Stuart, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal from a decree for an interlocutory injunction entered by the federal court for Northern Oklahoma. The plaintiff below was the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company; the defendants the Corporation Commission of that state, its Attorney General, and some citizens of Sapulpa. The bill was filed on Jan- \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 590]\n\u00a0\n uary 11, 1927. The case was heard on January 19, by three judges under section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended (Comp. St.  1243), and was decided on the same day. No opinion was delivered.\n The Act of February 5, 1917 (Compiled Oklahoma Laws 1921,  3482- 3485, 5548), prohibits a railroad from removing its 'shops or division points which have been located at any place in this state for a period of not less than five years without previously securing the permission of the Corporation Commission to make such removal.' Railroad shops and a division point of the St. Louis-San Francisco System, have been located in Sapulpa, Okl., since 1890. The railway indicated a purpose to remove these shops and the division point to Tulsa. On February 19, 1917, the Corporation Commission issued, upon complaint of citizens of Sapulpa and upon notice to and hearing of the railway, a temporary restraining order enjoining the removal. The railway acquiesced in this order, the commission retained jurisdiction of the cause, and neither party took any action therein for nearly 10 years. In December, 1926, while the restraining order issued in 1917 was in force, the railway, without leave of the commission, and without making any application in the cause, directed that the division point for passenger trains be changed in January, 1927, to Tulsa, and it indicated a purpose to remove its shops to West Tulsa. Thereupon the complaining citizens of Sapulpa filed in the cause a motion which, reciting these facts, prayed that the cause be set for hearing and that meanwhile the commission prohibit the railway from making any change. The commission set the hearing for January 17, 1927, and renewed the temporary restraining order.\n The railway brought this suit shortly before the day set for the hearing by the commission. The bill charges that the Oklahoma act violates the commerce clause, the \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 591]\n\u00a0\n due process clause, and the equal protection clause, and that, hence, the commission is without jurisdiction in the premises. The sole prayer is that the defendants be enjoined 'from compelling plaintiff to submit to the jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission in the several matters aforesaid'; that is, the proposed removal from Sapulpa. The decree is broader than the prayer. It enjoins the commission from hearing the cause pending before it, from taking any other action therein, from making or enforcing any order restraining the railway from removing its shops or division point from Sapulpa, and specifically from putting into effect a contemplated passenger train schedule on January 23, 1927; the schedule being intended to facilitate the change of the division point. It enjoins the other defendants from participation in any way in the proceedings before the commission.\n The decree disregards the requirement of section 19 of the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 738 (United States Code of Laws, Title 28,  383, p. 909; Comp. St.  1243c):\n'That every order of injunction ... shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of the same, shall be specific in terms. ...'\n\n It does not declare that the Oklahoma statute is unconstitutional, nor does it state any other reason why the action enjoined is a violation of plaintiff's rights. It does not recite, even in general terms, that there is danger of irreparable loss. It sets forth no fact from which such danger can be inferred. It recites merely that the case was submitted on affidavits and that:\n'The court, having considered said affidavits and having heard argument of counsel both for plaintiff and defendants, is of the opinion that the temporary injunction prayed for by plaintiff herein should be in all things granted.'\n\n Although proper practice demands that the provision thus prescribed by Congress be scrupulously observed, disregard of the statutory requirement concerning the \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 592]\n\u00a0\n form of the order did not render the interlocutory decree void. Druggan v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 36, 40\n, 46 S. Ct. 14. It must, however, be reversed, because the verified bill and the affidavits fail to supply that evidence of danger of irreparable injury to plaintiff which is essential to justify issuance of a temporary injunction. Indeed, it appears affirmatively from the allegations of the bill and the facts testified to in the affidavits that irreparable injury would not have resulted from the failure to issue a restraining order before serving notice on the defendants, that the interlocutory injunction should have been denied, except possibly as to the adoption of the new passenger train schedule on January 23, 1927, and that otherwise action by the court should have awaited the final hearing.\n The only relief prayed for in the bill is that the defendants be enjoined 'from compelling plaintiff to submit to the jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission in the several matters aforesaid.' There is no prayer for general relief. No right or interest of the railway would have been prejudiced by participating in the hearing before the commission and awaiting the result thereof. The railway would not thereby have waived its right to contest in the federal court the validity of the Oklahoma law. Nor would delay in making application to the federal court have subjected it to penalties under the Oklahoma law. The earliest date on which the railway is definitely shown to have proposed to take any action falling within the prohibition of the commission's order was January 23, 1927, when the railway proposed to put into effect the new schedule involving change of the division point for passenger trains from Sapulpa to Tulsa. The hearing before the commission had been set for January 17, 1927. It was clearly possible, and was perhaps probable, that the commission would, after hearing argument on that day, have modified its order, so as to permit the passenger schedule to go into effect. For \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 593]\n\u00a0\n the matter of serious concern to Sapulpa was the threatened removal of the shops and the freight terminals; not the proposed new schedule for passenger trains. Moreover, if the commission had refused to permit the passenger schedule to go into effect, the railway would still have had ample opportunity before January 23 to secure from the federal court relief in that respect.\n The broader permission to remove both the shops and the division point might also have been granted by the commission, if it had been permitted to proceed with the hearing set for January 17. The railway asserts that the removal would result in an improved service and in economy in operation. If this appeared to be true, it was the duty of the commission, under the Oklahoma law, to authorize the removal, unless thereby the health of the employees of the railway or of their families was imperiled. It is not to be assumed that the railway proposed to remove the shops to an unhealthy location. And it may not be assumed that the commission would have disregarded its duty. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Michigan Railroad Commission, \n231 U.S. 457\n, 464-466, 34 S. Ct. 152; Western & Atlantic R. R. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n267 \nU.S. 493, 496\n, 45 S. Ct. 409.\n The facts alleged in the bill and testified to in the affidavits, show also otherwise that there was not danger of irreparable loss to plaintiff within established rules of equity practice. The railway had for ten years acquiesced in the commission's order prohibiting removal. There had not been, so far as appears, even a suggestion to the commission that the act under which the order issued was invalid, or that the order was otherwise objectionable to the railway. The advisability of the removal of the shops was a matter as to which the railway officials had differed in judgment. The vice president in charge of operation testified: 'We should have changed many years ago.' The president assured a committee representing Sapulpa in December, 1925, that the city \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 594]\n\u00a0\n was 'the logical place for the terminal now located there, ... that his company was considering the enlargement of the terminals, ... and that there was not reason for any anxiety on the part of the citizens of Sapulpa as to the removal of the terminals.' In December, 1296, apparently, the railway's officials concluded that, in view of the changed traffic and operating conditions, the time had come when the removal of the shops and division point from Sapulpa to Tulsa should be undertaken, and that, with a relatively small capital outlay at Tulsa, the removal would result, not only in improved service, but also in an important saving in operating expenses. But there was no emergency requiring the issue of an interlocutory injunction. To the railway the matter was not one of vital concern. For it, time was not of the essence. The effect of the commission's restraining order was merely to keep things in statu quo until the final hearing in the federal court. The interlocutory decree set the railway free to remove the shops before the case could be heard on final hearing. By ending the status quo which had existed for 10 years, it exposed the city and its citizens to danger of irreparable loss. The change subjected Sapulpa to grave and immediate peril. Removal of the shops, which had been located in Sapulpa for a generation, would probably affect property values seriously, and might bring disaster in its train. It might ruin businesses. It might result in unemployment. It might compel many of Sapulpa's citizens to seek homes elsewhere. On application for an interlocutory injunction such considerations are of weight.\n We have no occasion to determine whether the Oklahoma act is obnoxious to the federal Constitution. But, as bearing upon the propriety of issuing the temporary injunction, the fact is important that the controversy concerns the respective powers of the nation and of the states over railroads engaged in interstate commerce. \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 595]\n\u00a0\n Such railroads are subject to regulation by both the state and the United States. The delimitation of the respective powers of the two governments requires often nice adjustments. The federal power is paramount. But public interest demands that, whenever possible, conflict between the two authorities and irritation be avoided. To this end it is important that the federal power be not exerted unnecessarily, hastily, or harshly. It is important, also, that the demands of comity and courtesy, as well as of the law, be deferred to. It was said in Western & Atlantic R. R. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n267 \nU.S. 493, 496\n, 45 S. Ct. 409, that a law of a state may be valid which prohibits an important change in local transportation conditions without application to the state commission, although the ultimate authority to determine whether the change could or should be made may rest with the federal commission. And it was there said that the 'action of the company in discontinuing the service without a petition' to the state body was 'arbitrary and defiant.' Compare Henderson Water Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 278\n, 46 S. Ct. 112. To require that the regulating body of the state be advised of a proposed change seriously affecting transportation conditions is not such an obvious interference with interstate commerce that, on application for a preliminary injunction, the act should lightly be assumed to be beyond the power of the state.\n The decree recites that a restraining order was issued on the filing of the bill. So far as appears, the court also disregarded in issuing it the requirement of section 17 of the Act of October 15, 1914 (Code, tit. 28,  381, p. 909; Comp. St.  1234a). We think that section 17 applies to suits brought under  266 of the Judicial Code. \n1\n Section 17 provides:\n'Every such \n\n[274 U.S. 588, 596]\n\u00a0\n temporary restraining order ... shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice . ...'\n\n It provides also:\n'No temporary restraining order shall be granted without notice to the opposite party unless it shall clearly appear from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified bill that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before notice can be served and a hearing had thereon.'\n\n Such facts do not appear to have been shown. They are not alleged in the verified bill; and the affidavits in support were not filed until the hearing on the interlocutory injunction.\n The purpose of Congress in requiring that 'every order for an injunction shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of the same,' was in part to insure deliberation, and thus minimize the chances of error. It was in part to prevent or allay the irritation naturally incident to interference by injunction with the action of the state government. Congress did not require the court to supplement the recitals in the decree by a fuller statement in an opinion. The importance of an opinion to litigants and to this court in cases of this character was pointed out in Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 222. The importance is even greater where the decree enjoins the enforcement of a state law or the action of state officials thereunder. For then the respect due to the state demands that the need for nullifying the action of its Legislature or of its executive officials be persuasively shown.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 17 took the place of section 263 of the Judicial Code, which was of general application. The last sentence of section 17 (omitted from section 381 of title 28 of the Code) reads: 'Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to alter, repeal or amend section two hundred and sixty-six' of the Judicial Code. In requiring specific findings of irreparable damage in the issuance of restraining orders, no alteration, repeal, or amendment of section 266 was made. \n\n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEWELLYN v. ELECTRIC REDUCTION CO(1927)\nNo. 71\nArgued: October 26, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. S. Leo Ruslander, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the third circuit, to review its judgment (Electric Reduction Co. v. Lewellyn, 11 F.(2d) 493) reversing the judgment of the District Court for Western Pennsylvania (8 F.(2d) 91), and awarding a new trial. The action was brought by respondent to recover income taxes paid by it for the year 1918. By written stipulation a jury was waived and the case was tried to the court, which made special findings and on them gave judgment for defendant. The principal question to be determined is the right of the respondent, upheld below, to deduct an admitted business loss from its gross income for 1918 in determining its tax for that year, rather than from gross income for a later year.\n In July, 1918, respondent contracted with one Jouravleff for the sale and delivery to it in monthly installments of a quantity of tungsten ore. The contract required the buyer immediately to accept a bill of exchange drawn on \n\n[275 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n it by the seller in the sum of $30,000, which was to be applied against the purchase price of the first carload of ore shipped. Respondent accepted the draft and the seller negotiated it through bankers associated with him in the transaction. Respondent paid it at maturity, in advance of any actual shipment of ore, having received from the broker who had negotiated the sale, a telegram saying: 'Shipment one car will be made to- day.' Only a small quantity of ore was ever shipped. This was received in the following December and after being credited upon the amount of the draft left a balance of more than $27,000. In March of the following year respondent began three separate suits to recover the $27,000-one against the seller, the second against the broker as an alleged surety or guarantor of the seller, and the third against the bankers. Judgment secured against the seller in 1919 remains unsatisfied. The suit against the broker resulted in a judgment for the defendant in November, 1922. The suit against the bankers was discontinued in 1921 as useless after they had been adjudged bankrupt. Respondent did not charge off the $27,000 on its books in 1918, but continued to carry it as an item it its 'bills receivable' account. It claimed no loss on account of the payment in its tax return for that year. Upon the termination of the litigation in 1922 it filed an amended tax return for 1918, deducting the uncollected balance as a loss, and brought the present suit to recover the alleged overpayment of tax.\n Section 234 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1078 ( Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 pp), provides that in arriving at taxable income there may be deducted:\n'(4) Losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise; ...\n\n'(5) Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year.' \n\n[275 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n The district court held that the Ioss was upon a worthless debt deductible under subdivision (5) and not deductible for 1918 because not charged off in that year.\n\n The respondent contends and the court below held that the loss was not one upon a worthless debt, deductible under subsection (5), but was deductible when 'sustained' under subsection (4), and concludes that the loss was rightly deducted as of 1918 since the loss was sustained when respondent paid out the money for which it received no return.\n We assume without deciding, as was assumed by both courts below, that subsection (4) and subsection (5) are mutually exclusive so that a loss deductible under one may not be deducted under the other. We may assume also that upon the abandonment of the contract by the seller the buyer might have maintained an action to recover the balance of the money which he had paid. But so far as appears from the record there had been no abandonment by the seller in 1918. Throughout that period the buyer was calling for deliveries and some were made as late as in December. The buyer's rights were upon a contract for the delivery of merchandise and were not a 'debt' in either a technical or a colloquial sense. We conclude that if respondent's contract rights became worthless in 1918 he was not required to deduct his loss as a worthless debt under subsection (5), but was entitled to deduct it under subsection (4) as a loss sustained in that year.\n But we do not think that a loss resulting from a buyer's prepayment to a seller who proves to be irresponsible in necessarily sustained, in the statutory meaning, as soon as the money is paid. The statute was intended to apply not only to losses resulting from the physical destruction of articles of value but to those occurring in the operations of trade and business, where the business man has ven- \n\n[275 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n tured on a course of action in the reasonable expectation that the promised conduct of another will come to pass. Not only the future success of the business but its present solvency depends on the probable accuracy of his prophecy. Only when events prove the prophecy to have been false can it be said that he has suffered. His case is not like that of a man who fails to learn of the theft of his bonds or the burning of his house until a year after the occurrence, but rather resembles the position of a merchant who buys in one year, for sale in the next, merchandise which shifting fashion renders unsaleable in the latter. It may well be that he whose house has been burned has sustained a loss whether he knows it or not and may recover a tax paid in ignorance of that material fact. But we cannot say that the merchant whose action has been based not merely on ignorance of a fact but on faith in a prophecy-even though the prophecy is made without full knowledge of the facts-can claim to have sustained a loss before the future fails to justify his hopes.\n Here the only fact relied upon to show a loss is the outcome of the litigations two years after respondent's payment to Jouravleff. There is nothing in the findings from which we could conclude that the respondent in 1918 had ceased to regard his rights under the contract as having value or that there was then reasonable ground to suppose that efforts to enforce them would be fruitless. On the findings respondent is not entitled to recover.\n At the trial respondent offered evidence that it had conducted, in 1918, an investigation which tended to show the irresponsibility of Jouravleff. Inquires, variously phrased, to elicit this fact were excluded by the trial judge both because they were irrelevant and because the evidence offered was inadmissible as hearsay. An examination of the bill of exceptions discloses that the proffered testimony was rightly excluded on this latter ground. \n\n[275 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n Hence no error was committed by the trial court in its rulings. A trial by jury having been waived in writing, our review in this case is limited to the sufficiency of the facts specially found to support the judgment, and to the rulings excepted to and presented by the bill of exceptions (Rev. Stat.  649, 700 (28 USCA  773, 875 (Comp. St.  1587, 1668)); Fleischmann Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349\n, 46 S.

Aaron Sapiro and Robert S. Marx, both of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This proceeding was commenced by a petition filed by the plaintiffs in error on the law side of the Federal District Court for Eastern Kentucky, seeking to obtain a judgment declaring their rights under an Act of the Kentucky Legislature.\n The Declaratory Judgment Law of Kentucky, Acts of 1922, ch. 83, provides that in any action in a court of record of that Commonwealth having general jurisdiction wherein it is made to appear that an actual controversy sexists, the plaintiff may, by means of a petition on the law or equity side of the court, as the nature of the case may require, ask for and obtain 'a declaration of rights, either alone or with other relief; and the court may make a binding declaration of rights, whether or not consequential relief is or could be asked' (section 1); and that further relief, based on such declaratory judgment, may be granted by the court whenever necessary or proper, either in the same proceeding or in an independent action, upon notice to any adverse party whose rights have been adjudicated by the declaratory judgment. \n\n[273 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n The petition alleged that the plaintiffs, a Kentucky corporation and a citizen of North Carolina, were engaged in operating a looseleaf tobacco warehouse in Kentucky, in which they sold leaf tobacco at public auction for their customers and patrons; that their rights were materially and seriously affected by chapter 10 of the Kentucky Acts of 1924, regulating the sales of leaf tobacco at public auction; that this Act was invalid and repugnant to the Bill of Rights and Constitution of Kentucky, the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States (art. 1,  8, cl. 3), the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment ( section 1), and the Sherman Anti-Trust Law (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827- 8830); that an actual controversy existed with respect thereto, in that the plaintiffs had been threatened with various civil and criminal punishments and penalties for the violation of the Act, which were about to be enforced thereunder; that in conducting their business, it was necessary for them to know whether the Act was valid or invalid, and whether they were liable for the crimes therein denounced, and subject to the fines and penalties it prescribed, and they could not continue their business without a financial loss, amounting to confiscation of their rights, business and property, unless the court made a declaration of their rights and duties under the Act; that they made this application to the court in accordance with the Federal Conformity Statute and the Declaratory Judgment Law of Kentucky 'for the purpose of securing a declaration of their rights and duties' under the Act of 1924, and having the 'court determine whether in the conduct of their business it will be necessary for them to comply' with the provisions of the Act, or whether it is 'invalid in whole or in part, and if so, in what part'; and that the Commonwealth Attorney was made a party defendant as the representative of the Commonwealth charged with the duty of enforcing the Act, and who, as such, 'prepared the indictments referred to herein.' No \n\n[273 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n other reference, however, was made to any such indictments in the petition.\n The plaintiffs prayed the court 'by its judgment to declare what their rights and duties under said Act of 1924 are, and that a judgment be rendered declaring said Act of 1924 invalid, and for all proper relief.'\n The defendant demurred to the petition, on the ground, among others, that the court had no jurisdiction of the cause of action set forth, having no power or authority as a Federal Court to entertain a proceeding for a declaration of the rights of parties or to act under the provisions of the Declaratory Judgment Law of Kentucky. This demurrer was sustained. Twelve days later a final judgment was ntered, reciting that the plaintiffs having failed to amend their petition, and the court being of opinion that it had no jurisdiction of the action, the same was dismissed. This direct writ of error was allowed upon the question of jurisdiction, under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) before the amendment made by the Jurisdictional Act of 1925 became effective.\n The sole purpose of the petition, as shown by its express allegations, is to obtain a declaration from the District Court of the rights and duties of the plaintiffs under the Act of 1924, and a determination of the extent to which they must comply with its provisions in the conduct of their business. This is its entire scope. While the Commonwealth Attorney is made a defendant as a representative of the Commonwealth, there is no semblance of any adverse litigation with him individually; there being neither any allegation that the plaintiffs have done or contemplate doing any of the things forbidden by the Act before being advised by the court as to their rights nor any allegation that the Commonwealth Attorney has threatened to take or contemplates taking any action against them for any violation of the Act, either past or prospective. And no relief of any kind is prayed against him, by restraining action on his part or otherwise. \n\n[273 U.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n The question whether the District Court has jurisdiction to entertain such a petition for a declaration of rights admits of but one answer under the prior decisions of this Court.\n We need not review these at length. It sufficies to say that in the light of the decisions in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 357\n, 31 S. Ct. 250; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126, 129\n, 42 S. Ct. 274; Texas v.

Ct. 597; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 330\n, 46 S. Ct. 122, and Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S. Ct. 284, this day decided-in which the principles stated in earlier cases are considered and applied-it is not open to question that the judicial power vested by Article 3 of the Constitution in this Court and the inferior courts of the United States established by Congress thereunder, extends only to 'cases' and 'controversies' in which the claims of litigants are brought before them for determination by such regular proceedings as are established for the protection and enforcement of rights, or the prevention, redress, or punishment of wrongs; and that their jurisdiction is limited to cases and controversies presented in such form, with adverse litigants, that the judicial power is capable of acting upon them, and pronouncing and carrying into effect a judgment between the parties, and does not extend to the determination of abstract questions or issues framed for the purpose of invoking the advice of the court without real parties or a real case.\n In the Muskrat Case, supra, in which it was held that it was not within the constitutional authority of this Court to entertain an appeal from the Court of Claims in a suit brought, under a permissive act of Congress, by members of the Cherokee Tribe of Indians to determine the constitutional validity of certain congressional enactments, the Court, in an extended opinion reviewing the earlier \n\n[273 U.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n cases, said:\n'As we have already seen by the express terms of the Constitution, the exercise of the judicial power is limited to 'cases' and 'controversies.' Beyond this it does not extend, and unless it is asserted in a case or controversy within the meaning of the Constitution, the power to exercise it is nowhere conferred. ... It is ... evident that there is neither more nor less in this procedure than an attempt to provide for a judicial determination ... of the constitutional validity of an act of Congress. Is such a determination within the judicial power conferred by the Constitution, as the same has been interpreted and defined in the authoritative decisions to which we have referred? We think it is not. That judicial power, as we have seen, is the right to determine actual controversies arising between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper jurisdiction. ... This attempt to obtain a judicial declaration of the validity of the act of Congress is not presented in a 'case' or 'controversy,' to which under the Constitution of the United States, the judicial power alone extends . ... The whole purpose of the law is to determine the constitutional validity of this class of legislation, in a suit not arising between parties concerning a property right necessarily involved in the decision in question, but in a proceeding against the Government in its sovereign capacity, and concerning which the only judgment required is to settle the doubtful character of the legislation in question. Such judgment will not conclude private parties, when actual litigation brings to the court the question of the constitutionality of such legislation. In a legal sense the judgment could not be executed, and amounts in fact to no more than an expression of opinion upon the validity of the acts in question.'\n\n And in New Jersey v. Sargent, supra, it was held that this Court could not entertain a bill for an injunction against Federal officers charged with the administration \n\n[273 U.S. 70, 76]\n\u00a0\n of a Federal statute, which did not show that any justiciable right of the State was being, or about to be, affected prejudicially by the application of the statute, but, in effect, sought merely to obtain an abstract judicial declaration that, in certain features, the statute exceeded the authority of Congress and encroached upon that of the State.\n It follows necessarily from these decisions that the District Court, as a court of the United States established under Article 3 of the Constitution, had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for the declaratory judgment.\n Manifestly the Federal Conformity Statute, Rev. St.  914 (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  724; Comp. St.  1537) conferred upon the court no jurisdiction to proceed in accordance with the Declaratory Judgment Law of Kentucky. This statute relates only to 'practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding'; and neither purports to nor can extend the jurisdiction of the district courts beyond the constitutional limitations. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 209\n, 13 S. Ct. 44; Mexican Central Ry. v. Pinkney, \n149 \nU.S. 194, 206\n, 13 S. Ct. 859.\n The plaintiffs in error also rely in argument here upon  274a of the Judicial Code (U. S. C.ode, tit. 28,  397; Comp. St.  1251a), which provides that on finding that a suit at law should have been brought in equity, or vice versa, the court shall order any amendments to the pleadings which may be necessary to conform to the proper practice, and that any party may amend his pleadings so as to obviate the objection that his suit was not brought on the right side of the court. This statute relates merely to a case in which the objection is to the side of the court on which the suit is brought, and not to the entire lack of jurisdiction in the court. It is plain that it has no application here, where the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the petition for a declaratory judgment either upon the equity or the law side. \n\n[273 U.S. 70, 77]\n\u00a0\n The judgment dismissing the petition for want of jurisdiction is accordingly affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIGGETT & MYERS TOBACCO CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 362\nArgued: March 3, 1927Decided: May 2, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 215, 216]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Chester A. Gwinn, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff brought this action to recover a balance claimed for tobacco products obtained from it for the Navy and Marine Corps between September 8 and November 23, 1918. The Court of Claims found the value to be $483,504.30, and that in the same period the United States paid on account $423,893.96, and gave judgment for the difference, $59,610.34, without more. The plaintiff contends that the products were taken under the power of eminent domain, and that it is entitled to such additional sum as will produce the equivalent of their value paid at the time of the taking, and that interest at a reasonable rate is the measure of the amount required to be added in order to make just compensation.\n The sole question is whether the facts found constitute a taking by eminent domain. Plaintiff was engaged in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. August 26, 1918, the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts of the Navy issued and delivered to it Navy order N-4128, stating that pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1917 (39 Stat. 1168, 1193), and the Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 182), and under the direction of the President an order thereby was placed to furnish specified tobacco products for which provisional prices were named; that compliance was obligatory; that no commercial orders should be allowed to interfere with the delivery called for; that, as it was impracticable then to 'determine a reasonable and just compensation for the material to be delivered, the fixing of the price will be sub- \n\n[274 U.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n ject to later determination. You are assured of a reasonable profit under this order; and as an advance payment you will be paid the unit prices stated hereon, with the understanding that such advance payment will not be considered as having any bearing upon the price to be subsequently fixed. Any difference between the amount of such advance payment and the amount finally determined upon as being just and reasonable will be paid to you or refunded by you, as the case may be.' The document stated that the order must be accepted and filled in any event; that it was to be signed and returned by plaintiff; that deliveries were to be made as directed by a designated officer and bills sent to him bearing a certificate that the prices were those stated in the order; and that the conditions appearing on the reverse side of the order were made a part of it. These included printed portions of the above-mentioned Acts of Congress empowering the President in time of war to place an order with any person for war material, of a kind and quantity being produced by him, as the necessities of the government might require; declaring that 'compliance with all such orders shall be obligatory,' and that, whenever the United States shall requisition any war material 'it shall make just compensation therefor'; and authorizing the President to exercise this power through agencies to be determined by him. September 9, 1918, the Paymaster General of the Navy directed that any orders issued by the Quartermaster General of the Marine Corps should be executed and billed at the prices specified in order N-4128. And, October 14 and November 22 following, the order was further modified, so as to call for additional tobacco products. Upon receipt of the order and each of the modifications plaintiff signed a statement thereon that it was 'accepted subject to the conditions' specified. The President had authorized the Secretary of the Navy, either directly or through any officer who acting under the Secretary had \n\n[274 U.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n authority to make contracts on behalf of the government, to exercise all the power and authority vested in the President applicable to the production, purchase and requisitioning of war material.\n Navy order N-4128 did not purport to be an offer to purchase; it commanded delivery of specified merchandise. Plaintiff's consent was not sought; it was not consulted as to quantity, price, time or place of delivery. The Navy relied upon the compulsory provisions of the acts of Congress and commanded compliance with the order. These acts authorized the requisition of plaintiff's property for public use. The President was empowered to take immediate possession of its plant to manufacture the tobacco products called for. Act of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166, 213. And it is to be presumed that the plant would have been taken if plaintiff had refused compliance. The acceptance was not the closing of a contract; it was the expression of purpose to obey. And the order was a continuing one and operated to require delivery of the specified articles whether then on hand or thereafter to be produced.\n The findings show that plaintiff's property was taken by eminent domain; and its just compensation includes the additional amount claimed.

Ledbetter, of Ardmore, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. S. R. Bowen, of Washington, D. C., and W. F. Semple, of Durant, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We here are asked to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma rendered after the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, amending the Judicial Code, became effective. An allotment made in the name and right of a deceased Choctaw Indian woman under section 22 of the Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641, is involved. The only federal question in the case is whether \n\n[274 U.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n Congress intended by that section and other related congressional enactments that the surviving husband of the deceased should take an estate by the curtesy in the land. This question was resolved by the Supreme Court of the state in favor of the husband; and at the instance of the opposing party the chief justice of that court allowed a writ of error bringing the judgment here for review. The writ obviously was improvidently allowed. Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214) restricts the cases in which we may review a judgment or decree of a state court on writ of error to those 'where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, and the decision is against its validity; or where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treates, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.' This case does not involve any such constitutional question, but only a question of the construction and application of congressional enactments concededly valid. It therefore falls within the class where a review in this court may be had only on petition for certiorari under section 237(b) of the Judicial Code. The distinction is important, has a real purpose and should be given effect by all who are invested with authority to allow writs of error running from this court to a state court. A failure to observe it may subject the party suing out the writ to damages and double costs (Rev. Stat.  1010 (Comp. St.  1671); Judicial Code,  237(c)) and result in harmful embarrassment to the other party. Of course where the writ is improvidently allowed the other party may move in this court to dismiss it. But in actual practice this does not operate as an adequate corrective; for the action of the judge in allowing the writ usually is assumed to be advisedly taken. In the present case the fact that the allowance was improvident escaped the notice of the parties for a full year.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n While we cannot take jurisidction on the writ of error so improvidently allowed, we can, under section 237(c) of the Judicial Code, treat the papers whereon the writ was allowed as a petition for certiorari and as if presented to this court at the time they were presented to the judge who allowed the writ. The papers have been examined under that section; and we are of opinion that, treating them as a petition for certiorari, they disclose a case and situation in which the petition should be granted.\n Writ of error as such dismissed, but as petition for certiorari granted. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUIS PIZITZ DRY GOODS CO. v. YELDELL(1927)\nNo. 171\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph P. Mudd, of Birmingham, Ala., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Benjamin F. Ray, of Birmingham, Ala., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error, an administrator, brought suit in the circuit court of Jefferson County, Alabama, to recover for the wrongful death of his intestate, caused by the negligent operation of an elevator by an employee of plaintiff in error in its department store. The action was founded upon the so-called Homicide Act of Alabama (section 5696, Code of 1923) printed in the margin. 1 This statute authorizes the recovery of damages from either a principal or an agent, in such amount as the jury may assess, for wrongful act or negligence causing death. The jury returned a verdict of $9,500 and judgment for that amount was affirmed on \n\n[274 U.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n appeal. 213 Ala. 222, 104 So. 526. The case comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237, as amended (Comp. St.  1214).\n Plaintiff in error does not deny its liability for the negligent act of its employee. But it calls attention to the fact that the Homicide Act imposing liability upon the employer for death resulting from the wrongful acts, omissions or negligence of its employees, as interpreted by the state courts, permits the jury, as in this case, to assess punitive damages against the employer for the mere negligence of its employee. Richmond & Danville R. R. v. Freeman, 97 Ala. 289, 11 So. 800. A statute which so authorizes the mulcting of the employer, it is argued, is 'unreasonably oppressive, arbitrary, unjust, violative of the fundamental conceptions of fair play, and, therefore, repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.'\n The legislation now challenged has been on the statute books of Alabama in essentially its present form since 1872. The liability imposed is for tortious acts resulting in death, but the damages, which may be punitive even though the act complained of involved no element of recklessness, malice, or willfulness, may be assessed against the employer who, as here, is personally without fault. The Supreme Court of Alabama has repeatedly ruled that the statute is aimed at the prevention of death by wrongful act or omission. Savannah & Memphis R. R. v. Shearer, 58 Ala. 672, 680; South and North Alabama R. R. v. Sullivan, 59 Ala. 272, 279. 'The statute is remedial, and not penal, and was designed as well to give a right of action where none existed before, as to 'prevent homicides,' and the action given is purely civil in its nature for the redress of private, and not public wrongs.' Southern Ry. v. Bush, 122 Ala. 470, 489, 26 So. 168, 174. In defining the scope of the act, the state court has pointed out that the extent of the culpability and the amount of the verdict are for the jury and that its finding is not to be disturbed unless the verdict \n\n[274 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n is 'induced or reached on account of prejudice, passion, or other improper motive or cause.' Mobile Electric Co. v. Fritz, 200 Ala. 692, 693, 77 So. 235, 236. The case was argued here on the assumption that its scope was thus limited and we so interpret the statute. Its constitutionality has been upheld by both state and federal courts. Richmond & Danville R. R. v. Freeman, supra; U. S. Cast Iron Pipe & Foundry Co. v. Sullivan (C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 794.\n The objections now urged to a new form of vicarious liability were considered and rejected in the Workmen's Compensation cases (New York Central R. R. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642), as they must be rejected here. The extension of the doctrine of liability without fault to new situations to attain a permissible legislative object is not so novel in the law or so shocking 'to reason or to conscience' as to afford in itself any ground for the contention that it denies due process of law. The principle of respondeat superior itself and the rule of liability of corporations for the willful torts of their employees extended in some jurisdictions, without legislative sanction, to liability for punitive damages (Boyer & Co. v. Coxen, 92 Md. 366, 48 A. 161; Hanson v. E. & N. A. R. R., 62 Me. 84, 16 Am. Rep. 404; Jeffersonville R. R. v. Rogers, 38 Ind. 116, 10 Am. Rep. 103; Atlantic & Great West. Ry. v. Dunn, 19 Ohio St. 162, 2 Am. Rep. 382. See Jefferson County Savings Bank v. Eborn, 84 Ala. 529, 534, 4 So. 386. Contra, Lake Shore Ry. v. Prentice, \n147 \nU.S. 101\n, 13 S. Ct. 261), are recognitions by the common law that the imposition of liability without personal fault, having its foundation in a recognized public policy, is not repugnant to accepted notions of due process of law. No constitutional question was presented in Lake Shore Ry. v. Prentice, supra, and this court thus was free to choose as between these conflicting common law rules the one which it thought most appropriate.\n Lord Campbell's Act and its successors, establishing liability for wrongful death where none existed before, \n\n[274 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n the various Workmen's Compensation Acts imposing new types of liability, are familiar examples of the legislative creation of new rights and duties for the prevention of wrong or for satisfying social and economic needs. Their constitutionality may not be successfully challenged merely because a change in the common law is effected. As interpreted by the state court, the aim of the present statute is to strike at the evil of the negligent destruction of human life by imposing liability, regardless of fault, upon those who are in some substantial measure in a position to prevent it. We cannot say that it is beyond the power of a Legislature, in effecting such a change in common law rules, to attempt to preserve human life by making homicide expensive. It may impose an extraordinary liability such as the present, not only upon those at fault but upon those who, although not directly culpable, are able nevertheless, in the management of their affairs, to guard substantially against the evil to be prevented. See St. Louis Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 381\n, 28 S. Ct. 616; Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 36 S. Ct. 482; Wilmington Mining Co. v. Fulton, \n205 \nU.S. 60\n, 27 S. Ct. 412; cf. Van Oster v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 465\n, 47 S. Ct. 133, 47 A. L. R. 1044. Or it may impose on the business or enterprise in which such loss of life occurs the economic burden of the protective measure adopted (New York Central R. R. v. White, supra; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44), or return to and substitute the common-law method of permitting the jury to fix the amount of recovery, at least to the extent of an exercise of its reasonable judgment, for the present-day method of weighing and measuring the value of human life.\n The distinction between punitive and compensatory damages is a modern refinement. The first use of the term 'exemplary damages' is ascribed to Lord Camden in Huckle v. Money, 2 Wils. 205. See Sedgwick, Damages,  348. Although sporadic instances of new trials being \n\n[274 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n ordered because the verdict was excessive may be found in the early common law (see Wood v. Gunston, Style, 466; Chambers v. Robinson, 2 Stra. 691), it was not until much later that the formal practice developed (Duberley v. Gunning, 4 T. R. 654; Wilford v. Berkeley, 1 Burr, 610; Mayne, Damages, 691), and the fixed rules of damages evolved.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'A personal representative may maintain an action, and recover such damages as the jury may assess in a court of competent jurisdiction within the state of Alabama, and not elsewhere, for the wrongful act, omission, or negligence of any person or persons, or corporation, his or their servants or agents, whereby the death of his testator or intestate was caused, if the testator or intestate could have maintained an action for such wrongful act, omission, or negligence, if it had not caused death.

The cause is reviewable by certiorari, and the application therefor is granted. The writ of error will be dismissed.\n April 3, 1920, the petitioner received from respondent Gardiner at Crowley, La., various articles consigned to himself at Murray, Ky., and issued to him two bills of lading which contained this clause:\n'Suits for loss, damage or delay shall be instituted only within two years and one day after delivery of the property.'\n\n The goods were delivered at Murray in bad condition April 15, 1920. He sued to recover for the damage in a Louisiana state court, April 12, 1922. The company success- \n\n[273 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n fully relied upon the local statute of limitation:\n'All actions for loss of or damage to shipments of freight shall be prescribed by two years, said prescription to run from the date of shipment.' Act No. 223 of 1914\n\n\n\n The Court of Appeal declared:\n'The liability sought to be enforced is the 'liability' of an interstate carrier for loss or damages under an interstate contract of shipment. ... The validity of any stipulation in such a contract which involves the construction of the statute and the validity of the limitation thereby imposed, is a federal question, to be determined under the general law, and as such is withdrawn from the field of state law or legislation. ... State laws limiting time for bringing suit on interstate shipments are superseded by Carmark Amendment.'\n\n And it accordingly held the plea of prescription insufficient, reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.\n On the second trial judgment went for respondent for the full amount claimed. The Court of Appeal reduced this by the amount of the company's claim for an undercharge and the war tax. The Supreme Court refused a writ of certiorari.\n Petitioner maintains that the federal statutes prescribe no limitation and that the state law controls. We think this is the correct view. The court below wrongly construed the federal statutes.\n The Carmack Amendment to the Hepburn Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  7, 34 Stat. 584, 595, added the following provision to section 20, Act to Regulate Commerce Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 386:\n'That any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, \n\n[273 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed: Provided, that nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under existing law.'

St.  8604a.\n\n This court held that bills of lading for interstates shipments issued after the Carmack Amendment must be construed according to rules approved by the federal courts and upheld provisions therein which required claims to be filed within any specified time if reasonable.

Comp. St.  8604a.\n\n The bills of lading issued by petitioner undertook to restrict the institution of suits for loss to two years and one day after delivery of the property. This restriction does not accord with the Transportation Act which declared unlawful any limitation shorter than two years from the time notice is given of the disallowance of the claim, and is therefore ineffective. See Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Bewsher (C. C. A.) 6 F.(2d) 947. But neither the above-quoted provision from the Cummins Amendment nor the one from the Transportation Act was intended to operate as a statute of limitation. They restricted the freedom of carriers to fix the period within which suit could be brought-prohibited contracts for any shorter period than the one specified.\n Here, although the rights of the parties depended upon instruments the meaning and effect of which must be determined according to rules approved by the federal courts, there was no federal statute of limitations and the local one applied.

R. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 61\nArgued: January 6, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant owns and operates a system of railroads among which are two land grant aided lines. During the period from 1911 to 1917 there were transported for the government over these lines upon transportation requests large numbers of officers and enlisted men of the United States army and navy. Individual passenger rates to the public during that time were in force, and in addition certain party rates open to the public, by which 10 or more passengers were entitled to reduced rates. Some of the rate tariffs provided for cash payments when tickets were issued, and that there should be no land grant deductions made from such party rates. In other tariffs no such provisions were made. As initial carrier, appellant presented its bills on proper forms to the disbursing officers of the government. In some of the bills individual rates with land grant deductions were charged, where 10 or more persons had been transported in troop movement; and in others party rates without land grant deductions were charged, depending upon which was the lower rate. The accounting officers of the government in all these cases applied party rates with land grant deductions. To these rulings appellant filed protests, and this suit to recover the amounts involved followed. \n\n[273 U.S. 321, 323]\n\u00a0\n The court below denied appellant's right of recovery. 59 Ct. Cl. 886.\n Appellant's contentions are (1) that the government, in transporting troops, has no right to avail itself of party rates, but that these are restricted to passengers traveling on private account; and (2) that, if the government avail itself of the party rates, it must pay cash in advance in accordance with the tariff provisions.\n It is not disputed that in virtue of valid acts of Congress (for example, 36 Stat. 243, 256, c. 115) appellant's land grant aided lines were bound to carry officers and men of the army and navy at a rate, in the words of the law, 'not to exceed fifty per centum of the compensation for such government transportation as shall at that time be charged to and paid by private parties to any such company for like and similar transportation.' and that such amounts must 'be accepted as in full for all demands for such service.' That the party rates, being open to private parties, were open to the government, with a deduction of 50 per cent., under this express provision of the statute, does not admit of doubt.\n Nor is there any merit in the contention that the government may avail itself of the rate only by paying cash in advance. Appellant issued the tickets and sent in its bills therefor, without asking for cash payments. It thereby waived the requirement, if any existed, for payment in cash. Moreover, as the court below pointed out, the government from the very nature of things cannot be required to deal for transportation on a cash basis. It is not to be supposed that station agents generally are familiar with the land grant legislation or the limits of the various land grant lines, so as to be able readily to make the necessary computations. But, in any event, the well-settled practice of the government is to issue requisitions for transportation, and to require the rendition of bills therefor to be examined and audited by its \n\n[273 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n accounting officers. This method was recognized and accepted by appellant in the present case. See Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 622, 631.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOWE v. DICKSON(1927)\nNo. 158\nArgued: February 24, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., and Claude Nowlin, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Patrick H. Loughran, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[274 U.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent obtained a decree in an Oklahoma state court adjudging that a certain tract of land for which a United States pattent had been issued to Seward K. Lowe, was held by Lowe in trust for respondent. This decree was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 108 Okl. 241, 236 P. 399. The suit was brought against Seward K. Lowe and Susan Lowe, his wife. On October 4, 1926, the death of Seward K. Lowe was suggested, and Susan Lowe substituted as the sole party petitioner.\n The pertinent facts are as follows: On May 22, 1894, respondent made homestead entry of 160 acres of land, and after final proof and payment, received a patent from the government. On March 3, 1902, he made a second homestead entry of other land at the proper local land office. His affidavit accompanying the application contained the statement that he had not theretofore made an entry under the homestead laws except that he had filed upon certain described land and 'paid out on it about three years ago.' In making the second entry, respondent acted in good faith, believing at that time that his right to make it had been conferred by law. On March 6, 1902, the local land officer informed respondent that his second entry was erroneously allowed because, by his former entry, he had exhausted his homestead right; that the entry would undoubtedly be held for cancellation by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on that account; and that respondent could, if he wished, reliquish that entry and apply for the return of his fees and commissions. Respondent took no action, and the entry, in fact, was not canceled, but was intact on and after May 22, 1902. On that date, an act of Congress (section 2, c. 821, 32 Stat. 203 (Comp. St.  5015)) was passed, the effect of which was to qualify respondent to make a second homestead entry. \n\n[274 U.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n After the passage of that act, respondent continued to claim the land as a homestead.\n On March 13, 1903, Seward K. Lowe filed a contest against the second entry on a charge of abandonment, but subsequently withdrew it and instituted a new contest, January 28, 1905, charging abandonment for a period of six months and failure to improve and cultivate. June 20, 1906, the local land office found for Lowe and recommended cancellation of respondent's entry. On July 2, following, respondent made another application to enter the land as a homestead, reciting the two former entries and asserting that the second one had been erroneously allowed. This third application was rejected by the local land office on the ground that it conflicted with the subsisting second entry. Appeals to the Department of the Interior followed, respondent contending that his second entry was a nullity, and consequently not contestable, and that his third application should have been allowed under the decision in Jeremiah H. Murphy, 4 L. D. 467, holding that a subsisting void entry is no bar to a subsequent legal application by the same person. The department held that ( 1) the original invalidity of the second entry was immaterial, because respondent's continued assertion of right thereunder after the passage of the act of May 22, 1902, cured the entry and made it valid, citing prior decisions; (2) the entry having thus been validated, the rule in the Murphy Case was not applicable; and (3) the second entry having become valid, respondent was bound to pursue it in compliance with law and could not defeat a contest by electing, after the contest was waged, to treat the entry as invalid. On the merits, the charge of failure to reside upon and cultivate the land was found proved, and the entry was canceled on that ground. Lowe made homestead entry of the land, and in time received final certificate and patent. \n\n[274 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n The state Supreme Court declined to follow this holding of the department, saying that while it was supported by a number of prior departmental decisions, which were entitled to great weight, and should not be overruled, unless clearly erroneous, a controlling conclusion to the contrary had been reached by this court in Prosser v. Finn, \n208 \nU.S. 67\n, 28 S. Ct. 225.\n The Prosser Case involved the construction and application of section 452, Rev. Stats. (Comp. St.  698):\n'The officers, clerks, and employe  in the General Land Office are prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing or becoming interested in the purchase of any of the public land; and any person who violates this section shall forthwith be removed from his office.'\n\n Prosser, a special agent of the General Land Office and held to be within the terms of the statute, made a timber culture entry of certain land and complied with the law in respect to cultivation and in other particulars. His entry was contested upon the ground, among others, that it was made in violation of section 452. The contest was sustained by the local land office, and its ruling affirmed by the department. Patent for the land was issued to Finn, and Prosser brought suit for a decree adjudging that the title was held for him in trust by Finn. The ruling of the department was attacked on the ground that long prior to the initiation of the contest, Prosser had ceased to have any connection whatever with the Land Department, and his entry, therefore, was validated by removal of the disability. This court held that the statute applied; that Prossers' entry was invalid; that his continuance in possession after ceasing to be special agent was not equivalent to a new entry; and that his rights were to be determined by the validity of the original entry at the time it was made.\n Section 452 affects a class of persons having superior opportunities and power to perpetrate frauds and secure undue advantage over the general public in the acquisi- \n\n[274 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n tion of public lands. 'The purpose of the prohibition is to guard against the temptations and partiality likely to attend efforts to acquire public lands, or interests therein, by persons so situated, and thereby to prevent abuse and inspire confidence in the administration of the public- land laws.' Waskey v. Hammer, \n223 \nU.S. 85, 93\n, 32 S. Ct. 187, 189 (56 L. Ed. 359). The provision is to be so applied and enforced as to effectuate the purpose. And it is evident, that to deny an officer, clerk, or employe of the land office the right to make an entry while occupying that relationship, but to validate such an entry upon his retirement from the service, would thwart the statutory policy, since the result would be to allow the entryman still to reap the fruit of his undue advantage, superior knowledge and opportunities, and, perhaps, of his fraud, which it is the aim of the statute to forestall.\n But the restrictions of the homestead law which precluded the acquisition of a second homestead rest upon other and different considerations. The purpose of such restrictions was to limit the bounty of the United States; but, when that bounty has been extended to include an additional homestead right, the policy of the law is not infringed by allowing an entry, honestly made, though unauthorized under the old law, to stand as though made under the new law: Provided, of course, other rights have not intervened. In that case, to compel a cancellation of the unauthorized entry and the formal making of a new entry of the same land is merely to require unnecessary circuity of action to accomplish a permissible result. The Land Department for many years has uniformly held that the old entry may stand (John J. Stewart, 9 L. D. 543; George W. Blackwell, 11 L. D. 384; Smith et al. v. Taylor, 23 L. D. 440), and its decision should not be disturbed except for cogent reasons (McLaren v. Fleischer, \n256 \nU.S. 477, 481\n, 41 S. Ct. 577; United States v. Pugh, \n99 U.S. 265\n, 269), which here do not exist. On the contrary, as we \n\n[274 U.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n have indicated, the reasons convincingly are the other way. The Prosser Case would have fallen within a like principle of, while Prosser was in possession of the land and resting upon his entry, the law itself had been so altered as to remove the disqualification imposed by section 452. Such a change in the law would have manifested a change of policy, with which, as in the present case, validation of the unauthorized entry, no adverse claims intervening, would not have conflicted.\n It is well settled that, while section 2320, Rev. Stats. (Comp. St.  4615) provides explicitly that 'no location of a mining claim shall be made until the discovery of the vein or lode within the limits of the claim located,' a discovery after location will validate the location if no adverse rights have intervened. To require a new location under these circumstances 'would be a useless and idle ceremony, which the law does not require.' Mining Co. v. Tunnel Co., \n196 \nU.S. 337, 345\n, 348 S.-352, 25 S. Ct. 266 (49 L. Ed. 501); Union Oil Co. v. Smith, \n249 \nU.S. 337, 347\n, 39 S. Ct. 308; Cole v. Ralph, \n252 \nU.S. 286, 296\n, 40 S. Ct. 321. So, where an alien has made a public land entry, his subsequent naturalization or declaration of intention to become a citizen will, in the absence of adverse claims, relate back and confirm the entry. Bogan v. Edinburgh American Land Mortg. Co. (C. C. A.) 63 F. 192, 198. In Manuel v. Wulff, \n152 \nU.S. 505, 511\n, 14 S. Ct. 651, the same rule was applied in the case of a purchase of a mining claim by an alien who became a citizen pending adverse proceedings. And the rule is the same where a homestead entry has been made by a minor who comes of age prior to the inception of an adverse claim. Huff v. Geis, 71 Colo. 7, 203 P. 677; Dillard v. Hurd, 46 L. D. 51. We are unable to perceive any substantial ground for denying the applicability of the logic of these decisions to the present case.\n It follows, as the Land Department held, that Lowe's contest was filed against a validated and subsisting entry which had had the effect of segregating the land from the \n\n[274 U.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n public domain and thereby precluding the subsequent entry attempted to be made by Dickson. Holt v. Murphy, \n207 \nU.S. 407, 412\n, 28 S. Ct. 212. And since Dickson's right to relief rests entirely upon his contention to the contrary, which the state court upheld, the decree of that court must be\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAGUIRE & CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 39\nArgued: December 1, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry Peyton, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Maguire Company filed its petition, under the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505), to recover from the United States for the alleged breach of a contract made by the Surplus Property Division of the War Department for the sale of a certain quantity of waterproof duck. The Court of Claims, on its findings of fact, dismissed the petition. 59 Ct. Cl. 575. And the case was brought here by appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219), prior to the Jurisdictional Act of 1925 (43 Stat. 936).\n The basis of the Company's contention is that it purchased, pursuant to an advertisement by the Surplus Property Division, certain material listed as olive drab waterproof duck weighing 12.4 oz. per yard; that this description, according to commercial usage, referred to \n\n[273 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n the weight of the duck before it had been waterproofed, and indicated that it had weighed 12.4 oz. in that condition; but that the duck delivered under the contract, although then weighing 12.4 oz. or more, had weighed only 10.5 oz. before being waterproofed, and was of less value than the 12. 4 oz. duck which it had purchased.\n The findings of fact show that the Zone Supply Officer at Jeffersonville, Indiana, advertised for sale a list of surplus textiles containing an item No. 20, described as 121,964 yards of waterproof duck, 'width, 29 inches; color, O. D.; weight, 12.4.' Attached to this list was a letter stating that the inspection of the textiles was invited and might be made at the Supply Depot at Jeffersonville, where the material was stored; but that 'bids subject to inspection' would not be received. The Company, a New York corporation, after seeing this list and the accompanying letter, submitted, through an authorized agent, a bid for the material listed as item No. 20, at 36 1\/2 cents per yard. This was accepted by a letter in which the materials were described as 'Duck, W. P. 29 , O. D. 12.4 oz.' The Company paid the purchase price; and the Government delivered to it all the material listed in item No. 20.\n The Court of Claims also found that samples taken from this duck, both before and after delivery, weighed 13.4 oz., or more, per yard; that there were no recognized commercial standard weights of waterproof duck- the increased weight caused by waterproofing varying according to the process and ingredients used-and that it was the commercial practice to sell waterproof duck on samples without mentioning weight; and that the Government delivered to the Company 'the actual material offered and described in item No. 20' of the surplus textile list and sold by the letter of acceptance.\n In support of the judgment dismissing the petition the Court of Claims in its opinion said:\n'Neither the plain- \n\n[273 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n tiff nor its agent inspected the material before bidding or before consummating the sale. Inspection was invited by the Government, and it was expressly stated that no bids would be received subject to inspection after the bidding. The advertisement of sale and the letter accompanying it, which the plaintiff saw before bidding, put purchasers upon notice and charged them with the duty of seeing what they were buying before they bought. Purchasers were told, in effect, that if they bought something other than they thought they were buying they could not afterwards assert a claim upon the ground that they were mistaken in the character and quality of the materials . ... If the plaintiff received from the Government a different material from that which it thought it had bought it is not the fault of the Government, and the plaintiff cannot recover for its own negligence.'\n\n And:\n'As a matter of fact the Government delivered to the plaintiff exactly the material which it advertised for sale.'\n\n We think that the construction and effect of the advertisement and accompanying letter were correctly stated by the Court of Claims. In view of the specific statements in the letter that inspection of the materials was invited, and that they would not be sold subject to inspection, the description of the weight of the duck cannot be regarded as in the nature of a warranty. In this aspect the present case is analogous to Lipshitz & Cohen v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 90, 92\n, 46 S. Ct. 45. There, an agent of the United States having listed junk for sale at several forts, setting forth the weights and kinds of each, accompanied by a statement that the weights shown were approximate and must be accepted as correct by the bidder, the plaintiffs, without inspection or other information, bid a lump sum for the material, 'as is where is.' And, although the quantities turned out to be much less than that shown in the list, it was held that the plain- \n\n[273 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n tiffs had no cause of action, since the naming of quantities 'cannot be regarded as in the nature of a warranty, but merely as an estimate of the probable amounts in reference to which good faith only could be required of the party marking it.'\n This principle is conclusive of the present case. And for this reason, if no other, a motion made by the Maguire Company to remand the cause to the Court of Claims for a further finding of fact as to the weight of the duck before waterproofing, must be denied.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAMMOTH OIL CO. v.

Roberts, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Atlee Pomerene, of Cleveland, Ohio, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the United States against the petitioners in the District Court of Wyoming to secure the cancellation of an oil and gas lease made by the United States to the Mammoth Oil Company April 7, 1922, and to set aside a supplemental agreement made by the same parties February 9, 1923. An accounting and possession of the leased lands and general relief were also demanded. The complaint alleged that the lease and agreement were made without authority of law and in consummation of a conspiracy to defraud the United States. The District Court held that the transaction was authorized by the Act of June 4, 1920, 41 Stat. 812, 813 ( 34 USCA  524 (Comp. St.  2804i)), found that there was no fraud, and dismissed the case. 5 F.(2d) 330. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained that construction of the act; but, on an examination of the evidence, held that the lease and agreement were obtained by fraud and corruption, reversed the decree, and directed the District Court to enter one canceling the lease and agreement as fraudulent, enjoining petitioners from further trespassing on the leased lands, and providing for an accounting by the Mammoth Oil Company for all oil and other petroleum products taken under the lease and contract. 14 F. (2d) 705.\n The lease covered 9,321 acres in Natrona county, Wyo.-commonly known as Teapot Dome-being Naval Reserve No. 3 created April 30, 1915, by an executive order of the President made pursuant to the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847, as amended August 24, 1912, c. 369, 37 Stat. 497 (43 USCA  141-143 (Comp. St.  4523-4525)). The part of the Act of June 4, 1920, relied on to sustain the lease contains the following:\n'Provided, that the Secretary of the Navy is directed to take possession of all properties within the naval petroleum reserves ... to conserve, develop, use, and operate the same in his discretion, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange, or sell the \n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 13, 31]\n\u00a0\n oil and gas products thereof, and those from all royalty oil from lands in the naval reserves, for the benefit of the United States : ... And provided further, that such sums as have been or may be turned into the Treasury of the United States from royalties on lands within the naval petroleum reserves prior to July 1, 1921, not to exceed $500,000, are hereby made available for this purpose until July 1, 1922.'\n March 5, 1921, Edwin Denby became Secretary of the Navy and Albert B. Fall, Secretary of the Interior. May 31, 1921, the President made an order purporting to commit the administration of all oil and gas bearing lands in the naval reserves to the Secretary of the Interior, subject to the supervision of the President. The lease and agreement were signed for the United States by Fall as Secretary of the Interior and by Denby as Secretary of the Navy. The evidence shows that the latter was fully informed as to the substance of the transaction, and it is not necessary here to consider the validity or effect of the executive order.\n The purpose and scope of the lease and agreement may be indicated by a statement of their principal features. The preamble to the lease stated that it was the duty of the government to secure and store oil for the navy; that the government desired to avoid the loss of oil resulting from the drilling of wells outside the reserve, to create a market and receive the best prices obtainable for royalty oil from the Salt Creek field ( adjoining the reserve on the north), to exchange royalty oil from the reserve for fuel oil for the navy, and to secure facilities for the storage of such fuel oil; and that the government proposed to secure these objects by entering into a contract providing for the development and exploitation of the oil and gas within the reserve and for the construction of a pipe line if necessary, for the transportation of royalty oil from the reserve and from the Salt Creek field. \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 32]\n\u00a0\n The lease granted to the company the exclusive right to take and dispose of oil and gas so long as produced in paying quantities. The lessee agreed to drill test wells, and, after their completion, fully to develop the reserve, to construct, or cause its nominee to construct, a common carrier pipe line (about 1,000 miles in length) from the leased lands to a line from the mid-continent field to Chicago; to pay as royalties specified percentages of products taken from the land; to purchase all royalty oil when and as produced, and in payment to set up an oil exchange credit to the lessor and issue certificates showing the amount and value of royalty oil received by lessee. It was provided that lessee would redeem the certificates by giving lessor credit on its obligations to lessee for the construction of tanks to store fuel oil for the navy under the agreement contained in the lease for the exchange of crude oil for fuel oil storage, or by delivering to lessor fuel oil or other products of petroleum for the use of the navy, or by cash under certain conditions. And it was agreed that the lessee, when requested by the lessor, would construct or pay the cost of constructing steel tanks necessary for such storage; that lessor would pay in oil certificates of face value equal to such cost; that in exchange for crude oil lessee would deliver fuel oil and other petroleum products for the navy at places1 on the Atlantic Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Lessee agreed diligently to drill and continue operations of oil wells unless by the Secretary of the Interior \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 33]\n\u00a0\n permitted temporarily to suspend operations. And it was provided that, with the consent of the Secretary of the Interior, the lease might be terminated. By a separate agreement dated December 20, 1922, the lessee designated, and the lessor accepted, the Sinclair Pipe Line Company as the nominee of lessee to construct the pipe line, having a daily capacity of 40,000 barrels.\n The supplemental agreement of February 9, 1923, relates to storage tanks to be provided by the lessee. It deals with four projects covering construction work at Portsmouth, Melville, Boston, and Yorktown. The total capacity-some expressed in tons and some in gallons-to be constructed at these places was sufficient to store 2,550,000 tons of fuel oil, 37,500 tons and 625,000 gallons of Deisel oil, 26,500 tons and 2,330,000 gallons of gasoline, 13,800 tons and 1,161,000 gallons of lubricating oil. The lessee agreed to provide the tanks and fill them in exchange for royalty oil certificates. The government was not obligated to lessee otherwise than to deliver it oil certificates for redemption in accordance with the lease, and, until the agreement was fully performed, all certificates received by the government were to be used for constructing and filing storage for fuel oil and other petroleum products. And it was further provided that upon completion of these projects other facilities for the storage of petroleum products required by the navy were to be constructed and filled by the lessee.\n The evidence shows that the storage facilities to be furnished under the lease were to be complete reserve fuel stations, such as are known in the Appropriation Acts as 'fuel depots'; that the arrangement to use royalty oil to pay for such construction was made for the purpose of evading the requirement that the proceeds of the royalty oil, if sold, be paid into the Treasury, and to enable the Secretary of the Navy to locate, plan, and have constructed fuel stations that had not been authorized by \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 34]\n\u00a0\n Congress; that the approximate cost of construction so to be done on the Atlantic Coast would be at least $25,000,000, of that on the Pacific under arrangement with the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company $15,000, 000, and for the whole program-including the products to be put into these fuel depots when constructed-a little in excess of $100,000,000. The cost of the pipe line is not included in any of these figures. It was not deemed to be a facility merely for the development of the reserve, but was desired by those acting for the government for the transportation of oil obtained in that part of the country, to create competition in the oil market, and as an instrumentality for national defense in case of war.\n A construction of the act authorizing the agreed disposition of the reserve would conflict with the policy of the government to maintain in the ground a great reserve of oil for the navy. Joint Resolution, approved February 8, 1924, 43 Stat. 5. It would restore to the Secretary of the Navy authority of which he had recently been deprived, to construct fuel depots without express authority of Congress. Act of August 31, 1842, 5 Stat. 577 (R. S.  1552); Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 898. It would put facilities of the kind specified outside the operation of the general rule prohibiting the making of contracts of purchase or for construction work in the absence of express authority and adequate appropriations therefor. R. S.  3732, 3733 (41 USCA  11, 12 (Comp. St.  6884, 6886)); Act of June 12, 1906, 34 Stat. 255 (41 USCA  11 (Comp. St.  6885)); Act of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 764 (31 USCA  627 (Comp. St.  6763)). It would be inconsistent with the principle upon which rests the law requiring purchase money received on the sale of government property to be paid into the Treasury. R. S.  3617, 3618 (31 USCA  484, 487 (Comp. St.  6606, 6609)). While, in order to make the petroleum products available for the Navy, the Act deals with reserve lands as a separate class, there is nothing to indicate a legislative purpose to reverse the \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 35]\n\u00a0\n policy of conservation or to relax the safeguards as to fuel depots and contracts for their construction, set by prior legislation. The authority to 'store' or to 'exchange' does not empower the Secretary of the Navy to use the reserves to regulate or affect the price of oil in the Salt Creek field or to induce or aid construction of a pipe line to serve that territory. And it does not authorize the Secretary to locate the fuel stations provided for or to use the crude oil to pay for them. The Mammoth Oil Company insists that, even if other elements be held unauthorized, the transaction may be sustained as a lease granting the right to take the oil and gas in consideration of the development of the property and delivery of the royalty oils or the equivalent in cash. That view cannot prevail. The percentages of the product to be retained by the lessee includes the consideration, however indeterminate in amount, for the construction of the pipe line. Presumably, the lessee's undertaking to provide it induced the lessor to accept less than otherwise would have been asked or given. Cf. Hazelton v. Sheckels, \n202 \nU.S. 71\n, 26 S. Ct. 567, 6 Ann. Cas. 217.\n So far as concerns the power under the Act of June 4, 1920, to make them, the lease and agreement now before the court cannot be distinguished from those held to have been made without authority of law in Pan American Petroleum & Transport Co. v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 456\n, 47 S. Ct. 416; and the United States is entitled to have them canceled.\n Were the lease and supplemental agreement fraudulently made?\n The decisions below are in conflict, and we have considered the evidence to determine whether it establishes the charge. The complaint states that the lease and agreement were made as the result of a conspiracy by Fall and H. F. Sinclair to defraud the United States; that Fall acted for the United States and Sinclair acted for \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 36]\n\u00a0\n the Mammoth Oil Company; that the negotiations were secret, and the lease was made without competition; that responsible persons and corporations desiring to obtain leases were by Fall, in collusion with Sinclair, denied opportunity to become competitors of the Mammoth Company; that a company known as the Pioneer Oil Company asserted a mining claim to lands in the reserve; that the claim was worthless and known to be so by Fall; that he had Sinclair procure a quitclaim deed covering the valueless claim, and then, to make it impossible for others to compete with Sinclair's company, Fall made its transfer condition the granting of the lease; that Fall agreed with one Shaffer that Sinclair would cause a part of the leased lands to be set aside for the benefit of Shaffer, and required Sinclair, in order to get the lease for the Mammoth Company, to agree that Shaffer should have a sublease on some of the land; that, before and after the making of the lease, Fall kept the negotiations and execution secret from his associates, the Congress, and the public; and, in general terms, the complaint charges that Fall and Sinclair conspired to defraud the government by making the lease without authority and in violation of law and to favor and prefer the Mammoth Company over others.\n As is usual in cases where conspiracy to defraud is involved, there is here no direct evidence of the corrupt arrangement. Neither of the alleged conspirators was called as a witness. The question is whether the disclosed circumstances prove the charge. When Fall became Secretary, Reserve No. 3 had already attracted the attention of oil operators. His predecessor, Secretary Payne, had arranged to offer highest bidders 15 lease in the Salt Creek field. These covered areas ranging from 160 to 640 acres, amounting in all to 6,400 acres. The royalties averaged 28.76 per cent. June 15, 1921, the leases were auctioned. Bonuses offered in excess of the \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 37]\n\u00a0\n specified royalties amounted in all to $1,687,000, and the leases were granted on that basis. That field was very productive. The reserve compared favorable with it, and was considered very attractive by all having knowledge of the structure. Obviously oil men would be interested in the opening of the reserve and the putting of its product on the market.\n From the beginning Fall was keen to control the leasing of the naval petroleum reserves. Commander H. A. Stuart had been put in charge of naval reserve matters by Secretary Daniels; he continued as special aide to Denby, and was well qualified for that service. Early in April, 1921, Fall asked Assistant Secretary Edward C. Finney, who had long been in the Interior Department, to suggest some one who could handle naval reserve matters. Finney recommended, and Fall appointed, Dr. W. C. Mendenhall of the Geological Survey. Early in May, Fall had a memorandum prepared by Finney to disclose what power or authority in respect of the reserves could be delegated to Fall. Finney reported that the President might commit to the Secretary of the Interior the authorization of such additional wells or leases within the naval reserves as the President by section 18 of the Leasing Act (30 USCA  227) was empowered to permit or grant; that under the Act of June 4, 1920, the Secretary of the Navy might request him to handle the conservation, development and operation of the naval reserves. And May 11, Fall sent Denby a letter inclosing for his approval a draft of a proposed executive order and a form of letter addressed to the President to be signed by Denby, requesting that the order be made. Fall said:\n'Referring to our conversation yesterday, and to your suggestion to the President that the Secretary of the Interior be placed in charge of administration of the laws relating to naval reserves, I am submitting herewith for your consideration a brief memorandum stating the facts and law with respect to naval reserves, a tentative form \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 38]\n\u00a0\n of letter for your signature if it meets with your approval, and a form of executive order for the President's signature if it meets your suggestions of yesterday. ... If they meet with your approval and no changes occur to you, kindly return them with your approval, in order that the matter may be taken up with the President.'\n\n While this letter contains language calculated to indicate that Denby initiated the matter, the context and attending facts clearly show that Fall was eager to get the authority proposed to be given him.\n Denby was not called as a witness, but the circumstances indicate that he intended to be passive and let Fall dominate. He sent Fall's form of executive order to Assistant Secretary Roosevelt and the Chief of the Bureau of Engineering, Admiral R. S. Griffin. After consideration of the matter by them and other officers of the navy, including Commanders Stuart, J. F. Shafroth, and E. A. Cobey, the Assistant Secretary told Denby that he thought that the property should not be turned over to the Interior Department. Denby replied that the matter had been decided by the President, Fall, and himself. Later the Assistant Secretary took to Denby a suggestion, prepared by him and his associates, for the amendment of the proposed order. Denby said: 'If you can get Fall to agree to this modification, then it will be all right with me.' Fall agreed to the change, and the President signed the form of order as amended. Its pertinent provisions follow:\n'The administration and conservation of all oil and gas bearing lands in naval petroleum reserves ... are hereby committed to the Secretary of the Interior subject to the supervision of the President, but no general policy as to drilling or reserving lands located in a naval reserve shall be changed or adopted except upon consultation and in co-operation with the Secretary or Acting Secretary of the Navy.'\n\n We italicize words added as a result of the suggestion of Denby's subordinates. The executive \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 39]\n\u00a0\n order as signed by the President was what Fall wanted, and, so far as concerns the matters here involved, it was not substantially different from the draft he submitted to Denby.\n Soon after the order was made, 22 offset wells in Reserve No. 1 were given to companies represented by E. L. Doheny and one McMurray, respectively. In connection with that matter, Fall had some trouble with Mendenhall and Stuart, and expressed himself as 'dissatisfied with both of them.' Thereafter neither of them was given anything to do in respect of reserve leases. July 8, 1921, Fall wrote Doheny a letter containing the following:\n'There will be no possibility of any further conflict with navy officials and this Department, as I have notified Secretary Denby that I should conduct the matter of naval leases, under the direction of the President, without calling any of his force in consultation unless I conferred with himself personally upon a matter of policy. He understands the situation and that I shall handle matters exactly as I think best and will not consult with any officials of any bureau of his department, but only with himself, and such consultation will be confined strictly and entirely to matters of general policy.'\n\n This exultant declaration that he was in position to handle these vast properties as he pleased discredits Fall. His desire to get control of the reserves and then so proclaim that he had it strongly suggests that he was willing to conspire against the public interest. And that inference is confirmed by his subsequent conduct.\n By letter to Denby of July 23, Fall suggested the thought that royalty oil might be used to pay for fuel depots to be located and planned by the navy. That idea seems not to have originated in the navy. Such use of royalty oil was an essential element in any arrangement involving the prompt exhaustion of the reserves. It was the foundation of the scheme culminating in the lease. Denby, by letter to Fall of July 29, indicated his \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 40]\n\u00a0\n acquiescence. Soon thereafter Fall left Washington for the West, declaring that he was going to discuss the matter with oil men, 'with the idea of working up some such arrangement.' He returned about the middle of October. In the meantime Admiral John K. Robison was appointed to succeed Admiral Griffin as Chief of the Engineering Bureau. Denby directed Robison to take personal charge of all naval petroleum matters. Commander Stuart was relieved from all duties in reference to them. The record shows no reason for the removal of Stuart, but it does appear that Fall favored the change and that Denby knew it.\n Immediately after he was given charge, Robison investigated and found that Reserves Nos. 1 and 2 were suffering loss from drainage and that Reserve No. 3 was not. He testified that he thought the latter pretty secure but not absolutely so. He read Fall's letter of July 23, suggesting the use of royalty oil to pay for storage tanks, and he made working arrangements with Fall, which were confirmed by a letter of October 25, prepared by Robison and signed by Denby and sent to Fall. They agreed that Fall was to control the making of all leases for the drilling of wells in the naval reserves and for the disposition of the products; that he would have necessary offset wells drilled in Reserves Nos. 1 and 2, but that the development of Reserve No. 3 would not be undertaken except to protect it against depletion by others; that the navy was to receive fuel oil for royalty oil; that so much of the royalty oil as was not exchanged for fuel oil would be used to obtain storage at places to be designated by the navy; and that the terms of the coversion should be submitted to the navy for approval as to qualities, deliveries, engineering, and other features involved.\n Denby did not actively participate; but, in conferences with Fall, he was represented by Robison. Fall personally conducted the negotiations with Sinclair. And \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 41]\n\u00a0\n he contemporaneously arranged with Doheny the contract that was set aside for fraud in the Pan American Case, supra. Under the Secretary, Finney usually acted for the United States in making oil and gas leases, and he was authorized to sign them. But he was not consulted as to the terms of the naval reserve leases made to the Mammoth Company represented by Sinclair or to the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company represented by Doheny, Robison through Fall undoubtedly exerted influence as to the provisions for the pipe line and fuel stations, but Fall acted for the United States and dominated in all matters substantially affecting the value of the lease. And it is significant that by the terms of the lease the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to permit the lessee temporarily to suspend production or to assign or terminate the lease.\n November 30, at a meeting of the Secretary's Council, consisting of important officers in the navy, Robison advised, and it was decided, that the oil reserves should not be used to supply fuel oil for current use. He urged that leases be made and royalty oil exchanged for fuel oil and storage constructed by the lessees at places to be designated by the navy. Denby at first queried whether the exchange was authorized by law, and Robison called for the advice of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. He answered affirmatively and, in the course of his opinion, said:\n'The authority granted 'to exchange' is unrestricted; i. e., the act does not specify nor limit what may be taken in exchange for the oil and its products.'\n\n Denby approved the opinion and authorized the proposed exchange. Robison prepared a letter, which Denby signed and sent to Fall, quoting the Judge Advocate General, and stating that Denby desired the Interior Department to make exchanges of crude oil for fuel oil and storage and that Robison had been designated to handle the details. \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 42]\n\u00a0\n Then Fall went to his ranch at Three Rivers, N. M., where, December 31, came Sinclair and his counsel, J. W. Zevely, to see him, as the latter testified, on some business connected with Osage Indian leases. They remained two days. The showing as to what transpired concerning the Teapot Dome is meager. The record contains no statement from Fall or Sinclair. H. F. Bain, Director of the Bureau of Mines, was there for a day, but the leasing of the reserve was not mentioned in his hearing. Zevely testified that he was not sure whether the subject was mentioned in his presence, but he thought inquiry was made of Fall as to whether he would lease the Teapot Dome, and that Fall said he was having an investigation made, 'and upon that report he would probably determine whether or not he would lease' it. Nothing more is directly disclosed. But, soon after Fall and Sinclair met at the ranch, Fall caused his office force to investigate pending claims to land in the reserve and directed a report to be made to him on his return. Evidently he was considering leasing the reserve as a whole.\n Fall reached Washington January 27, and, after conference with Robison, it was decided to develop all of Reserve No. 3. He sent for Sinclair and Zevely and had Robison tell them what would be necessary in any proposal for a lease. Robison told Sinclair that the whole reserve should be developed, that a pipe line adequate to serve the field should be constructed, and that royalty oil should be used to obtain fuel oil and to pay for storage facilities. And February 3, Sinclair wrote to Fall, stating that he was willing to take out all the oil in the reserve on a royalty basis and specifying features substantially the same as those suggested to him by Robison. He also proposed to quiet all outstanding claims and so enable the government to make one lease covering the whole reserve. His letter argued against granting leases by auction, as- \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 43]\n\u00a0\n serted that the reserve was being drained, and insisted that it was better to have oil stored where needed than to keep the reserve underground. On receipt of the letter, Fall conferred with Sinclair and directed Arthur W. Ambrose, chief petroleum technologist of the Department, to give him an estimate of the quantity of oil in the reserve and 'some idea as to the possibilities of drainage.' February 18, Ambrose reported that he estimated 360,270,000 barrels in the Salt Creek field and 135,050,000 barrels in the reserve. His report disclosed no immediate danger of drainage but only a possibility of loss 'during the next six or seven years.' About that date Fall called Ambrose into his office where Sinclair and Zevely were, and, outlining certain provisions he wanted, directed that a draft of lease be prepared. The work of preparation required two or three weeks, and most of it was done in Zevely's office in Washington. Questions concerning its provisions arising from time to time were referred to Fall and Sinclair; they settled all the terms of the lease. The draft was not submitted to any lawyer in the Interior Department.\n The Pioneer Oil & Refining Company and the Socie te Belgo-Americaine des Petroles du Wyoming had asserted placer mining claims to lands in the reserve. In 1917, the Department fully investigated and found these claims were without merit. In 1920, Secretary Payne held them invalid and denied application for a lease. In March, 1921, Assistant Secretary Finney dismissed claimants' petition for rehearing. Later they filed a petition to invoke the supervisory power of the Secretary. Answering an inquiry from Fall, Finney told him that the claims 'had no validity and no standing.' The last petition had not been heard when Fall and Sinclair met at the ranch. The report that Fall called for was ready before he returned to Washington; it stated that there were no claims deserving serious consideration. Obviously, Sinclair's pro- \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 44]\n\u00a0\n posal to quiet outstanding claims was the result of an understanding with Fall.\n February 28, 1922, Sinclair caused the Mammoth Company to be organized. It promptly obtained from the Pioneer and Belgo Companies quitclaim deeds of all the reserve lands, and agreed with them that, in the event of obtaining a lease covering the lands, it would pay them $200, 000 within 18 months and $800,000 more out of one-third of the value of the gross production less royalties. March 11, Sinclair wrote Fall submitting the Mammoth Company's formal application for a lease. He said that, if the lease were granted, he would become owner of all the capital stock of the company and would personally guarantee performance of the contract. He submitted a form of lease-presumably that already prepared in co-operation with Fall-all inclosed the company's quitclaim deed to the United States of all that was conveyed to it by the Pioneer and Belgo Companies. The record shows that, after he knew that the Mammoth had obtained these deeds, Fall told some who sought to lease the reserve that he would require the lessee to satisfy or clear up outstanding claims. In March, after much time had been spent in preparing the lease, Fall told a representative of a company seeking a lease that he was not ready at that time to consider leasing the reserve, and that, if he did so decide, he would notify the applicant. To one acting for another company, who called about April 10 to submit an offer for a lease, Fall indicated that he would entertain a bid, and said that he would be glad to see representatives of the company at Three Rivers. The lease had been signed by Fall April 7.\n March 16, 1922, John C. Shaffer called on Fall concerning an earlier application for a lease covering a specified tract of 600 acres in the reserve. Fall said he was then negotiating with Sinclair for a lease covering the reserve. Shaffer insisted upon having some of it, and Fall said he had told Sinclair to set aside 200 acres for Shaffer. And \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 45]\n\u00a0\n when Shaffer demanded more, Fall advised him to see Sinclair, adding 'I think you will find him a very reasonable man, and you probably will make satisfactory arrangements with him.' Shaffer went to New York and saw Sinclair. The latter said that Fall had told him to reserve 200 acres for Shaffer. Shaffer demanded 600 acres, protracted negotiations between them followed, and it does not appear that any agreement was ever reached. Fall's arrangement with Sinclair for a sublease to Shaffer was extraordinary, and indicates that he had favored the Mammoth Company and that Sinclair on that account had assumed obligations not expressed in the lease.\n About March 30 a rough draft of the lease was given Robison. April 7, Fall signed as Secretary of the Interior and 'for the Secretary of the Navy.' It was thought desirable, whether necessary or not, that Denby should sign, and, about April 12, he did so. Then Fall about to leave for New Mexico, told Finney that the lease had been executed, and locked it and copies in his desk. He said that 'he didn't want it to get out' until after the consummation of the contract (that set aside in the Pan American Case) for the construction of storage tanks, etc., at Pearl Harbor. He wrote Denby, inclosing a copy, and stating that delivery of the lease had been made to the lessee; that he had instructed his office force to give out nothing; that he was particularly anxious that no details should be disclosed pending the completion of the other contract. And, in order to support his refusal to furnish a Senator information concerning these contracts, Fall insisted that they should not be given out because military plans were involved. After Fall left, inquiries were made at the Department, but all information was withheld. When demand became more insistent, Fall wired his office to notify Sinclair to furnish a surety company bond, 'in view of congressional agitation,' instead of Sin- \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 46]\n\u00a0\n clair's personal bond theretofore accepted. About April 21, information concerning the lease was given in response to a Senate resolution. There was never any legitimate reason for secrecy.\n The Mammoth Company insists that the lease was made to protect the reserve from loss by drainage. The trial court did not pass upon the matter. The Circuit Court of Appeals found there was a remote but not immediate danger. It said (page 719):\n'The drainage danger was unquestionably not imminent enough to force immediate action in the leasing of the entire property.'\n\n That fact is satisfactorily established. A discussion of the evidence is not necessary. The circumstances, terms of the arrangement, and testimony of witnesses show that the lease and agreement were not made to prevent drainage. While the negotiations were pending, Fall and Sinclair indicated that they thought such danger existed, but the evidence warrants a finding that their expressions were made in bad faith to make it appear that there was a reason for the exhaustion of the reserve and the proposed disposition of its products.\n In January, 1922, Fall was informed that counsel for certain oil companies had held that the use of royalty oil to pay for fuel depots was not authorized by law. He expressed fear that, because of the 'question as to the legality of bartering of royalty oil for storage, people would not bid for this contract and lease in California.' But he refused to submit the question to the Attorney General; and, as a reason for not taking such legal advice, said that 'the chances were at least even, or at least there was some chance' that an adverse opinion would be given, 'and, if the Attorney General signed such as opinion, ... he (Fall) would be estopped from going anything.' And on April 12, the day that Denby signed the lease, Fall asked him to procure the adoption of an amendment to the pending naval appropriation bill, providing \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 47]\n\u00a0\n that storage for fuel oil from the reserves might be obtained by exchange of oil or by use of cash received for royalty oil sold. Fall sent Denby a draft of the amendment and undoubtedly thought its adoption would authorize the exchange of oil for the storage facilities contemplated by the lease. Under the circumstances, his failure to submit the lease to the Attorney General or to any lawyer in his own Department indicates that he knew that the transaction was liable to be condemned as illegal, and that, without regard to the law, he intended to put it through.\n Shortly after the making of the lease, Fall received from a hidden source a large amount of Liberty Bonds, and others were used for his benefit. The substance of the disclosed circumstances follows. A. E. Humphreys controlled two oil-producing companies. H. M. Blackmer was chairman of the board of the Midwest Refining Company, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. The latter and the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation owned share and share alike the Pipe Line Company and Purchasing Company. November 15, Humphreys, his counsel, Charles S. Thomas, Blackmer, Sinclair, and James E. O'Neit, president of the Prairie Oil & Gas Company, met in New York. It was there understood that Humphreys' companies would sell to Blackmer at $1.50 a barrel half their production up to 33,333,333 barrels, and also that they would sell at prices current in the field to the Prairie Company and the Purchasing Company half the production after delivery of the oil so sold to Blackmer. The same persons and R. W. Stewart, president of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana, met the next day. It was then understood that, instead of Blackmer, the Continental Trading Company, Limited, would be the purchaser in the first transaction, and that performance on its part would be guaranteed by the Prairie Company and the Purchasing Company. The \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 48]\n\u00a0\n papers were so drawn. On the same day, Henry Smith Osler, a barrister of Toronto, caused application to be made to the Secretary of State for Canada for the incorporation of the Continental Company. The next day he attended a meeting of the same persons and executed the contract on behalf of that company. Its performance was guaranteed as arranged, O'Neil acting for the Prairie Company and Sinclair and Stewart for the Purchasing Company. At the same time the Continental Company and these guarantors made a contract by which the latter bought all the oil so purchased by the Continental Company and assumed all its obligations. On the price basis specified, the gain of the Continental would be at least 25 cents per barrel and under some circumstances might be more. The Continental was to receive payments for the oil on the 10th of each month, but was not bound to pay the producers before the 15th. So it was assured profit of at least 25 cents per barrel without financing or effort of any kind. As permitted by Canada law, it issued share warrants to bearer with dividend coupons attached; except for qualifying shares, it put out no stock, did no other business, and kept no accounts. All its financial transactions were handled by the New York agency of the Dominion Bank of Canada. There was found no record disclosing who were financially interested in the company or entitled to dividends paid by it. Pursuant to Osler's instructions, the New York agency on April 13 and April 17, 1922, bought Liberty bonds of $ 300,000 par value; and, on May 8 following, Osler, as president of the Continental Company, gave the agency a receipt for Liberty bonds of that amount. There were other similar transactions; and, between February, 1922, and June, 1923, like purchases and deliveries amounted to more than $3,000, 000. In May, 1923, the Continental Company assigned its contract with the Humphreys' companies to its guarantors for $400,000. Shortly afterwards, it was dissolved, and all its records were destroyed. \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 49]\n\u00a0\n May 29, 1922, at Pueblo, Colo., Fall's son-in-law, M. T. Everhart, had $230,500 in Liberty bonds. Of that amount, $200,000 were, by the numbers thereon, conclusively shown to have been included in the lots purchased by the New York agency, April 13 and April 17, and receipted for by Osler May 8. Everhart gave the First National Bank of Pueblo bonds for $ 90,000 to be kept for Fall. He sold the balance to the M. D. Thatcher Estates Company at par and accrued interest. Fall and Everhart owned all the stock of the Tres Ritos Cattle & Land Company. The Thatcher Company had loaned the cattle company $10,000. Fall $15,000, and Everhart $83,000, and for security held all the stock of that company. Out of the proceeds of the bonds, Everhart paid these debts. The balance was distributed to the company, Fall, and Everhart. Out of the $90,000 in bonds given to the bank for Fall, $20,000 were deposited to the credit of the cattle company, and the rest was sent to Fall. In October and November, 1922, he sold $20, 000 in Texas; and, in May, 1923, $50,000 in New Mexico. The government called Everhart as a witness; but, invoking the rule against compulsory self-incrimination, he declined to give any information as to where he got the bonds.\n Humphreys and his counsel testified but were unable to disclose who were financially interested in the Continental Company. Blackmer and O'Neil went to France; and, on the application of the government, letters rogatory issued, but they refused to testify. Subpoena was issued for Stewart, but the marshal returned that he could not be found. Commissions were appointed to take the deposition of Osler in Canada. He was sworn but declined to disclose who caused him to organize the Continental Company or to give information as to its owners or the distribution of its assets. As ground for the refusal, he asserted that the information called for was privileged because communicated to or obtained by him in the course \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 50]\n\u00a0\n of his employment as a professional legal adviser, and that the company and its officers were his confidential agents for the better performance of his duties to his client. Application was made to the Supreme Court of Ontario to compel him to testify. That court held he must answer (56 O. L. R. 307); and its judgment was affirmed on appeal (56 O. L. R. 635). The District Court, on defendants' objections, refused to delay the trial pending final decision in the Canada courts, and thereafter refused to reopen the case in order to get Osler's testimony.\n The creation of the Continental Company, the purchase and resale contracts enabling it to make more than $8,000,000 without capital, risk, or effort, the assignment of the contract to the resale purchasers for a small fraction of its probable value, and the purpose to conceal the disposition of its assets, make it plain that the company was created for some illegitimate purpose. And the clandestine and unexplained acquisition of these bonds by Fall confirms the belief, generated by other circumstances in the case, that he was a faithless public officer. There is nothing in the record that tends to mitigate the sinister significance attaching to that enrichment.\n Fall ceased to be Secretary, March 4, 1923. Shortly afterwards, Sinclair gave him $25,000 under these circumstances. Sinclair, about to go to Russia on business, had Zevely arrange with Fall to meet him there. Fall was given $10,000 for expenses; and May 26, 1923, Sinclair directed his secretary, Wahlberg, to give Zevely bonds for $25,000 if the latter asked for them. A few days later, Zevely obtained the bonds, and, at Fall's request, had them sent to the First National Bank of El Paso. Zevely wrote the bank that the package belonged to Fall. By direction of Fall, the bank sold the bonds and gave him credit for the proceeds, $25, 671.36. Zevely testified concerning the transaction before the Senate Committee on Public Lands, and that testimony was introduced at the trial by the \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 51]\n\u00a0\n defendants. Its substance was that Zevely went to New Mexico to see Fall because he did not want to write about the matter; that, in addition to the expense money, Fall wanted $25,000 to buy one or two small ranches there; that Zevely so reported to Sinclair, who said, 'If he does, you will have to let him have it;' that later Zevely had Wahlberg, who did not know the bonds were for Fall, send them to the designated bank; that the bonds were not given as a fee but as a loan from Sinclair; that, after Fall's return from Russia, he gave Zevely a note for $25,000 which the latter still held. Fall allowed the proceeds of the bonds to remain in the bank for a long time, and it does not appear that he ever bought the ranches. It is obvious that this was not a straightforward transaction. Coming so soon after the supplemental agreement made to perfect and carry out the scheme, it strengthens and confirms the inference that Fall had been willing to conspire to defraud the United States; and, taken in connection with other circumstances disclosed, it is persuasive evidence of such a conspiracy between him and Sinclair.\n Familiar rules govern the consideration of the evidence. As said by Lord Mansfield in Blatch v. Archer (Cowper 63, 65):\n'It is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other to have contradicted.'\n\n The record shows that the government, notwithstanding the diligence reasonably to be expected, was unable to obtain the testimony of Blackmer, O'Neil, Stewart, Everhart, or Osler in respect of the transaction by which the Liberty bonds recently acquired by the Continental Company were given to and used for Fall. All the record contains nothing to indicate that the petitioners controlled any of them, or did anything to prevent the government from obtaining their testimony, or that they or the evidence they might have given was within petitioners' power. But the failure of \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 52]\n\u00a0\n Sinclair to testify stands on a different basis. Having introduced evidence which, uncontradicted and unexplained, was sufficient to sustain its charge, the United States was not required to call the principal representative of the company. His silence makes strongly against the company. It is as if he personally held the lease, were defendant, and failed to testify. The guiding considerations by which the proper significance of such silence is to be ascertained were well stated by Chief Justice Shaw in the celebrated case of Commonwealth v. Webster, 5 Cush. (Mass.) 295, 316 (52 Am. Dec. 711):\n'Where, for instance, probable proof is brought of a state of facts tending to criminate the accused, the absence of evidence tending to a contrary conclusion is to be considered, though not alone entitled to much weight; because the burden of proof lies on the accuser to make out the whole case by substantive evidence. But, when pretty stringent proof of circumstances is produced, tending to support the charge, and it is apparent that the accused is so situated that he could offer evidence of all the facts and circumstances as they existed, and show, if such was the truth, that the suspicious circumstances can be accounted for consistently with his innocence, and he fails to offer such proof, the natural conclusion is that the proof, if produced, instead of rebutting, would tend to sustain the charge. But this is to be cautiously applied, and only in cases where it is manifest that proofs are in the power of the accused, not accessible to the prosecution.'\n\n While Sinclar's failure to testify cannot properly be held to supply any fact not reasonably supported by the substantive evidence in the case ( Northern R. Co. v. Page, \n274 \nU.S. 65, 74\n, 47 S. Ct. 491), it justly may be inferred that he was not in position to combat or explain away any fact or circumstance so supported by evidence and material to the government's case. Runkle v. Burnham, \n153 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 14 S. Ct. 837; Kirby v. Tallmadge, 160 U. S. \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 53]\n\u00a0\n 379, 383, 16 S. Ct. 349; Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 \nU.S. 149, 154\n, 44 S. Ct. 54; Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, \n273 \nU.S. 103, 111\n, 47 S. Ct. 302; Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 247; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Elliott (C. C. A.) 102 F. 96, 102. As to facts appearing to have been within the knowledge or power of Sinclair, we find that the evidence establishes all that it fairly and reasonably tends to prove.\n The complaint did not allege bribery; and, in the view we take of the case, there is no occasion to consider, and we do not determine, whether Fall was bribed in respect of the lease or agreement. It was not necessary for the government to show that it suffered or was liable to suffer loss or disadvantage as a result of the lease or that Fall gained by or was financially concerned in the transaction. Pan American Case, supra, \n273 \nU.S. 456\n, 47 S. Ct. 416. It requires no discussion to make it plain that the facts and circumstances above referred to require a finding that, pending the making of the lease and agreement, Fall and Sinclair, contrary to the government's policy for the conservation of oil reserves for the navy, and in disregard of law, conspired to procure for the Mammoth Company all the products of the reserve on the basis of exchange of royalty oil for construction work, fuel oil, etc.; that Fall so favored Sinclair and the making of the lease and agreement that it was not possible for him loyally or faithfully to serve the interests of the United States or impartially to consider the applications of others for leases in the reserve; and that the lease and agreement were made fraudulently by means of collusion and conspiracy between them.\n The lease gave the Mammoth Company the right to construct tanks and other operating facilities on the reserve. In January, 1923, the petitioner, Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing Company, bought from that company the tanks already constructed and others being built thereon. It used them to store Salt Creek royalty oil that it bought \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 54]\n\u00a0\n from the government. It claims that it relied on the validity of the lease and became the owner of the tanks as licensee and grantee of the lessee, and entitled to maintain them in all respects as the lessee was entitled to do under the lease. It contends that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in directing it to be restrained from further trespassing upon the reserve, and that in any event it should be given opportunity to remove its property. But the Purchasing Company is presumed to have known that no law authorized the making of any such lease. The existence of that arrangement for the exhaustion of the reserve was calculated to excite the apprehensions of one considering such a purchase and put him on his guard rather than to give assurance of safety. The use of such tanks to take oil from the reserve was a part of the illegal scheme. Moreover, the Purchasing Company was owned half and half by the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation and the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. Sinclair was chairman of the board of the former, and Stewart held like position in the latter. Shortly before the Purchasing Company bought the tanks, these chairmen acted for and controlled it in respect of most important transactions. That and other disclosed circumstances are sufficient to impute to it Sinclair's knowledge of the conspiracy to defraud by which the lease was obtained. It is clear that, in respect of the use and removal of these tanks, the Purchasing Company is in no better position than the Mammoth Company would have occupied, if it owned them.\n The Sinclair Pipe Line Company, as lessee's nominee to build the pipe line provided for in the lease, expended a large amount in constructing on the reserve a pumping station, pipe line and other equipment necessary for the transportation of the oil therefrom. It asserts that it relied on the validity of the lease, had no knowledge of \n\n[275 U.S. 13, 55]\n\u00a0\n any fraud in its procurement, and made these expenditures in good faith. It contends that it should have opportunity to procure from governmental authorities a right to use the reserve lands for the operation of the pipe line and equipment thereon; and, failing to get a right of way or easement for that purpose, it should be allowed to remove its property. That company was also owned half and half by the Consolidated Company and the Standard Company. It was a mere nominee to do some of the work specified in the lease to be performed by the lessee. It is chargeable with notice that the use of reserve oil to procure the construction of the pipe line was a part of the plan for the unauthorized exhaustion of the reserve; that such use furthered the violation of law and was contrary to the established conservation policy. The Pipe Line Company stands on no better ground than the lessee would have occupied if it had made the improvements in question.\n The tanks, pipe line, and other improvements put upon the reserve for the purpose of taking away its products were not authorized by Congress. The lease and supplemental agreement were fraudulently made to circumvent the law and to defeat public policy. No equity arises in favor of the lessee or the other petitioners to prevent or condition the granting of the relief directed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Petitioners are bound to restore title and possession of the reserve to the United States, and must abide the judgment of Congress as to the use or removal of the improvements or other relief claimed by them.

S.(1927)\nNo. 185\nArgued: October 12, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hugh L. Smith, and Benjamin L. McKinley, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 17, 1924, the above-named petitioner, one Birdsall, and five others were indicted in the Southern division of the Northern district of California. It was charged that they conspired to commit various offenses against the National Prohibition Act, including the maintenance of a nuisance at 1249 Polk street, San Francisco. Section 37, Criminal Code (U. S. C. tit. 18,  88 (18 USCA  88)). One defendant was never apprehended; one was acquitted; the rest were found guilty. Of these, Marron, Birdsall, and two others obtained review in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The judgment was affirmed as to all except petitioner. He secured reversal and a new trial. 8 F.(2d) 251. He was again found guilty, and the conviction was affirmed, 18 F.(2d) 218.\n Petitioner insists that a ledger and certain bills were obtained through an illegal search and seizure and put in evidence against him, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The question arose at the first trial. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the book and papers were lawfully seized and admissible. When the second conviction was before it, that court held the earlier decision governed the trial, established the law of the case, and foreclosed further consideration.\n For some time prior to October 1, 1924, petitioner was the lessee of the entire second floor of 1249 Polk street. On that day a prohibition agent obtained from a United States commissioner a warrant for the search of that place, particularly describing the things to be seized- intoxicating liquors and articles for their manufacture. The next day, four prohibition agents went to the place and secured admission by causing the doorbell to be rung. There were six or seven rooms, containing slot machines, \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n an ice box, tables, chairs, and a cash register. The evidence shows that the place was used for retailing and drinking intoxicating liquors. About a dozen men and women were there, and some of them were being furnished intoxicating liquors. The petitioner was not there; Birdsall was in charge. The agents handed him the warrant and put him under arrest. They searched for and found large quantities of liquor, some of which were in a closet. While in the closet, they noticed a ledger showing inventories of liquors, receipts, expenses, including gifts to police officers, and other things relating to the business. And they found, beside the cash register, a number of bills against petitioner for gas, electric light, water, and telephone service furnished on the premises. They seized the ledger and bills. The return made on the search warrant showed only the seizure of the intoxicating liquors. It did not show the discovery or seizure of the ledger or bills. After indictment and before trial, petitioner applied to the court for the return of the ledger and bills and to suppress evidence concerning them. The application was denied. At the trial there was evidence to show that petitioner made most of the entries in the ledger and that he was concerned as proprietor or partner in carrying on the business of selling intoxicating liquors.\n It has long been settled that the Fifth Amendment protects every person against incrimination by the use of evidence obtained through search or seizure made in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Agnello v. United States, \n269 U.S. 20\n, 34, and cases cited, 46 S. Ct. 4.\n The petitioner insists that because the ledger and bills were not described in the warrant and as he was not arrested with them on his person, their seizure violated the Fourth Amendment. The United States contends that the seizure may be justified either as an incident to the execution of the search warrant, or as an incident to the \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n right of search arising from the arrest of Birdsall while in charge of the saloon. Both questions are presented. Lower courts have expressed divers views in respect of searches in similar cases. The brief for the government states that the facts of this case present one of the most frequent causes of appeals in current cases. And for these reasons we deal with both contentions.\n\n 1. \nThe Fourth Amendment declares that the right to be secure against unreasonable searches shall not be violated, and it further declares that:\n'No warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n General searches have long been deemed to violate fundamental rights. It is plain that the amendment forbids them. In Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, page 624, 6 S. Ct. 524, 529 (29 L. Ed. 746), Mr. Justice Bradley, writing for the court, said:\n'In order to ascertain the nature of the proceedings intended by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution under the terms 'unreasonable searches and seizures,' it is only necessary to recall the contemporary or then recent history of the controversies on the subject, both in this country and in England. The practice had obtained in the colonies of issuing writs of assistance to the revenue officers, empowering them, in this discretion, to search suspected places for smuggled goods, which James Otis pronounced 'the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law book,' since they placed 'the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\"\n\n And in Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, page 391, 34 S. Ct. 341, 344 (58 L. Ed. 652, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177) Mr. Justice Day, writing for the court, said:\n'The effect of the 4th Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and federal officials, in the \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the exercise of such power and authority, and to forever secure the people, their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law. This protection reaches all alike, whether accused of crime or not, and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all intrusted under our federal system with the enforcement of the laws. The tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions ... should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts, which are charged at all times with the support of the Constitution, and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for the maintenance of such fundamental rights.'\n\n The requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\n And the Congress in enacting the laws governing the issue and execution of this search warrant was diligent to limit seizures to things particularly described. Section 39 of title 27, U. S. C. (27 USCA  39), provides that such warrant may issue as provided in title 18,  611 to 631 and  633 (18 USCA  611-631, 633).1 Section 613 provides that a search warrant cannot be issued but upon probable cause supported by affidavit naming or describing the person and particularly describing property and place to be searched. Section \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n 622 requires the officer executing the warrant to give to the person in whose possession the property taken was found a receipt specifying it in detail. Section 623 requires him forthwith to return the warrant to the judge or commissioner with a verified inventory and detailed account of the property taken. Section 624 gives the person from whom the property is taken a right to have a copy of the inventory. Section 626 provides that, if it appears that the property or paper taken is not the same as that described in the warrant, the judge or commissioner must cause it to be returned to the person from whom it was taken. And section 631 provides for punishment of an officer who willfully exceeds his authority in executing a search warrant.\n The government relies on Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585\n, 24 S. Ct. 372. That was a prosecution in a state court. It involved no search or seizure under a law, or by an officer, of the United States. Adams was convicted of having gambling paraphernalia in violation of the Penal Code of New York. It appeared that he occupied an office where were his desk, trunk, tin boxes and other articles. Officers came and stated that they had a search warrant. He said it was not his office. They arrested him, searched the place, found 'policy slips,' etc., and also papers relating to his private affairs. The policy papers were introduced in evidence. There were indorsements in his handwriting on some of them. Over his objection, the private papers were received to furnish specimens of his writing and to show that he occupied the office. He had taken no steps to secure the return of his private papers or to prevent their use as evidence. But at the trial he contended their seizure violated his right to be secure against unreasonable searches and that their use as evidence compelled him to be a witness against himself in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and in violation of similar provisions of \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n the state Constitution. The Court of Appeals (People v. Adams, 176 N. Y. 351, 68 N. E. 636, 63 L. R. A. 406, 98 Am. St. Rep. 675) held that the provisions of the federal Constitution did not apply; that the use of the private papers as evidence did not violate the state Consitution; declared that it expressed no opinion as to the seizure, and applied the rule that a court, when engaged in trying a criminal case, will not take notice of the manner in which the witnesses obtained papers offered in evidence. And this court, assuming, without deciding, that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were applicable, held the use of the private papers as evidence did not violate any right safeguarded by these amendments, and, after reference to the procedure at the trial, declared that 'courts do not stop to inquire as to the means by which the evidence was obtained.' The court did not decide whether the seizure violated the Fourth Amendment. It decided that the admission in evidence of the private papers did not infringe the Fourth or Fifth Amendments. The case does not support the government's contention. And see Weeks v. United States, supra, 394-396 ( 34 S. Ct. 341); Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S. Ct. 182, 24 A. L. R. 1426; Agnello v. United States, supra, 34 (46 S. Ct. 4). And it is clear that the seizure of the ledger and bills, in the case now under consideration, was not authorized by the warrant. Cf. Kirvin v. United States (C. C. A.) 5 F. (2d) 282, 285; United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F. (2d) 202; Steele v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 498\n, 45 S. Ct. 414.\n\n 2. \nWhen arrested, Birdsall was actually engaged in a conspiracy to maintain, and was actually in charge of, the premises where intoxicating liquors were being unlawfully sold. Every such place is by the National Prohibition Act declared to be a common nuisance the maintenance of which is punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. Section 21, tit. 2, Act of October 28, 1919, 41 Stat. 305, 314 (U. S. C. tit. 27,  33 (27 USCA  33 )). The officers were authorized to arrest for crime being committed in their presence, and \n\n[275 U.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n they lawfully arrested Birdsall. They had a right without a warrant contemporaneously to search the place in order to find and seize the things used to carry on the criminal enterprise. Agnello v. United States, supra, 30 (46 S. Ct. 4); Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 158\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790; Weeks v. United States, supra, 392 (34 S. Ct. 341). The closet in which liquor and the ledger were found was used as a part of the saloon. And, if the ledger was not as essential to the maintenance of the establishment as were bottles, liquors and glasses, it was none the less a part of the outfit or equipment actually used to commit the offense. And, while it was not on Birdsall's person at the time of his arrest, it was in his immediate possession and control. The authority of officers to search and seize the things by which the nuisance was being maintained extended to all parts of the premises used for the unlawful purpose. Cf. Sayers v. United States (C. C. A.) 2 F. (2d) 146; Kirvin v. United States, supra; United States v. Kirschenblatt, supra. The bills for gas, electric light, water, and telephone services disclosed items of expense; they were convenient, if not in fact necessary, for the keeping of the accounts; and, as they were so closely related to the business, it is not unreasonable to consider them as used to carry it on. It follows that the ledger and bills were lawfully seized as an incident of the arrest.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion for leave to file petition for rehearing denied 48 S.

Horace Andrews, of Cleveland, Ohio, Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, and S. M. Jett, of Akron, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 31(b), which was added to the Revenue Act of 1916 by the Revenue Act of 1917, October 3, 1917, c. 63, tit. 12. 40 Stat. 300, 338, provides that any 'distribution made to the shareholders ... in the year nineteen hundred and seventeen, or subsequent tax years, ... shall constitute a part of the annual income of the distributee for the year in which received,' but that it 'shall be deemed to have been made from the most recently accumulated profits or surplus ... and shall be taxed to the distributee at the rates prescribed by law for the years in which such profits ... were accumulated.' See Edwards v. Douglas, \n269 \nU.S. 204\n, 46 S. Ct. 85.\n Mason, a shareholder in the B. F. Goodrich Company, received during the year 1917, five dividends prior to July 3. Two of them had been declared in the year 1916; three in January, 1917. In his income tax return for 1917, he reported all these dividends as taxable at the 1916 rate, and paid on that basis. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the tax on all these dividends was payable at the 1917 rate, which was higher than that for 1916; and assessed the additional amount. \n\n[275 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n It was paid under protest. Then this suit was brought against the collector, in the federal court for Northern Ohio, to recover the amount exacted. The case was heard without a jury upon stipulated facts, which were adopted by the court as its findings. The District Court entered judgment for Mason for the full amount. 8 F.(2d) 56. Its judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Routzahn v. Mason, 13 F.(2d) 702. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 687\n, 47 S. Ct. 344.\n The government admits that no profits were earned in 1917 prior to the payment of the dividends here in question. Mason claims, as to two of the dividends, that the 1916 rate applied, because the dividends had been declared in that year; and, as to all the dividends, that the 1916 rate applied, since the corporation had not earned in 1917 any net profits prior to the dates of the several dividend payments, so that the most recently accumulated net profits were those earned in the year 1916, which were more than sufficient for this purpose.\n The District Court held that, despite the fact that the profits for 1917 were in excess of all dividends paid in that year, the distribution must be deemed to have been made out of profits accumulated in 1916, and entered judgment for the full amount. Thereafter, and before this case was heard in the Court of Appeals, Edwards v. Douglas was decided by this court. The Court of Appeals recognized that Edwards v. Douglas differed in its facts from the case at bar. But it concluded that, under the reasoning of the opinion in that case, the taxing year should be treated as a unit; and it believed that it was required to hold that, if the net profits of a whole year prove sufficient to meet all the dividends paid within it, these must be deemed to have been paid from such profits, even if it affirmatively appears that none had been earned before the date when the latest dividend was paid.\n The Solicitor General concedes that Edwards v. Douglas does not so decide; that the case is authority only for \n\n[275 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n the proposition that a pro rata share of the entire year's earnings may be treated as approximating the actual earnings for the fraction of the year prior to the payment of the dividend, in the absence of circumstances showing that there were no earnings actually accumulated during the fractional period; that the amount actually available for payment of dividends out of the current year's earnings prior to the date of payment may always be shown; that such had been the practice of the Treasury Department from the time the Revenue Act of 1917 took effect until the date of the Court of Appeals' decision; and that this rule was embodied in its regulations.\n We see no good reason for disturbing the long-settled practice of the Treasury Department. Its contemporary interpretation is consistent with the language of the act; and its practice was, in substance, embodied in the Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18,  201(e), 40 Stat. 1057, 1060 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 b). We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals placed an erroneous construction on  31(b).\n Since two of the dividends paid in 1917 were declared in 1916, it becomes necessary for us to consider whether these also are to be deemed distributions made in 1917, as it is only to such that the section applies. It declares that the dividend is income of the shareholders in the year in which it is 'received.' We think it clear that, for this purpose, the date of payment, not the date of the declaration of the dividend, is the date of distribution; and, as all the dividends here in question were paid in 1917, the provision as to the rate is applicable to all. As there were no earnings in 1917 prior to the dates of the payments, and as there were confessedly ample accumulated earnings of 1916 prior to the declaration of the several dividends, we have no occasion to consider other questions which were argued. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAUL v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 655\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 501, 502]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nathan April, of New York City, and Howard M. Long, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel of information for the forfeiture of the Underwriter, an American vessel enrolled and licensed for the coastwise trade. Five causes of forfeiture are set \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n forth. One is that, in violation of section 4377 of the Revised Statutes ( Comp. St.  8132), the vessel was employed in a trade other than that for which she was licensed. Another is that, in violation of section 4337 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  8086), the vessel proceeded from the United States on a foreign voyage without giving up her enrollment and license and without being duly registered. The others are not now insisted on.\n In December, 1924, officers of the Coast Guard seized the vessel on the high seas, 34 miles from the coast, and turned her over to the collector of customs at New London, Conn., whereupon the libel was filed and the vessel arrested.\n The case was heard on an agreed statement of facts and an exception by the claimant, Maul, to the court's jurisdiction. The exception was sustained, on the theory that the officers of the Coast Guard were without authority to seize the vessel at sea more than 12 miles from the coast, and a decree dismissing the libel was entered. The Underwriter (D. C.) 6 F.( 2d) 937. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the exception untenable, sustained the two causes of forfeiture before stated, and accordingly reversed the decree. 13 F.(2d) 433. The claimant petitioned for a review by this court on certiorari, and the petition was granted.\n The claimant does not question here that the agreed facts establish the two causes of forfeiture, but does insist that the seizure was made without authority, and particularly that officers of the Coast Guard were not authorized to make such a seizure on the high seas more than 12 miles from the coast. The question has several phases which will be considered.\n It is well to bear in mind that the case neither involves the seizure of a foreign vessel, nor an exercise of asserted authority to board and search a vessel, domestic or foreign, for the purpose of detecting and thwarting in- \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n tended smuggling. The seizure was of an American vessel, then on the high seas and more than 12 Miles from the coast, which had become 'liable to seizure and forfeiture' by reason of definite and accomplished violations of the law under which she was enrolled and licensed.\n Section 45 of the Judicial Code declares:\n'Proceedings on seizures made on the high seas, for forfeiture under any law of the United States, may be prosecuted in any district into which the property so seized is brought and proceedings instituted.' Comp. St.  1027\n\n\n\n This provision originated with the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20,  9, 1 Stat. 73, has remained in force ever since (section 734, Rev. Stat.), and plainly recognizes that seizures for forfeitures may be made on the high seas. See The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391, 401, 402; The Abby, 1 Fed. Cas. 26, No. 14. True, it does not indicate how or by whom the seizures may be effected; but other provisions speak to the point. There is need to trace them from the beginning, and in doing so it should be in mind that officers of the Coast Guard are to be deemed customs officers, a matter which will be explained later on.\n The Act of July 31, 1789, c. 5, 1 Stat. 29, regulating the collection of duties on the tonnage of vessels and on the importation of merchandise, contained several provisions declaring that vessels violating its provisions should be liable to seizure and forfeiture, and also a section ( 26) authorizing customs officers 'to make seizure of and secure any ship or vessel, goods, or merchandise, which shall be liable to seizure by virtue of this act, as well without, as within their respective districts.' That act was repealed by the Act of August 4, 1790, c. 35, 1 Stat. 145, which enlarged the prior regulations and contained a section (50) giving customs officers the same authority to make seizures that was given \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n before. Next came the Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, 1 Stat. 627, which again enlarged the regulations and contained a section (70) respecting seizures which was like that in the prior acts. This last provision is now section 3072 of the Revised Statutes and reads as follows:\n'It shall be the duty of the several officers of the customs to seize and secure any vessel or merchandise which shall become liable to seizure by virtue of any law respecting the revenue, as well without as within their respective districts.' Comp. St.  5775.\n\n Along with the provision thus carefully preserved, the several acts contained other provisions distinct from it which authorized customs officers to board and search vessels bound to the United States and to inspect their manifests, examine their cargoes, and prevent any unlading while they were coming in. A supplemental Act of July 18, 1866, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178, enlarged that provision by declaring that, if it appeared to the officer making the search that there had been a violation of the laws of the United States whereby the vessel or any merchandise thereon was liable to forfeiture, he should make seizure of the same. The provision so enlarged became section 3059 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5761). In the early acts the authority to board and search was limited, not only to vessels bound to the United States, but to such as were within the territorial waters of the United States or within 4 leagues (12 miles) of the coast. But in the act of 1866 and in section 3059 of the Revised Statutes the words expressing these restrictions were omitted. Possibly the omission was not significant, for the same restrictions were expressed in section 3067 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5770), which related to the boarding and searching of vessels.\n The Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 979, 989, repealed sections 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes, and enacted a provision dealing with the same subject and reading as follows:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 581. Boarding Vessels. Officers of the customs or of the Coast Guard, and agents or other persons authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, or appointed for that purpose in writing by a collector may at any time go on board of any vessel or vehicle at any place in the United States or within four leagues of the coast of the United States, without as well as within their respective districts, to examine the manifest and to inspect, search, and examine the vessel or vehicle, and every part thereof, and any person, trunk, or package on board, and to this end to hail and stop such vessel or vehicle, if under way, and use all necessary force to compel compliance, and if it shall appear that any breach or violation of the laws of the United States has been committed, whereby or in consequence of which such vessel or vehicle, or the merchandise, or any part thereof, on board of or imported by such vessel or vehicle is liable to forfeiture, it shall be the duty of such officer to make seizure of the same, and to arrest, or, in case of escape or attempted escape, to pursue and arrest any person engaged in such breach or violation.\n'Officers of the Department of Commerce and other persons authorized by such department may go on board of any vessel at any place in the United States or within four leagues of the coast of the United States and hail, stop, and board such vessels in the enforcement of the navigation laws and arrest or, in the case of escape or attempted escape, pursue and arrest any person engaged in the breach or violation of the navigation laws.' Comp. St.  5841h.\n\n The last paragraph of this provision relates to the apprehension and arrest of individuals violating the navigation laws, not to the seizure of vessels; and neither party bases any contention or argument on it. So it may be passed as without bearing here.\n But the claimant contends, and the District Court ruled, that the first paragraph is now the sole source and meas- \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 507]\n\u00a0\n ure of the authority of Coast Guard officers to seize vessels, and that, as it provides only for seizure within the United States or within 12 miles of the coast, a seizure outside these limits is unlawful. The contention is faulty in that it puts aside section 3072 of the Revised Statutes, before quoted, which authorizes customs officers to seize any vessel 'liable to seizure by virtue of any law respecting the revenue' and declares, without limiting words, that this authority may be exercised 'as well without as within their respective districts.'\n Without doubt the provision in the act of 1922 is intended to take the place of sections 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes. It deals with the same subject and is accompanied by an express repeal of those sections. But it is not accompanied by a repeal of section 3072, and there is otherwise no reason for thinking it is intended to repeal or disturb that section. While the new provision and section 3072 are closely related, and both are directed to the protection of the revenue, they are distinct, free from real repugnance, and well may stand together. One provides primarily for boarding and searching vessels, within prescribed limits, to discover and prevent intended smuggling, and secondarily for the prompt seizure of the vessel by the searching officer if the search discloses a violation of law which subjects her to forfeiture. The other provides broadly, and without restriction as to place, for the seizure of vessels which, through violation of the laws respecting the revenue, have become liable to seizure. While the former restricts the authority to board and search to particular limits-the territorial waters and the high seas 12 miles outward from the coast-it does not purport to lay such a restriction on seizures. Where the seizure is incidental to a boarding and search under that provision the presence of the vessel within the prescribed limits operates to fix the place of seizure. Possibly the restriction may be said to affect such a seizure, but only \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n in a limited sense. In other seizures, of which there are many, the restriction has no bearing and no effect. So no reason appears for thinking Congress clearly intended to displace the general and long continued provision in section 3072. In this situation effect should be given to the familiar rule that in construing altered revenue laws 'the whole system must be regarded in each alteration, and no disturbance allowed of existing legislative rules of general application beyond the clear intention of Congress.' Saxonville Mills v. Russell, \n116 \nU.S. 13, 21\n, 6 S. Ct. 237, 240 (29 L. Ed. 554); Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 363; United States v. Sixty-Seven Packages of Dry Goods, 17 How. 85, 93.\n Thus far it has been assumed that the seizure came within the terms of section 3072; but questions are suggested in this connection which will be noticed.\n One question is whether the vessel's liability to seizure was 'by virtue of any law respecting the revenue.' The liability arose from a violation of sections 4337 and 4377 of the Revised Statutes-in that the vessel, being enrolled and licensed for the coastwise trade, proceeded on a foreign voyage without giving up her enrollment and license and without being duly registered, 1 and was employed in a trade other than that for which she was licensed. The sections violated are found in a subdivision of the Revised Statutes entitled 'Regulation of Vessels in Domestic Commerce,' but the arrangement of sections in the revision is without special significance. Rev. Stat.  5600 (Comp. St.  10597). That subdivision includes several provisions designed to regulate commerce by vessels and also to protect te revenue, these being related subjects. A reading of the sections violated in connection with others in the same sub- \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n division2 makes it plain that they are directed to the protection of the revenue; and therefore they come within the terms of section 3072. That they are also regulations of commerce by vessels does not make them any the less laws respection the revenue.\n Another question is whether officers of the Coast Guard are among those whom the section authorizes to make seizures. It says 'officers of the customs' and speaks of 'their respective districts.'\n By the act of 1790 (sections 62-64) Congress established the Revenue Cutter Service for the express purpose of protecting the revenue, directed that its expenses be paid out of duties collected on imported merchandise and on the tonnage of vessels, and declared that its officers should 'be deemed officers of the customs.' By the act of 1799 (sections 97-102) these provisions were enlarged and re-enacted, collectors of customs were given a power of direction over the service subject to assignments and wide supervision by the Secretary of the Treasury, and officers of the service were given authority to hail 'vessels liable to seizure or examination' and to enforce submission. The enlarged provisions were included in the Revised Statutes (sections 2747-2765) and are still in force, save that in 1915 the Coast Guard became the successor of the Revenue Cutter Service and took over its personnel, vessels, duties and powers. 38 Stat. 800, c. 20 (Comp. St.  8459 1\/2 a(1)-(6).\n The regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time show that it early became the practice to assign vessels and officers in this service to particular customs districts and to subject their activities largely to the direction of the collectors of customs. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n And it otherwise appears that this practice became so settled that the vessels and officers when assigned were regarded as 'belonging' to the particular districts. The Eliza, 8 Fed. Cas. 445, No. 4,346; The Friendship, 9 Fed. Cas. 822, No. 5,124.\n In recent years the number of vessels and the personnel have been enlarged and provision has been made for imposing additional duties not requiring special notice here. The practice of assigning vessels and their officers to particular customs districts also has been changed to the extent that now the assignments are of one or more vessels to coast divisions, including one or more customs districts. \n4\n Otherwise the duties and practice in respect of the protection of the revenue remain practically as before. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n It is apparent from this review of the statutes and regulations that Coast Guard officers are to be deemed officers of the customs within the meaning of section 3072, and also that their connection with particular customs districts-whether one or more-is such that they properly may be said to have districts in the sense intended by the term 'their respective districts.' The term is not peculiar to section 3072. It was applied to Revenue Cutter officers in section 31 of the act of 1790, section 54 of the act of 1799, and sections 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes, and is now applied to Coast Guard officers in section 581 of the act of 1922.\n The remaining question relates to the meaning of the clause indicating where the officers may seize. It says 'as well without as within their respective districts.' Two constructions are suggested-one restricting the natural sense and treating the clause as if saying 'as well within other customs districts as within their own,' and the other accepting the natural sense. The difference \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 511]\n\u00a0\n is that one excludes and the other includes the sea outside customs districts. In actual practice the latter construction has been adopted and it appears to be right. Besides giving effect to the natural import of the clause, it is better adapted to the attainment of the purpose of the section. If vessels violating the revenue laws and thereby incurring liability to forfeiture could escape seizure by departing from or avoiding waters within customs districts the liability to forfeiture would be of little practical effect in checking violations; and it is most improbable that Congress intended to leave the avenues of escape thus unguarded. The terms it has used are easily broad enough to meet the situation effectively (United States v. Bowman, \n260 U.S. 94\n, 98-100, 43 S. Ct. 39), and no reason is suggested or perceived for cutting them down as respects domestic vessels. If Congress were without power to provide for the seizure of such vessels on the high sea, a restrictive construction might be justified. But there is no want of power in this regard. The high sea is common to all nations and foreign to none; and every nation having vessels there has power to regulate them and also to seize them for a violation of its laws. The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362, 371; Wilson v. McNamee, \n102 U.S. 572\n, 574; Lord v. Steamship Co., \n102 U.S. 541\n, 544; The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 403\n, 28 S. Ct. 133; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 355\n, 29 S. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100, 123\n, 129 S., 43 S. Ct. 504, 27 A. L. R. 1306; 3 Ops. Attys. Gen. 405; 1 Kent's Com. 26; Hall's International Law (7th Ed.)  77; 1 Hyde, International Law,  227.\n Some distinctions have been recognized in respect of seizing domestic vessels when in foreign waters and of seizing foreign vessels on the high sea (Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, supra, 123, 124 (43 S. Ct. 504); The Appollon, supra, 370, 371; Church v. Hubbart, 2 Cranch, 187, 234, 235; The Mariana Flora, 11 Wheat. 1, 42; Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240, 258\n, 11 S. Ct. 559; 1 Hyde, International Law,  236; West \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 512]\n\u00a0\n lake, International Law, p. 177); but the extent and application of these distinctions are not involved in this case.\n It follows that the seizure in this instance by the officers of the Coast Guard was lawful and therefore that the exception to the District Court's jurisdiction was ill grounded. Whether if the seizure-made by federal officers-were unlawful the ruling in Dodge v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 530\n, 47 S. Ct. 191, would apply need not be considered.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring).\n I concur in the judgment of the court; but I cannot agree to the construction of the statutes on which the decision is rested. The court holds that the statutes confer upon the Coast Guard express authority to seize on the high seas beyond the 12-mile limit an American vessel which has become liable to forfeiture for violation of the navigation laws, and the reason assigned is that these are 'laws respecting the revenue' within the meaning of section 3072 of the Revised Statutes. As I read the statutes, they do not confer express authority, but the authority exists because it is to be implied as an incident of the police duties of ocean patrol which Congress has imposed upon the Coast Guard. Mere difference of opinion in the construction of intricate statutes can rarely justify expression of dissent. This is especially true where the two views lead, in the particular case, to the same result. But, in this instance the construction adopted by the court may have in other cases far-reaching and regrettable results.\n Enforcement of the 'laws respecting the revenue' form only a part of the ocean patrol duties imposed by Congress upon the Coast Guard; and seizure on the high seas of vessels which have 'become liable to seizure' does not exhaust the services requied of the Coast \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 513]\n\u00a0\n Guard to insure enforcement there of the laws respecting the revenue. Unless the Coast Guard has authority to seize the ship and to arrest persons thereon found violating our laws, no American official is authorized to do so. If the statutes are construed as granting to the Coast Guard express authority to make the seizure in question in order to protect the revenue, the authority so granted is obviously very narrow, and the express grant may possibly be read as exhausting he authority conferred beyond the 12-mile limit; in other words, as showing that no implied authority is conferred. For this reason it seems to me important to state why I cannot assent to the view expressed by the court.\n The claimant concedes that, within the United States, the Coast Guard is charged with the duty of enforcing our navigation laws, and for this purpose, may board, search, and seize American vessels there, that out navigation laws govern American merchant vessels on the high seas, and that the United States could by appropriate legislation authorize the Coast Guard to seize, without a warrant, any such vessel violating our law on the high seas, regardless of distance from our coast. See United States v. Bowman, \n260 \nU.S. 94, 97\n, 43 S. Ct. 39; Cunard Steamship Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100, 125\n, 129 S., 43 S. Ct. 504, 27 A. L. R. 1306. His contention apparently is that Congress does not impose upon officers of the Coast Guard any duty to enforce the navigation laws on the high seas beyond the 12-mile limit; and that, even if it does impose the duty, it has not conferred authority to enforce compliance by means of a seizure to be made there. The question for decision is the power of the Coast Guard to seize American vessels beyond the twelve-mile limit. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 501, 514]\n\u00a0\n The Coast Guard is a part of the civil establishment. It is a bureau of the Treasury Department,7 established by Act of January 28, 1915, c. 20, 38 Stat. 800 (Comp. St.  8459 1\/2 a(1)-(6)) in lieu of the existing Revenue Cutter Service and Life Saving Service. These had theretofore been separate-the Revenue Cutter Service a division, the Life Saving Service a bureau, of the Treasury. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 374\n, 42 S. Ct. 337. The Revenue Cutter Service was established by Act of August 4, 1790, c. 35,  31, 62-65, 1 Stat. 145, 164, 175. That statute was superseded by the Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22 ,  54, 70, 97-102, 1 Stat. 627, 668, 678, 699, 700. The provisions of the act of 1799 concerning search and seizure specifically by revenue cutters were embodied without substantial change in Revised Statutes,  2760, 2761, 2763, 3067, 3069, 3070, and 3072 (Comp. St.  8459 1\/2 b (52 ), (53), (55), 5770, 5772, 5773, 5775). Their scope and purpose will be discussed later. They are now in full force, except so far as they were repealed by the Tariff Act of 1922 (Comp. St.  5841a et seq.) or may have been modified by section 581 thereof (Comp. St.  5841h). The \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 515]\n\u00a0\n act of 1915 did not add to or abridge in any respect existing duties and powers of officers of revenue cutters. It merely transferred to the Coast Guard the duties and powers theretofore possessed.\n When the Revenue Cutter Service was established, its duties were limited to the protection of the revenues. In 1793, the duty of enforcing also the navigation laws was imposed. \n8\n Thereafter, from time to time, the duty of enforcing many other laws relating to transactions involving marine operations were added. Revenue cutters became thus America's civil ocean patrol. \n9\n But their service is not limited to enforcing our municipal law. They have been employed also in protecting the lives and property of Americans against foreigners in international controversies falling short of war; and they have served during wars in operations against the enemy. 10 Revenue cutters are armed cruisers. Naval discipline, drill, and routine prevail on all the ships. Their officers are commissioned, and their men enlisted, like officers and men in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The Secretary of the Treasury assigns them to a particular vessel, and the vessel is usually assigned to a particular station. But he may make such transfer of an officer from one vessel to another, and of the vessel from one station to another, as he deems desirable. Both the Secretary of the Treasury and the President may direct any \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 516]\n\u00a0\n revenue cutter to cruise in any waters in order to perform any duty of the service. Wiley v. United States, 40 Ct. Cl. 406; Act of April 21, 1910, c. 182,  2, 36 Stat. 326 (Comp. St.  8459 1\/2 b(46)); Regulations of Coast Guard (1923), art. 101.\n With the enlargement of the revenue cutters' funcitons came necessarily an extension of the field of their operations. They range the seas coastwise or far into the ocean, as occasion and the particular duties demand The earlier regulations11 issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, included among the laws to be enforced, those prohibiting the slave trade,12 the laws to preserve neutrality,13 laws for the suppression of piracy,14 and the law to prevent the cutting and removing of timber from public lands 'for exportation to any foreign country.' \n15\n Among the duties recited in the later regulations16 are lending medical aid to vessels of the United States engaged in deep sea fisheries17; enforcing the sponge fishing law18; assisting vessels in distress upon the oceans19 and \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 517]\n\u00a0\n the Great Lakes20; removing derelicts21; suppressing mutinies22; patrolling the North Pacific and the Bering Sea for the purpose of enforcing the laws for the protection of the fur seal and sea otter23; and the service of ice observation and patrol, pursuant to the Convention of January 20, 1914, designed to promote safety of the North Atlantic, following the International Conference of November 12, 1913.24 By no act or regulation is the field of activity restricted to the 12-mile limit. Some of the duties imposed upon revenue cutters involve necessarily service hundreds of miles from any American coast. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 501, 518]\n\u00a0\n Forfeiture of the offending vessel is a punishment commonly prescribed for violation of our navigation laws, and of many other laws which revenue cutters are required to aid in enforcing. Of these there are many which are in no way concerned with the collection of the revenue. \n26\n In order to enforce these laws adequately, it is necessary that some officials of the government shall \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 519]\n\u00a0\n have authority to seize American vessels which are found violating them. Many of the offenses are of such a character that they can be committed anywhere on the high seas. The challenge of the authority of the Coast Guard \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 520]\n\u00a0\n to make a seizure beyond the 12-mile limit presents, therefore, questions affecting the enforcement not only of the navigation laws, but also of the customs laws, the National Prohibition Law (Comp. St.  10138 1\/4 et seq.), and others. If the officers of revenue cutters were without authority to seize American merchant vessels found violating our laws on the high seas beyond the 12-mile limit, or to seize such vessels found there which are known theretofore to have violated our laws without or within those limits, many offenses against our laws might, to that extent, be committed with impunity; for clearly no other arm of the government possesses such authority.\n The questions presented necessitate enquiry into early and recent administrative practice, as well as into legislation and judicial decisions. I shall consider first whether officers of revenue cutters had authority to seize on the high seas for violation of the navigation laws prior to \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 521]\n\u00a0\n the Tariff Act of 1922 (42 Stat. 858); then, whether that act abridged their authority.\n First. The provisions of the navigation laws alleged to have been violated, have been in force since the beginning of our government. Act Feb. 18, 1793, c. 8,  8, 32 (1 Stat. 305, 308, 316); Rev. Stat.  4337, 4377 (Comp. St.  8086, 8132). The express authority to board and search in terms beyond the territorial limits of the United States appeared first in sections 31 and 64 of the Customs Collection Act of August 4, 1790, c. 35 (1 Stat. 145, 164, 175), which established the Revenue Cutter Service. The authority there confered upon it was to board and search within 'the United States, or within four leagues (twelve miles) of the coast.' It applied to all vessels, foreign as well as American; but was limited to inbound vessels. These sections, which granted power to board and search, contained no express grant of power to seize. Express statutory authority to seize in terms beyond the territorial limits of the United States for violation of its laws was not conferred, until the Tariff Act of 1922, in respect to any offence except in those few instances in which Congress, in pursuance of specific treaties, provided that any vessel, foreign or American, might be seized. \n27\n We are concerned here only with the right of the Coast Guard to seize an American vessel for violation of a law applicable solely to such vessels.\n The only express statutory authorization upon which, prior to the Tariff Act of 1922, a claim of power in any official to seize a vessel on any waters for violation of the navigation laws could possibly be predicated were section 27 of the Act of February 18, 1793, c. 8, 1 Stat. 305, 315 (a navigation law), which was repealed by its ommission from \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 522]\n\u00a0\n the Revised Statutes;28 and section 2 of the Act of July 18, 1866, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178 (a customs collection law), which was embodied in section 3059 of the Revised Statutes as a part of 'Title XXXIV, Collection of Duties upon Imports' (Comp. St.  5761); and section 3072 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5775), which dealt with seizures for violation of 'any law respecting the revenue.' \n29\n Section 3059 authorized 'any officer of the customs, including' those 'of a revenue cutter,' to 'go on board of any vessel ... to inspect, search, and examine the same; ... and if it shall appear that any breach or violation of the laws of the United States has been committed, whereby ... such vessel ... is liable to forfeiture, to make seizure of the same. ...'\n The authority which sections 3059, 3072, and the earlier acts, expressly conferred upon all officers 'of the customs' was to seize 'as well without as within his district.' No distinction was there made between foreign and domestic vessels; nor between inbound and outbound vessels. The clause appeared first in the Act of July 31, 1789, c. 5,  26 ( 1 Stat. 29, 43), the earliest law regulating the collection of customs. As there used, the clause clearly meant only that collectors, naval officers and surveyors should have the authority to seize in other districts of the United States besides the particular ones to which \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 523]\n\u00a0\n they were respectively appointed. For the clause antedated the first express authorization of either search or seizure without the territorial limits of the United States; and antedated also the establishment of the Revenue Cutter Service. \n30\n Did the phrase 'without ... his district,' when used in section 3059, continue to mean within some other customs collection district of the United States, or did it acquire the new meaning of anywhere, even without the territorial waters of the United States? Compare Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 205.\n If the former meaning is the true one, there was prior to the Tariff Act of 1922 no express authority in officers of revenue cutters to seize for violation of any law beyond the territorial limits of the United States. If the latter meaning is the true one, not only officers of revenue cutters, but also all other customs officers were given by section 3059 express authority to seize anywhere on the high seas any vessel, foreign or American, found violating our laws. In my opinion the former meaning is clearly the true one. Congress cannot have intended to confer the general authority to seize foreign vessels upon the high seas. \n31\n And the clause in question is used in section 581 of the act of 1922 (Comp. St .  5841h) in the same sentence with an express territorial limitation. But it does not follow that American vessels violating our laws beyond the territoral limits could not be seized. Authority to seize American vessels \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 524]\n\u00a0\n there was conferred upon officers of revenue cutters by implication. They possessed the authority as an incident of their office of ocean patrol. They are officers of the branch of the government charged with the faithful execution of the laws. Wherever on the high seas they were charged with enforcing compliance with our laws, there they were, in my opinion, authorized to seize American vessels, regardless of the distance from our coast. \n32\n Compare United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 15; United States v. Tingey, 5 Pet . 115, 126; 28 Op. Attys. Gen. 121, 124, 549, 552.\n There is no limitation upon the right of the sovereign to seize without a warrant vessels registered under its laws, similar to that imposed by the common law and the Constitution upon the arrest of persons and upon the seizure of 'papers and effects.' \n33\n See Carroll v. United \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 525]\n\u00a0\n States, \n267 U.S. 132\n, 151-153, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790. Smuggling is commonly attended by violation of the navigation laws. From the beginning of our government officers of revenue cutters have, for the purpose of enforcing the customs laws, been expressly authorized to board and search inbound vessels on the high seas within twelve miles of our coast. It is not to be lightly assumed that Congress intended to deny to revenue cutters so engaged authority to seize American vessels found to be violating our navigation laws. Nor is it lightly to be assumed that Congress intended to deny to officers of revenue cutters engaged in enforcing other laws of the United States beyond the 12-mile limit, the authority to seize American vessels found to be violating our navigation laws beyond those limits.\n From the beginning of our government, it has been the practice of revenue cutters to make such seizures. The official records and judicial decisions show that revenue cutters were employed early in our history, and that they have been employed continuously since, in enforcing our navigation laws upon the high seas regardless of distance from the coast; and that, whether operating within the United States or without, they have, rgardless of distance from the coast, seized American vessels found violating our laws, without regard to whether the laws violated related to the revenue. \n34\n Congress has by its ac- \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 526]\n\u00a0\n tion sanctioned this exertion of power. It supported the activities of the service by ever increasing appropriations. \n35\n It equipped the Coast Guard, before the Tariff Act of 1922, with the able cruising cutters, many of which were engaged largely in patrol beyond the 12-mile limit. To seize anywhere on the high seas American ves- \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 527]\n\u00a0\n sels found violating our laws was thus, I think, within the implied authority of its officers before the act of 1922. It remains to consider whether that act abridged the authority theretofore possessed.\n Second. The Tariff Act of 1922 includes as title 4 a revision of the customs administrative provisions then in force. 42 Stat. 858, 948, et seq . (Comp. St.  5841d et seq.). In section 642 (Comp. St.  5841i1) it recites the provisions of the earlier law which the Act repealed. Among these are sections 3059 and 3067 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5761, 5770). The former is the section which conferred upon officers of the customs express power to seize 'within or without his district.' The latter is the section which conferred upon them authority to board and search inbound vessels within twelve miles of our coast. The sections parallel to section 3067, relating specifically to officers of revenue cutters, first found in section 64 of the act of 1790 (1 Stat. 175), re- enacted as section 99 of the act of 1799 (1 Stat. 700), and again as sections 2760-2762 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  8459 1\/2 b52-8459 1\/2 b54), were neither repeated nor repealed by the act of 1922. Nor did it repeat or repeal section 3072 (Comp. St.  5775). For the provisions repealed it substituted section 581 (Comp. St.  5841h), which, so far as material, is as follows:36 \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 528]\n\u00a0\n 'Boarding Vessels.-Officers of the customs or of the Coast Guard, and agents or other persons authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, or appointed for that purpose in writing by a collector may at any time go on board of any vessel or vehicle at any place in the United States or within four leagues of the coast of the United States, without as well as within their respective districts, to examine the manifest and to inspect, search, and examine the vessel or vehicle, and every part thereof, and any person, truck, or package on board, and to this end to hail and stop such vessel or vehicle, if under way, and use all necessary force to compel compliance, and if it shall appear that any breach or violation of the laws of the United States has been committed, whereby or in consequence of which such vessel or vehicle, or the merchandise, or any part thereof, on board of or imported by such vessel or vehicle is liable to forfeiture, it shall be the duty of such officer to make seizure of the same, and to arrest, or, in case of escape or attempted escape, to pursue and arrest any person engaged in such breach or violation.'\n The provision quoted above was adopted by Congress without substantial change from the draft of a bill contained in the report 'Upon the revision of the Customs Administrative Laws' made by the United States Tariff Commission to the Committee on Ways and Means in 1918, and resubmitted in 1921. Whether intentionally or not, the paragraph of section 581 quoted above introduced \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 529]\n\u00a0\n two changes into the statutory law. Unlike the earlier statutes, it did not limit to inbound vessels the right to board and search. And, unlike the earlier statutes, it apparently conferred (through the inclusion of the grant of authority to seize in the same paragraph with the grant of authority to board or search) upon all customs officers the right to seize any vessel on any waters within the 12-mile limit. \n37\n The reports of the commission and those of the committees of Congress discuss many proposed changes in the customs administrative laws. But nowhere in the reports of the commission or of Congress, or in the statute enacted, is there a suggestion of purpose to abridge by this provision the authority theretofore possessed by the Coast Guard to make seizure on the high seas. It seems clear that Congress did not by this revision intend that the power to seize on the high seas for violation of laws respecting the revenue should remain, but that the similar power to seize for violation of other laws should be taken away.\n Since, in my opinion, R. S.  3059, had not conferred any express power to seize beyond territorial waters, I do not think its repeal shows any intention to take away the then existing implied power of the Coast Guard to seize American vessels anywhere on the high seas, for violation of any law of the United States. There is no foundation for the assumption of the claimant that the first paragraph of section 581 was intended as the exclusive grant of the power to seize. The primary purpose of that paragraph was not to provide for the seizure of American vessels of known or suspected guilt. It was to facilitate, by means of boarding and examination of manifest before arrival in port, both the entry of admittedly innocent vessels and the collection of revenues. This end was furthered by enabling customs officers to board and search any vessel, foreign or domestic, within \n\n[274 U.S. 501, 530]\n\u00a0\n the stated limits, without the necessity of establishing probable cause. The authority to board and search foreign vessels beyond the territorial limits would doubtless not have been implied as a mere incident of the customs officers' duties, and it is probable that the authority to board and search American vessels in the absence of probable cause was not regarded as clear.\n Other action of Congress taken at about the same time shows that Congress had no purpose to abridge the Coast Guard's activities or powers. The appropriation acts make provision for large increases in equipment and personnel to enable it to combat the increased smuggling operations following upon the enactment of the National Prohibition Law. Moreover, conventions were negotiated with Great Britain and other foreign nations to secure permission to seize their vessels on the high seas if found engaged in smuggling operations. 38 Neither in the negotiations nor in the conventions was any reference made to a 12-mile limit. The limitation agreed upon was an hour's run from our coast. The distance covered by the hour's run would often greatly exceed twelve miles from our coast. But Congress did not deem it necessary to enact supplementary legislation in order to make the conventions effective. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 501, 531]\n\u00a0\n In my opinion, then, the Coast Guard is authorized to arrest American vessels subject to forfeiture under our law, no matter what the place of seizure and no matter what the law violated.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The distinction between being enrolled and licensed and being registered is that the former is a condition to employment in the coastwise trade while the latter pertains to foreign trade. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rev.

The right of the sovereign to seize a vessel for violation of the municipal law, is in some respects analogous to the right of a belligerent, recognized by the international law, to seize contraband.

Cas. 832, No. 15,551. \n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] In most cases, the cutters merely report violations of law, without making seizures. The reports do show, however, that when it was thought necessary to arrest American vessels, the seizures were made without regard to location. See The Elizabeth, 8 Fed.

Thus, in regard to specific American vessels, the commandant's office frequently sends out confidential orders to 'seize whenever and wherever found,' or to 'board and search whenever and wherever found.'\n The files of the Coast Guard show that from September 1, 1922, to February 10, 1927, at least 75 American vessels were seized beyond the 12- mile limit, for violations of the Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/4 et seq.) alone; of these seizures at least 21 were made more than 30 miles from the coast. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] After the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment Congress made each year a large increase in the appropriation for the Coast Guard, and provided for the acquisition of additional vessels of the cruiser type. Before the passage of the Tariff Act of 1922 the year's appropriations had been increased to $9,800,000 and the acquisition or construction of additional cruising vessels had been authorized. On April 2, 1924, a special appropriation of $12,194,900 was made for construction of additional ocean-going vessels and for reconditioning and equipping those vessels which it authorized the Navy to transfer to the Coast Guard. The appropriation for maintenance increased to $20,800,000 by 1926.\n In 1919, the aggregate of vessels boarded was 2,005; in 1922, 31,653; in 1925, 53,080. The number of vessels seized or reported for violations of law increased from 601 in 1919 to 1,887 in 1925. It should be noted that comparatively few of the penalties for minor infractions of the law are collected. By the Act of February 14, 1903, c. 552,  10 (32 Stat. 825, 829 (Comp. St.  859)), the power to remit penalties and forfeitures for violation of laws 'relating to merchant vessels,' theretofore in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury, was given to the Secretary of Commerce. This power has been liberally exercised. See, e. g., 1913 Annual Report of Commissioner of Navigation, p. 23. \n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] The second paragraph of section 581 (42 Stat. 979), relates solely to officers of vessels of the Department of Commerce. It is as follows:\n'Officers of the Department of Commerce and other persons authorized by such department may go on board of any vessel at any place in the United States or within four leagues of the coast of the United States and hail, stop, and board such vessels in the enforcement of the navigation laws and arrest or, in case of escape or attempted escape, pursue and arrest any person engaged in the breach or violation of the navigation laws.'\n\n Prior to 1903, the Secretary of the Treasury was charged with both the administration and the enforcement of the navigation laws. The administration was committed in part to the collectors of the ports, in part to the Bureau of Navigation. The enforcement was committed in part to the collectors, in part to the Revenue Cutter Service. In that year Congress created the Department of Commerce and Labor and transferred to it the Bureau of Navigation. Act Feb. 14, 1903, c. 552 (32 Stat. 825). In 1913 that bureau became a part of the new Department of Commerce. Act March 4, 1913, c. 141 (37 Stat. 736). Thereby certain duties in respect to the administration of the navigation laws passed to the Department of Commerce. To enable it to take some part also in the enforcement of the navigation laws Congress provided it with a few cutters. See Annual Report of Commissioner of Navigation 1915, pp. 31, 32. The above paragraph was inserted at the instance of the Department of Commerce when the Customs Administration Law was in the conference committee.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] See note 31, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] At least nine such treaties have been proclaimed.

MCNEELY(1927)\nNo. 140\nArgued: Decided: June 6, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hugh Tullis, of Vidalia, La., L. T. Kennedy, of Natchez, Miss., and W. H. Watkins, of Jackson, Miss., for McNeely's administratrix. \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 677]\n\u00a0\n Mr. G. P. Bullis, of Vidalia, La., for town of Vidalia.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to restrain the town of Vidalia, La., from unwarrantably interfering with the operation by the complainant of a public ferry from that town across the Mississippi river to Natchez, Miss. On a preliminary hearing the District Court awarded the complainant a temporary injunction. 6 F.(2d) 19. In the answer the defendant insisted that the complainant was without a license from it to operate the ferry, and on that ground prayed that he be enjoined from continuing his operation. On the final hearing the temporary injunction was made permanent, with a modification which will be noticed later, and the injunction prayed by the defendant was denied. 6 F.(2d) 21. The parties then were allowed cross-appeals to this court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), as it stood at that time. The complainant died shortly thereafter, and his administratrix was substituted as a party in his stead, but for convenience we shall state the case and discuss it as if he were still living. The material facts will be stated.\n The complainant, McNeely, is a citizen and resident of Mississippi, and for more than 20 years has been operating a public ferry from Vidalia across the Mississippi river to Natchez and from Natchez to Vidalia. He has three boats in the service, and has floating steel docks and other equipment at both Vidalia and Natchez, which he uses in making landings and in receiving and discharging passengers and freight. The value of the boats and equipment is $50,000 or more, and the yearly income from \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 678]\n\u00a0\n the ferry is about $5,000. At Vidalia his floating docks and landing equipment have been moored and maintained at and near the foot of Concordia street, which was designated by the town as the landing place for his ferry when he began operating it. The variation in the rise and fall of the river is about 55 feet, and a levee extends along the bank and across Concordia street. So it has been essential for him to construct and maintain a ramp or graduated approach from his docks to the intersection of the street and levee. While operating the ferry, he acquired ans still holds the lots abutting on the river for several hundred feet on either side of Concordia street. Occasionally he has moved his docks street. landing facilities to one side of the street or the other, but only in front of his own lots. His boats have been duly inspected, enrolled, and licensed under the navigation laws of the United States, and are manned and operated conformably to the requirements of those laws; but he now has no local license to operate the ferry.\n The suit was begun in October, 1924. Theretofore the complainant had been operating the ferry under licenses granted by Vidalia and Natchez, but these licenses had then terminated. Early in 1924 the town of Vidalia adopted an ordinance specially granting to the city of Natchez and its assigns a license to operate a public ferry from Vidalia to Natchez and return for a period of 10 years, on stated terms whereby the licensee was to have the use of all streets and public places on the river side of the levee at Vidalia for a landing place and approaches, was to pay to Vidalia $ 1,000 per year during the life of the license, and was to have a preference right to receive, without further payment, any license which Vidalia might conclude to give for another ferry to Natchez.\n The license so granted to the city of Natchez was transferred by it to the Royal Route Company, a corporation. Vidalia recognized the transfer and then adopted a fur- \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 679]\n\u00a0\n ther ordinance designating for such assignee the same landing place at the foot of Concordia street which it theretofore had designated for the complainant and which he was still using. This ordinance forbade any one other than such assignee to moor, tie, anchor, or keep any craft or object of any kind in the river within 150 feet of that landing place, imposed a substantial penalty for every violation of that provision, and directed the mayor and marshal of the town to remove immediately any offending craft or object found within such limits. No provision of any kind was made for another landing place for the complainant, or for the further operation of his ferry, or for the operation of any ferry other than that of such assignee.\n The complainant, believing that Vidalia had exceeded its power in the premises, continued to operate his ferry, whereupon the town proceeded to arrest and punish him under the provisions just described. He then brought this suit, charging in the complaint that the ordinances and action of the town constituted such an interference with interstate commerce as is forbidden to a state and its agencies by the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. The District Court, while recognizing that, in the absence of controlling congressional legislation, the town possesses a substantial power of regulation in respect of the operation of such a ferry, was of opinion that its action in this instance was in excess of its power, and therefore that the complainant was entitled to an injunction. It was also of opinion that the river bank from the levee to the water, although belonging to the owner of the adjacent land, is under the law of the state subject to a servitude permitting its use for various public purposes including that of using it as a place of landing for ferry boats and for receiving and discharging passengers and freight carried thereon, and that, while the designation of landing places as between competing \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 680]\n\u00a0\n ferries is a matter ordinarily resting with local municipal authorities, Vidalia's discriminatory action towards the complainant had been such as to justify the court in making the designation. It accordingly designated for the Royal Route Company 300 feet of the bank and water frontage beginning 10 feet north of the north line of Concordia street and extending thence upstream, and confined the complainant to the portion beginning 10 feet south of the south line of the street and extending thence downstream.\n The town renews the contention, made below, that, consistently with the commerce clause, it may grant or withhold a license to operate such a ferry, guided only by its judgment of what is in keeping with the public interest, and may prohibit the operation of such a ferry without a license from it. The argument advanced in support of the contention is that, if local authorities may not control ferriage over boundary streams like the Mississippi by granting or withholding licenses, the ferriage, will be subject to no restrictions, and the public may suffer from extortionate rates and an absence of provisions for safe carriage, because the nature of the business and varying local conditions make it impracticable for Congress to prescribe effective general regulations. We think the argument confuses power to license, and therefore to exclude from the business, with power to regulate it, and also that the contention is unsound.\n The transportation persons and property from one state to another is none the less interstate commerce because conducted by ferry, and it does not admit of question that ferries so employed are subject to congressional regulation. Congress has adopted some measures to promote the safety of this form of transportation (Rev. Stat.  4233, rule 7, and section 4426 (Comp. St.  7949, 8187)), and also a measure regulating rates on ferries operated in connection with railroads \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 681]\n\u00a0\n (New York Central R. R. Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County, \n227 \nU.S. 248, 263\n, 33 S. Ct. 269).\n But, while holding that such interstate transporation is subject to congressional regulation, this court always has recognized that ferries operated across boundary waters between states simply as a means of transit from shore to shore should be deemed instruments of local convenience, and subject to local regulation, to the extent that, in the absence of congressional action, each state may act with respect to the ferriage from its shore. In Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 206\n, 5 S. Ct. 826, where particular state action in respect of an interstate ferry was condemned as placing an inadmissible burden on interstate commerce, there was express recognition of the authority of the state to prescribe 'such measures as will prevent confusion among the vessels, and collision between them, insure their safety and convenience, and facilitate the discharge or receipt of their passengers and freight.' In Port Richmond & Bergen Point Ferry Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County, \n234 \nU.S. 317, 331\n, 34 S. Ct. 821, 826, which related to a ferry between two states, there was express affirmation of the authority of each state to fix reasonable rates for the ferriage from its shore. The court said in that connection:\n'It has never been supposed that, because of the absence of federal action, the public interest was unprotected from extortion, and that, in order to secure reasonable charges in a myriad of such different local instances, exhibiting an endless variety of circumstances, it would be necessary for Congress to act directly, or to establish for that purpose a federal agency. The matter is illuminated by the consideration of this alternative, for the point of the contention is that, there being no federal regulation, the ferry rates are to be deemed free from all control. The practical advantages of having the matter dealt with by the states are obvious, and are illustrated \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 682]\n\u00a0\n by the practice of 125 years. And in view of the character of the subject, we find no sound objection to its continuance. If Congress at any time undertakes to regulate such rates, its action will of course control.'\n\n But the court was careful to indicate that the decision was not intended to give any sanction to 'prohibitory or discriminatory requirements, or burdensome exactions,' interfering with 'the guaranteed freedom of interstate intercourse.'\n The case of City of Sault Ste. Marie v. International Transit Co., \n234 \nU.S. 333\n, 34 S. Ct. 826, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 574, is specially in point here. That was a suit by a Canadian corporation conducting a ferry between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontaria, and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to prevent the enforcement against it of an ordinance of the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., prohibiting the operation of a ferry from that city to the opposite shore of the St. Mary's river, except under a license from that city and on the payment of a license fee of $50. The ordinance was assailed as being in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution and with a treaty with Great Britain. The court sustained the constitutional objection and the plaintiff's right to an injunction, without considering the treaty question. It said:\n'The fundamental principle involved has been applied by this court in recent decisions in a great variety of circumstances, and it must be taken to be firmly established that one otherwise enjoying full capacity for the purpose cannot be compelled to take out a local license for the mere privilege of carrying on interstate or foreign commerce (citing cases).\n\n'Assuming that, by reason of the local considerations pertinent to the operation of ferries, there exists, in the absence of federal action, a local protective power to prevent extortion in the rates charged for ferriage from the shore of the state, and to prescribe reasonable regulations \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 683]\n\u00a0\n necessary to secure good order and convenience, we think that the action of the city in the present case in requiring the appellee to take out a license, and to pay a license fee, for the privilege of transacting the business conducted at its wharf, was beyond the power which the state could exercise either directly or by delegation.'\n\n The action of the town in this case is on the same plane. The complainant, according to the record, has full capacity to operate, and is operating, a serviceable ferry over the Mississippi and the town is attempting to exclude his ferry on the ground that he is operating it without a local license. The question is not whether the town may fix reasonable rates applicable to ferriage from its river front or may prescribe reasonable regulations calculated to secure safety and convenience in the conduct of the business, but whether it may make its consent and license a condition precedent to a right to en gage therein. This we hold it may not do.\n Both parties complain of the part of the decree designating the landing places to be used by the competing ferries-the town on the ground that it alone is clothed with authority to make such designations, and the complainant on the ground that the designation was made without proper regard for his ownership of the land or his prior use and improvements.\n It must be conceded that the designation of places for ferry landings along the river bank within the town limits is a function which primarily belongs to the town and is not ordinarily subject to judicial control. But here the town proceeded on the erroneous theory that the complainant's ferry need not be considered. Not only was no new landing place assigned for his ferry, but the place theretofore and then in actual use for it was assigned to the competing ferry. In this the town plainly deviated from its duty in the premises, for it was under the same legal obligation to accord a landing place to \n\n[274 U.S. 676, 684]\n\u00a0\n one ferry as to the other. We perceive no ground for holding that relief from such a deviation may not be had in a suit in equity. No case brought to our attention so holds. Certainly Watson v. Turnbull, 34 La. Ann. 856, cited by the town, does not do so.\n The complainant's objection to the court's designation appears meritorious at first, but it is otherwise when consideration is given to the settled rule in Louisiana that the banks of navigable streams are subject to a servitude permitting their use for public purposes including those incident to navigation, and that:\n'Riparian proprietors have no right to appropriate to their exclusive use these banks, and they have no private property in the use thereof, which is public.' Rev. Civ. Code, arts. 455, 457, 665; Watson v. Turnbull, supra.\n\n This servitude had existed in Louisiana since before the creation of the state, and has been recognized by this court and held consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. Eldridge v. Trezevant, \n160 \nU.S. 452\n, 16 S. Ct. 345. Thus the complainant's ownership of the adjacent lots does not entitle him to be preferred over others in the use of the bank as a landing place. Nor does his prior use entitle him to have the other ferry excluded; for the evidence indicates that there is sufficient room on the two sides of Concordia street for both. And so far as appears the ramp constructed by him still may be used in going to and from his docks. In these circumstances, we think the court's designation of the landing places should not be disturbed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCDONALD v. MAXWELL(1927)\nNo. 147\nArgued: January 20, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles V. Imlay, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the course of a proceeding that had been pending for many years in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sitting as a probate court, for the administration of the estate of James McDonald, deceased, under his last will and testament, the executors were allowed certain commissions for the one-year period covered by their ninth account. On an appeal by the beneficiaries under the will, two of whom are minors represented by a guardian ad litem, the District Court of Appeals, being of opinion that there was 'nothing on the face of the record to indicate error,' affirmed the judgment allowing \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n these commissions (55 App. D. C. 375, 6 F.(2d) 678), and this writ of certiorari was thereupon granted (\n269 \nU.S. 542\n, 46 S. Ct. 20).\n A motion by the executors to dismiss the writ and affirm the judgment, on the ground, in effect, that the record presents no substantial question for review, was postponed to the hearing; and the case has been heard on this motion and on the merits.\n The record-aside from formal and undisputed matters-consists of the account filed by the executors, a report and exception by the guardian ad litem, an exception by the adult beneficiary, and the order of the court allowing the commissions. From these it appears that the executors, in August, 1923, filed their ninth account, covering the period. from July 11, 1922, to July 12, 1923, hereinafter referred to as the accounting period. In this account they stated, under the heading of 'Receipts Principal Account,' that, in addition to the balance of principal in their hands on July 11, 1922, shown by their eighth account, they had charged themselves with the profits received during the accounting period from the sales of certain inventoried items, aggregating $1,604.32, and with certain shares of stock which they had received during the accounting period as stock dividends, 'at the face or par value thereof,' aggregating $1,570,325, making a total of $1,571,929.32, and that they 'claim and hereby retain for their services a commission of 5 per cent. upon profits realized on proceeds of inventoried items, and the par or face value of stocks received as dividend, viz. $1,571,929.32-$78,596.47.'\n They further stated, under the heading 'Income Account,' that, in addition to the balance of income shown by their eighth account, they had charged themselves with income received during the accounting period on the property owned by the estate, aggregating $247,814.39, and that they 'also claim and hereby retain for their services a commission of 5 per cent. upon the \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n annual income and profit on income investments received $12,390.72.'\n The guardian ad litem, pursuant to a former order of the court, filed a report concerning the matters involved in this account, in which, after pointing out that the executors on their previous accounts had been allowed commissions of more than $200,000 upon the principal of the estate and $50,000 upon on the income, he insisted that the sum of $12,390.72, claimed as commission on the income received, was a sufficient compensation for their services during the accounting period; and that, as to the additional commission of $78,596.47, claimed on an 'increase in principal' of $1,571,929.32, the stock dividends of $1,570,325, of which this mainly consisted, were 'not a proper basis upon which to charge a commission'; and he specifically 'except(ed) to the requested allowance of $ 78,596.47 for commission on principal.'\n The adult beneficiary also filed an exception to the account, upon the ground that 'the commissions claimed, in large part, are based upon an alleged increase in the capital assets of said estate, ... consisting in the issuance to said estate, as the holder of stock in a large number of corporations, of stock dividends, when, as a matter of law and of fact, the issuance of said stock dividends added nothing to the interest of said estate as a shareholder in said corporations, but merely changed the evidence of said interest, in the shape of stock certificates,' and 'the issuance of stock dividends to said estate cannot be considered as an increase of either capital or income.'\n Thereafter the court, without handing down an opinion, entered an order reciting that, the ninth account of the executors 'being now presented for approval, the same is, after examination by the court, approved and passed; the executors being allowed $12,390.72 commission on income, as claimed, but being hereby allowed \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n $50,000 commission on increase in principal, instead of $78,596.47 claimed.'\n It thus is apparent that the court allowed the commission of $50,000 'upon profits realized on proceeds of inventoried items, and the par or face value of stocks received as dividend, viz. $1,571,929.32,' for which the executors had claimed a commission of $78,596.47, on the ground that these profits and the par or face value of the stock dividends constituted an 'increase in principal' upon which a commission could be allowed.\n The beneficiaries do not challenge here so much of this allowance as was based on the $1,604.32 of profits realized from inventoried items, on which the executors claimed a commission of 5 per cent., or $80.22. And the sole question presented is whether the remainder of the $50,000 allowed as a 'commission on increase in principal'-that is, at least $49, 019.78, which was based solely on the $1,570,325 of stock dividends-was properly allowed.\n The Court of Appeals, after stating that the orders in a proceeding in the District probate court are reviewable only in accordance with the practice at common law by which the evidence must be brought up in a bill of exceptions, and that the record did not contain any bill of exceptions or purport to show the substance of the testimony, said:\n'The court below, evidently after a hearing in which all pertinent facts and circumstances were considered, reached the conclusion that the executors were entitled to $50,000 commission on increase in principal, and made that allowance. The facts and circumstances upon which this allowance was based are not before us, and, there being nothing on the face of the record to indicate error, it is apparent that the judgment must be affirmed. ...'\n\n We think this was error.\n This proceeding is not like one for the probate of a will involving an issue as to the competency of the testator, in \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n which the parties have a right to a trial by jury and to bills of exception covering the rulings of the court during the progress of the trial, and a review may he had upon writ of error (Ormsby v. Webb, \n134 \nU.S. 47, 64\n, 10 S. Ct. 478), but one in which the District Supreme Court, sitting in probate, is clothed, as an orphans' court, with power to proceed with the settlement and distribution of the estate in accordance with equitable principles and procedure, and a controversy in matter of law raised by the exceptions of the beneficiaries to the executors' account, and apparent on the record, is reviewable on appeal ( Kenaday v. Sinnott, \n179 \nU.S. 606, 614\n, 21 S. Ct. 233).\n Here the exceptions raised no issue as to matters of fact stated in the executors' account, but a question of law merely. There is no recital in the record that the order was based upon any evidence submitted, no reference to the hearing of any evidence, and nothing, we think, from which any inference can be rightly drawn that the court made an investigation of any matters not shown by the executors' account, or allowed the commission on the stock dividends on any ground other than that, as matter of law, the receipt of the stock dividends constituted an 'increase in principal' of the estate.\n And as to this we think the ruling was erroneous. There was, it is to be noted, no statement in the executors' account that the aggregate value of the dividend shares received and the original shares on hand at the commencement of the accounting period, was any greater than the value of the original shares alone before the dividend shares were issued, or that the value of the principal of the estate had increased in any manner during the accounting period. They made no claim for the allowance of an additional commission on the ground that there had been such an increase; their sole claim being, as shown by their account, that they were entitled \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 97]\n\u00a0\n to the additional commission by reason of the fact that they had received stock dividends of the par value stated. And, for aught that appeared from their account, the combined value of the original shares and the dividend shares was precisely the same at the end of the accounting period as the value of the original shares alone at its commencement.\n Assuming, but not deciding, that, if the executors' account had shown an increase in the value of the principal of the estate during the accounting period, this, if claimed, would have been a proper basis for the allowance of an additional commission, it is clear that the mere fact that the executors had received the stock dividends during the accounting period did not show any increase in the principal of the estate.\n In Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 \nU.S. 549, 559\n, 565 S., 10 S. Ct. 1057, 1058 ( 34 L. Ed. 525), in determining whether a stock dividend accrued to the tenant for life under a trust estate, this court said: 'A stock dividend really takes nothing from the property of the corporation, and adds nothing to the interests of the shareholders. Its property is not diminished, and their interests are not increased. After such a dividend, as before, the corporation has the title in all the corporate property; the aggregate interests therein of all the shareholders are represented by the whole number of shares; and the proportional interest of each shareholder remains the same. The only change is in the evidence which represents that interest; the new shares and the original shares together representing the same proportional interest that the original shares represented before the issue of new ones.' And the court quoted with approval the statement in Williams v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 93 N. Y. 162, 189, that:\n'After such a dividend the aggregate of the stockholders own no more interest in the corporation than before. The whole number of shares \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n before the stock dividend represented the whole property of the corporation, and after the dividend they represent that and no more. A stock dividend does not distribute property, but simply dilutes the shares as they existed before.'\n\n So in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 211\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 194 (64 L. Ed. 521, 9 A. L. R. 1570) in which it was held that stock dividends were not taxable as income, the court said:\n'The essential and controlling fact is that the stockholder has received nothing out of the company's assets for his separate use and benefit; on the contrary, every dollar of his original investment, together with whatever accretions and accumulations have resulted from employment of his money and that of the other stockholders in the business of the company, still remains the property of the company, and subject to business risks which may result in wiping out the entire investment. Having regard to the very truth of the matter, to substance and not to form, he has received nothing that answers the definition of income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.'\n\n It is apparent, in the light of these decisions, that the stock dividends received by the executors represented no real increase in the principal of the estate during the accounting period. They merely changed the form of the estate's investment in the corporate stocks by increasing the number of its shares, but left the aggregate value of all its shares the same as that before the dividend shares were issued. After their issuance, which necessarily 'diluted' the value of the original shares, the dividend shares and the original shares together represented the same proportional interest in the corporate properties that had previously been represented by the original shares alone; no more and no less. Clearly, therefore, the dividend shares themselves represented no increase in the value of the estate, and they could not properly be taken as the basis for the allowance of a commission to the \n\n[274 U.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n executors on the theory that their receipt, in and of itself, constituted an increase in its capital.\n The executors' motion to dismiss and affirm must accordingly be denied; and the judgment reversed. But, the court being advised that the respondent Maxwell, one of the executors, has died since January 20, 1927, the day on which this case was argued and submitted, the judgment here will be entered nunc pro tunc as of that day.

DAUGHERTY(1927)\nNo. 28\nArgued: December 5, 1924Decided: January 17, 1927\n\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. George W. Wickersham, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 144]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur I. Vorys, of Columbus, Ohio, and John P. Phillips, of Chillicothe, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 150]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the final order in a proceeding in habeas corpus discharging a recusant witness held in custody under process of attachment issued from the United States Senate in the course of an investigation which it was making of the administration of the Department of Justice. A full statement of the case is necessary.\n The Department of Justice is one of the great executive departments established by congressional enactment, and has charge, among other things, of the initiation and prosecution of all suits, civil and criminal, which may be brought in the right and name of the United States to compel obedience or punish disobedience to its laws, to recover property obtained from it by unlawful or fraudulent means, or to safeguard its rights in other respects, and also of the assertion and protection of its interests, when it or its officers are sued by others. The Attorney General is the head of the department, and its functions are all to be exercised under his supervision and direction. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Harry M. Daugherty became the Attorney General March 5, 1921, and held that office until March 28, 1924, \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 151]\n\u00a0\n when he resigned. Late in that period various charges of misfeasance and nonfeasance in the Department of Justice after he became its supervising head were brought to the attention of the Senate by individual senators and made the basis of an insistent demand that the department be investigated to the end that the practices and deficiencies which, according to the charges, were operating to prevent or impair its right administration might be definitely ascertained and that appropriate and effective measures might be taken to remedy or eliminate the evil. The Senate regarded the charges as grave and requiring legislative attention and action. Accordingly it formulated, passed, and invited the House of Representatives to pass (and that body did pass) two measures taking important litigation then in immediate contemplation out of the control of the Department of Justice and placing the same in charge of special counsel to be appointed by the President, 2 and also adopted a resolution authorizing and directing a select committee of five senators-\n'to investigate circumstances and facts, and report the same to the Senate, concerning the alleged failure of Harry M. Daugherty, Attorney General of the United States, to prosecute properly violators of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Act against monopolies and unlawful restraint of trade; the alleged neglect and failure of the said Harry M. Daugherty, Attorney General of the United States, to arrest and prosecute Albert B. Fall, Harry F. Sinclair, E. L. Doheny, C. R. Forbes, and their co-conspirators in defrauding the government, as well as the alleged neglect and failure of the said Attorney General to arrest and prosecute many others for violations of federal statutes, and his alleged failure \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 152]\n\u00a0\n to prosecute properly, efficiently, and promptly, and to defend, all manner of civil and criminal actions wherein the government of the United States is interested as a party plaintiff or defendant. And said committee is further directed to inquire into, investigate and report to the Senate the activities of the said Harry M. Daugherty, Attorney General, and any of his assistants in the Department of Justice which would in any manner tend to impair their efficiency or influence as representatives of the government of the United States.'\n\n The resolution also authorized the committee to send for books and papers, to subpoena witnesses, to administer oaths, and to sit at such times and places as it might deem advisable. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In the course of the investigation the committee issued and caused to be duly served on Mally S. Daugherty-who was a brother of Harry M. Daugherty and president of the Midland National Bank of Washington Court House, Ohio-a subpoena commanding him to appear before the committee for the purpose of giving testimony bearing on the subject under investigation, and to bring with him the 'deposit ledgers of the Midland National Bank since November 1, 1920; also note files and transcript of owners of every safety vault; also records of income drafts; also records of any individual account or accounts showing withdrawals of amounts of $25,000 or over during above period.' The witness failed to appear.\n A little later in the course of the investigation the committee issued and caused to be duly served on the same witness another subpoena, commanding him to appear before it for the purpose of giving testimony relating to the subject under consideration; nothing being \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 153]\n\u00a0\n said in this subpoena about bringing records, books, or papers. The witness again failed to appear, and no excuse was offered by him for either failure.\n The committee then made a report to the Senate stating that the subpoenas had been issued, that according to the officer's returns-copies of which accompanied the report-the witness was personally served, and that he had failed and refused to appear. \n4\n After a reading of the report, the Senate adopted a resolution5 following these facts and proceedings as follows:\n'Whereas, the appearance and testimony of the said M. S. Daugherty is material and necessary in order that the committee may properly execute the functions imposed upon it and may obtain information necessary as a basis for such legislative and other action as the Senate may deem necessary and proper: Therefore be it\n\n'Resolved, that the president of the Senate pro tempore issue his warrant commanding the sergeant at arms or his deputy to take into custody the body of the said M. S. Daugherty wherever found, and to bring the said M. S. Daugherty before the bar of the Senate, then and there to answer such questions pertinent to the matter under inquiry as the Senate may order the President of the Senate pro tempore to propound, and to keep the said M. S. Daugherty in custody to await the further order of the Senate.'\n\n It will be observed from the terms of the resolution that the warrant was to be issued in furtherance of the effort be obtain the personal testimony of the witness, and, like the second subpoena, was not intended to exact from him the production of the various records, books, and papers named in the first subpoena.\n The warrant was issued agreeably to the resolution and was addressed simply to the sergeant at arms. That \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 154]\n\u00a0\n officer, on receiving the warrant, indorsed thereon a direction that it be executed by John J. McGrain, already his deputy, and delivered it to him for execution.\n The deputy, proceeding under the warrant, took the witness into custody at Cincinnati, Ohio, with the purpose of bringing him before the bar of the Senate as commanded, whereupon the witness petitioned the federal District Court in Cincinnati for a writ of habeas corpus. The writ was granted and the deputy made due return, setting forth the warrant and the cause of the detention. After a hearing the court held the attachment and detention unlawful and discharged the witness, the decision being put on the ground that the Senate, in directing the investigation and in ordering the attachment, exceeded its powers under the Constitution. 299 F. 620. The deputy prayed and was allowed a direct appeal to this court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) as then existing.\n We have given the case earnest and prolonged consideration because the principal questions involved are of unusual importance and delicacy. They are (a) whether the Senate-or the House of Representatives, both being on the same plane in this regard-has power, through its own process, to compel a private individual to appear before it or one of its committees and give testimony needed to enable it efficiently to exercise a legislative function belonging to it under the Constitution; and (b) whether it sufficiently appears that the process was being employed in this instance to obtain testimony for that purpose.\n Other questions are presented, which in regular course should be taken up first.\n The witness challenges the authority of the deputy to execute the warrant on two grounds-that there was no provision of law for a deputy, and that, even if there were such a provision, a deputy could not execute the \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 155]\n\u00a0\n warrant because it was addressed simply to the sergeant at arms. We are of opinion that neither ground is tenable.\n The Senate adopted in 1889 and has retained ever since a standing order declaring that the sergeant at arms may appoint deputies 'to serve process or perform other duties' in his stead, that they shall be 'officers of the Senate,' and that acts done and returns made by them 'shall have like effect and be of the same validity as if performed or made by the sergeant at arms in person.' \n6\n In actual practice the Senate has given full effect to the order, and Congress has sanctioned the practice under it by recognizing the deputies-sometimes called assistants- as officers of the Senate, by fixing their compensation, and by making appropriations to pay them. \n7\n Thus there was ample provision of law for a deputy.\n The fact that the warrant was addressed simply to the sergeant at arms is not of special significance. His authority was not to be tesed by the warrant alone. Other criteria were to be considered. The standing order and the resolution under which the warrant was issued plainly contemplated that he was to be free to execute the warrant in person or to direct a deputy to execute it. They expressed the intention of the Senate, and the words of the warrant were to be taken, as they well could be, in a sense which would give effect to that intention. Thus understood, the warrant admissibly could be executed by a deputy, if the sergeant at arms so directed, which he did.\n The case of Sanborn v. Carleton, 15 Gray (Mass.) 339, on which the witness relies, related to a warrant issued to the sergeant at arms in 1860, which he deputed another to execute. At that time there was no standing rule or \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 156]\n\u00a0\n statute permitting him to act through a deputy, nor was there anything in the resolution under which the warrant was issued indicative of a purpose to permit him to do so. All that was decided was that, in the absence of a permissive provision, in the warrant or elsewhere, he could not commit its execution to another. The provision which was absent in that case and deemed essential is present in this.\n The witness points to the provision in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution declaring 'no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,' and contends that the warrant was void because the report of the committee on which it was based was unsworn. We think the contention overlooks the relation of the committee to the Senate and to the matters reported, and puts aside the accepted interpretation of the constitutional provision.\n The committee was a part of the Senate, and its members were acting under their oath of office as senators. The matters reported pertained to their proceedings and were within their own knowledge. They had issued the subpoenas, had received and examined the officer's returns thereon (copies of which accompanied the report), and knew the witness had not obeyed either subpoena, or offered any excuse for his failure to do so.\n The constitutional provision was not intended to establish a new principle, but to affirm and preserve a cherished rule of the common law, designed to prevent the issue of groundless warrants. In legislative practice, committee reports are regarded as made under the sanction of the oath of office of its members, and where the matters reported are within the committee's knowledge and constitute probable cause for an attachment, such reports are acted on and given effect, without requiring that they be supported by further oath or affirmation. This is \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 157]\n\u00a0\n not a new practice, but one which has come down from an early period. It was well recognized before the constitutional provision was adopted, has been followed ever since, and appears never to have been challenged until now. Thus it amounts to a practical interpretation, long continued, of both the original common-law rule and the affirming constitutional provision, and should be given effect accordingly. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The principle underlying the legislative practice has also been recognized and applied in judicial proceedings. This is illustrated by the settled rulings that courts, in dealing with contempts committed in their presence, may order commitments without other proof than their own knowledge of the occurrence, 9 and that they may issue attachments, based on their own knowledge of the default, where intended witnesses or jurors fail to appear in obedience to process shown by the officer's return to have been duly served. \n10\n A further illustration is found in the rulings that grand jurors, acting under the sanction of their oath as such, may find and return indictments based solely on their own knowledge of the particular offenses, and that warrants may be issued on such indictments without further oath or affirmation,11 and still another is found in the practice which recognizes that, where grand jurors, under their oath as such, report to the court that a witness brought before them has refused to testify, the \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 158]\n\u00a0\n court may act on that report, although otherwise unsworn, and order the witness brought before it by attachment. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n We think the legislative practice, fortified as it is by the judicial practice, shows that the report of the committee-which was based on the committee's own knowledge and made under the sanction of the oath of office of its members-was sufficiently supported by oath to satisfy the constitutional requirement.\n The witness also points to the provision in the warrant, and in the resolution under which it was issued, requiring that he be 'brought before the bar of the Senate, then and there' to give testimony 'pertinent to the subject under inquiry,' and contends that an essential prerequisite to such an attachment was wanting, because he neither had been subpoenaed to appear and testify before the Senate nor had refused to do so. The argument in support of the contention proceeds on the assumption that the warrant of attachment 'is to be treated precisely the same as if no subpoena had been issued by the committee, and the same as if the witness had not refused to testify before the committee.' In our opinion the contention and the assumption are both untenable. The committee was acting for the Senate and under its authorization, and therefore the subpoenas which the committee issued and the witness refused to obey are to be treated as if issued by the Senate. The warrant was issued as an auxiliary process to compel him to give the testimony sought by the subpoenas; and its nature in this respect is not affected by the direction that his testimony be given at the bar of the Senate, instead of before the committee. If the Senate deemed it proper, in view of his contumacy, to give that direction, it was at liberty to do so.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 159]\n\u00a0\n The witness sets up an interlocutory injunction granted by a state court at Washington Court House. Ohio, in a suit brought by the Midland National Bank against two members of the investigating committee, and contends that the attachment was in violation of that injunction and therefore unlawful. The contention is plainly ill-founded. The injunction was granted the same day the second subpoena was served, but whether earlier or later in the day does not appear. All that the record discloses about the injunction is comprised in the paragraph copied in the margin from the witness' petition for habeas corpus. 13 But it is apparent, from what is disclosed, that the injunction did not purport to place any restraint on the witness, nor to restrain the committee from demanding that he appear and testify personally to what he knew respecting the subject under investigation, and also that what the injunction did purport to restrain has no bearing on the power of the Senate to enforce that demand by attachment. \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 160]\n\u00a0\n In approaching the principal questions, which remain to be considered, two observations are in order. One is that we are not now concerned with the direction in the first subpoena that the witness produce various records, books, and papers of the Midland National Bank. That direction was not repeated in the second subpoena, and is not sought to be enforced by the attachment. This was recognized by the court below (299 F. 623), and is conceded by counsel for the appellant. The other is that we are not now concerned with the right of the Senate to propound or the duty of the witness to answer specific questions, for as yet no questions have been propounded to him. He is asserting-and is standing on his assertion-that the Senate is without power to interrogate him, even if the questions propounded be pertinent and otherwise legitimate, which for present purposes must be assumed.\n The first of the principal questions, the one which the witness particularly presses on our attention, is, as before shown, whether the Senate-or the House of Representatives, both being on the same plane in this regard-has power, through its own process, to compel a private individual to appear before it or one of its committees and give testimony needed to enable it efficiently to exercise a legislative function belonging to it under the Constitution.\n The Constitution provides for a Congress, consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives, and invests it with 'all legislative powers' granted to the United States, and with power 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper' for carrying into execution these powers and 'all other powers' vested by the Constitution in the United States or in any department or officer thereof. Article 1,  1, 8. Other provisions show that, while bills can become laws only after being considered and passed by both houses of Congress, each house is to be distinct \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 161]\n\u00a0\n from the other, to have its own officers and rules, and to exercise its legislative function independently. \n14\n Article 1,  2, 3, 5, 7. But there is no provision expressly investing either house with power to make investigations and exact testimony, to the end that it may exercise its legislative function advisedly and effectively. So the question arises whether this power is so far incidental to the legislative function as to be implied.\n In actual legislative practice, power to sesure needed information by such means haslong been treated as an attribute of the power to legislate. It was so regarded in the British Parliament and in the colonial Legislatures before the American Revolution, and a like view has prevailed and been carried into effect in both houses of Congress and in most of the state Legislatures. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n This power was both asserted and exerted by the House of Representatives in 1792, when it appointed a select committee to inquire into the St. Clair expedition and authorized the committee to send for necessary persons, papers and records. Mr. Madison, who had taken an important part in framing the Constitution only five years before, and four of his associates in that work, were members of the House of Representatives at the time, and all voted for the inquiry. 3 Cong. Ann. 494. Other exertions of the power by the House of Representatives, as also by the Senate, are shown in the citations already made. Among those by the Senate, the inquiry ordered in 1859 respecting the raid by John Brown and his adherents on the armory and arsenal of the United States at Harper's Ferry is of special significance. The resolution \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 162]\n\u00a0\n directing the inquiry authorized the committee to send for persons and papers, to inquire into the facts pertaining to the raid and the means by which it was organized and supported, and to report what legislation, if any, was necessary to preserve the pease of the country and protect the public property. The resolution was briefly discussed and adopted without opposition. Cong. Globe, 36th Cong. 1st Sess. pp. 141, 152. Later on the committee reported that Thaddeus Hyatt, although subpoenaed to appear as a witness, had refused to do so; whereupon the Senate ordered that he be attached and brought before it to answer for his refusal. When he was brought in, he answered by challenging the power of the Senate to direct the inquiry and exact testimony to aid it is exercising its legislative function. The question of power thus presented was thoroughly discussed by several senators-Mr. Sumner of Massachusetts taking the lead in denying the power, and Mr. Fessenden of Maine in supporting it. Sectional and party lines were put aside, and the question was debated and determined with special regard to principle and precedent. The vote was taken on a resolution pronouncing the witness' answer insufficient and directing that he be committed until he should signify that he was ready and willing to testify. The resolution was adopted-44 senators voting for it and 10 against. Cong. Globe, 36th Cong. 1st. Sess. pp. 1100-1109, 3006, 3007. The arguments advanced in support of the power are fairly reflected by the following excerpts from the debate:\n'Mr. Fessenden of Maine: 'Where will you stop? Stop, I say, just at that point where we have gone far enough to accomplish the purposes for which we were created; and these purposes are defined in the Constitution. What are they? The great purpose is legislation. There are some other things, but I speak of legislation as the principal purpose. Now, what do we propose to do here? We \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 163]\n\u00a0\n propose to legislate upon a given state of facts, perhaps, or under a given necessity. Well, sir, proposing to legislate, we want information. We have it not ourselves. It is not to be presumed that we know everything; and if any body does presume it, it is a very great mistake, as we know by experience. We want information on certain subjects. How are we to get if? The Senator says, ask for it. I am ready to ask for it; but suppose the person whom we ask will not give it to us: what then? Have we not power to compel him to come before us? Is this power, which has been exercised by Parliament and by all legislative bodies down to the present day without dispute-the power to inquire into subjects upon which they are disposed to legislate-lost to us? Are we not in the possession of it? Are we deprived of it simply because we hold our power here under a Constitution which defines what our duties are, and what we are called upon to do?\n\n'Congress have appointed committees after committees, time after time, to make inquiries on subjects of legislation. Had we not power to do it? Nobody questioned our authority to do it. We have given them authority to send for persons and papers during the recess. Nobody questioned our authority. We appoint committees during the session, with power to send for persons and papers. Have we not that authority, if necessary to legislation? ...\n\n'Sir, with regard to myself, all I have to inquire into is: is this a legitimate and proper object, committed to me under the Constitution; and then, as to the mode of accomplishing it, I am ready to use judiciously, calmly, moderately, all the power which I believe is necessary and inherent, in order to do that which I am appointed to do; and, I take it, I violate no rights, either of the people generally or of the individual, by that course.'\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 164]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. Crittenden of Kentucky: 'I come now to a question where the cooperation of the two branches is not necessary. There are some things that the Senate may do. How? According to a mode of its own. Are we to ask the other branch of the Legislature to concede by law to us the power of making such an inquiry as we are now making? Has not each branch the right to make what inquiries and investigation it thinks proper to make for its own action? Undoubtedly. You say we must have a law for it. Can we have a law? Is it not, from the very nature of the case, incidental to you as a Senate, if you, as a Senate, have the power of instituting an inquiry and of proceeding with that inquiry? I have endeavored to show that we have that power. We have a right, in consequence of it, a necessary incidental power, to summon witnesses, if witnesses are necessary. Do we require the concurrence of the other house to that? It is a power of our own. If you have a right to do the thing of your own motion, you must have all powers that are necessary to do it.\n'The means of carrying into effect by law all the granted powers, is given where legislation is applicable and necessary; but there are subordinate matters, not amounting to laws; there are inquiries of the one house or the other house, which each house has a right to conduct; which each has, from the beginning, exercised the power to conduct; and each has, from the beginning, summoned witnesses. This has been the practice of the government from the beginning; and if we have a right to summon the witness, all the rest follows as a matter of course.'\n\n The deliberate solution of the question on that occasion has been accepted and followed on other occasions by both houses of Congress, and never has been rejected or questioned by either. \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 165]\n\u00a0\n The state courts quite generally have held that the power to legislate carries with it by necessary implication ample authority to obtain information needed in the rightful exercise of that power, and to employ compulsory process for the purpose.\n In Burnham v. Morrissey, 14 Gray, 226, 239, (74 Am. Dec. 676), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in sustaining an exertion of this power by one branch of the Legislature of that commonwealth, said:\n'The House of Representatives has many duties to perform, which necessarily require it to receive evidence, and examine witnesses . ... It has often occasion to acquire a certain knowledge of facts, in order to the proper performance of legislative duties. We therefore think it clear that it has the constitutional right to take evidence, to summon witnesses, and to compel them to attend and to testify. This power to summon and examine witnesses it may exercise by means of committees.'\n\n In Wilckens v. Willet, 40 N. Y. (1 Keyes) 521, 525, a case which presented the question whether the House of Representatives of the United States possesses this power, the Court of Appeals of New York said:\n'That the power exists there admits of no doubt whatever. It is a necessary incident to the sovereign power of making laws; and its exercise is often indispensable to the great end of enlightened, judicious, and wholesome legislation.'\n\n In People v. Keeler, 99 N. Y. 463, 482, 483, 2 N. E. 615, 624 (52 Am. Rep. 49), where the validity of a statute of New York recognizing and giving effect to this power was drawn in question, the Court of Appeals approvingly quoted what it had said in Wilckens v. Willet, and added:\n'It is difficult to conceive any constitutional objection which can be raised to the provisions authorizing legislative committees to take testimony and to summon \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 166]\n\u00a0\n witnesses. In many cases it may be indispensable to intelligent and effectual legislation to ascertain the facts which are claimed to give rise to the necessity for such legislation, and the remedy required, and irrespective of the question whether in the absence of a statute to that effect either house would have the power to imprison a recusant witness, I cannot yield to the claim that a statute authorizing it to enforce its process in that manner is in excess of the legislative power. To await the slow process of indictment and prosecution for a misdemeanor, might prove quite ineffectual, and necessary legislation might be obstructed, and perhaps defeated, if the legislative body had no other and more summary means of enforcing its right to obtain the required information. That the power may be abused, is no ground for denying its existence. It is a limited power, and should be kept within its proper bounds; and, when these are exceeded, a jurisdictional question is presented which is cognizable in the courts. ... Throughout this Union the practice of legislative bodies, and in this state, the statutes existing at the time the present Constitution was adopted, and whose validity has never before been questioned by our courts, afford strong arguments in favor of the recognition of the right of either house to compel the attendance of witnesses for legislative purposes, as one which has been generally conceded to be an appropriate adjunct to the power of legislation, and one which, to say the least, the state Legislature has constitutional authority to regulate and enforce by statute.'\n\n Other decisions by state courts recognizing and sustaining the legislative practice are found in Falvey v. Massing, 7 Wis. 630, 635-638; State v. Frear, 138 Wis. 173, 119 N. W. 894; Ex parte Parker, 74 S. C. 466, 470, 55 S. E. 122, 144 Am. St. Rep. 1011, 7 Ann. Cas. 874; Sullivan v. Hill, 73 W. Va. 49, 53, 79 S. E. 670, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 1115; Lowe v. Summers, 69 Mo. App. 637, 649, 650. An instructive decision on the question is also found in Ex parte Dansereau (1875) 19 L. C. Jur. 210, where the \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 167]\n\u00a0\n legislative assembly of the province of Quebec was held to possess this power as a necessary incident of its power to legislative.\n We have referred to the practice of the two houses of Congress, and we now shall notice some significant congressional enactments. May 3, 1798 ( 1 Stat. 554, c. 36), Congress provided that oaths or affirmations might be administered to witnesses by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the chairman of a committee of the whole, or the chairman of a select committee, 'in any case under their examination.' February 8, 1817 (3 Stat. 345, c. 10), it enlarged that provision so as to include the chairman of a standing committee. January 24, 1857 (11 Stat. 155, c. 19), it passed 'An act more effectually to enforce the attendance of witnesses on the summons of either house of Congress, and to compel them to discover testimony.' This act provided, first, that any person summoned as a witness to give testimony or produce papers in any matter under inquiry before either house of Congress, or any committee of either house, who should wilfully make default, or, if appearing, should refuse to answer any question pertinent to the inquiry, should, in addition to the pains and penalties then existing,16 be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to indictment as there prescribed; and, secondly, that no person should be excused from giving evidence in such an inquiry on the ground that it might tend to incriminate or disgrace him, nor be held to answer criminally, or be subjected to any penalty or forfeiture, for any fact or act as to which he was required to testify excepting that he might be subjected to prosecution for perjury committed while so testifying. January 24, 1862, c. 11, 12 Stat. 333, Congress modified the immunity provision in particulars not mate- \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 168]\n\u00a0\n rial here. These enactments are now embodied in sections 101-104 and 859 of Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  155, 157-159, 1467). They show very plainly that Congress intended thereby (a) to recognize the power of either house to institute inquiries and exact evidence touching subjects within its jurisdiction and on which it was disposed to act;17 (b) to recognize that such inquiries may be conducted through committees; (c) to subject defaulting and contumacious witnesses to indictment and punishment in the courts, and thereby to enable either house to exert the power of inquiry 'more effectually';18 and (d) to open the way for obtaining evidence in such an inquiry, which otherwise could not be obtained, by exempting witnesses required to give evidence therein from criminal and penal prosecutions in respect of matters disclosed by their evidence.\n Four decisions of this court are cited and more or less relied on, and we now turn to them.\n The first decision was in Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204. The question there was whether, under the Constitution, the House of Representatives has power to attach and punish a person other than a member for con- \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 169]\n\u00a0\n tempt of its authority-in fact, an attempt to bribe one of its members. The court regarded the power as essential to the effective exertion of other powers expressly granted, and therefore as implied. The argument advanced to the contrary was that as the Constitution expressly grants to each house power to punish or expel its own members and says nothing about punishing others, the implication or inference, if any, is that power to punish one who is not a member is neither given nor intended. The court answered this by saying:\n Page 225: 'There is not in the whole of that admirable instrument, a grant of powers which does not draw after it others, not expressed, but vital to their exercise; not substantive and independent, indeed, but auxiliary and subordinate.'\n Page 233: 'This argument proves too much; for its direct application would lead to the annihilation of almost every power of Congress. To enforce its laws upon any subject, without the sanction of punishments, is obviously impossible. Yet there is an express grant of power to punish in one class of cases, and one only, and all the punishing power exercised by Congress, in any cases, except those which relate the piracy and offenses against the laws of nations, is derived from implication. Nor did the idea ever occur to any one, that the express grant in one class of cases repelled the assumption of the punishing power in any other. The truth is, that the exercise of the powers given over their own members, was of such a delicate nature, that a constitutional provision became necessary to assert or communicate it. Constituted, as that body is, of the delegates of confederated states, some such provision was necessary to guard against their mutual jealousy, since every proceeding against a representative would indirectly affect the honor or interests of the state which sent him.' \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 170]\n\u00a0\n The next decision was in Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 U.S. 168\n. The question there was whether the House of Representatives had exceeded its power in directing one of its committees to make a particular investigation. The decision was that it had. The principles announced and applied in the case are that neither house of Congress possesses a 'general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen'; that the power actually possessed is limited to inquiries relating to matters of which the particular house 'has jurisdiction' and in respect of which it rightfully may take other action; that, if the inquiry relates to 'a matter wherein relief or redress could be had only by a judicial proceeding,' it is not within the range of this power, but must be left to the courts, conformably to the constitutional separation of governmental powers; and that for the purpose of determining the essential character of the inquiry recourse may be had to the resolution or order under which it is made. The court examined the resolution which was the basis of the particular inquiry, and ascertained therefrom that the inquiry related to a private real estate pool or partnership in the District of Columbia. Jay Cook & Co. had had an interest in the pool, but had become bankrupts, and their estate was in course of administration in a federal bankruptcy court in Pennsylvania. The United States was one of their creditors. The trustee in the bankruptcy proceeding had effected a settlement of the bankrupts' interest in the pool, and of course his action was subject to examination and approval or disapproval by the bankruptcy court. Some of the creditors, including the United States, were dissatisfied with the settlement. In these circumstances, disclosed in the preamble, the resolution directed the committee 'to inquire into the matter and history of said real estate pool and the character of said settlement, with the amount of property involved in which Jay Cooke & Co. \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 171]\n\u00a0\n were interests, and the amount paid or to be paid in said settlement, with power to send for persons and papers and report to this house.' The court pointed out that the resolution contained no suggestion of contemplated legislation; that the matter was one in respect to which no valid legislation could be had; that the bankrupts' estate and the trustee's settlement were still pending in the bankruptcy court; and that the United States and other creditors were free to press their claims in that proceeding. And on these grounds the court held that in undertaking the investigation 'the House of Representatives not only exceeded the limit of its own authority, but assumed a power which could only be properly exercised by another branch of the government, because it was in its nature clearly judicial.'\n The case has been cited at times, and is cited to us now, as strongly intimating, if not holding, that neither house of Congress has power to make inquires and exact evidence in aid of contemplated legislation. There are expressions in the opinion which, separately considered, might bear such an interpretation; but that this was not intended is shown by the immediately succeeding statement (page 189) that:\n'This latter proposition is one which we do not propose to decide in the present case, because we are able to decide it without passing upon the existence or nonexistence of such a power in aid of the legislative function.'\n\n Next in order is In re Chapman, \n166 \nU.S. 661\n, 17 S. Ct. 677. The inquiry there in question was conducted under a resolution of the Senate and related to charges, published in the press, that Senators were yielding to corrupt influences in considering a tariff bill then before the Senate and were speculating in stocks the value of which would be affected by pending amendments to the bill. Chapman appeared before the committee in response to a subpoena, but refused to answer questions pertinent to the inquiry, and \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 172]\n\u00a0\n was indicted and convicted under the act of 1857 for his refusal. The court sustained the constitutional validity of the act of 1857, and, after referring to the constitutional provision empowering either house to punish its members for disorderly behavior and by a vote of two-thirds to expel a member, held that the inquiry related to the integrity and fidelity of Senators in the discharge of their duties, and therefore to a matter 'within the range of the constitutional powers of the Senate' and in respect to which it could compel witnesses to appear and testify. In overruling an objection that the inquiry was without any defined or admissible purpose, in that the preamble and resolution made no reference to any contemplated expulsion, censure, or other action by the Senate, the court held that they adequately disclosed a subject-matter of which the Senate had jurisdiction, that it was not essential that the Senate declare in advance what it meditated doing, and that the assumption could not be indulged that the Senate was making the inquiry without a legitimate object.\n The case is relied on here as fully sustaining the power of either house to conduct investigations and exact testimony from witnesses for legislative purposes. In the course of the opinion (page 671 (17 S. Ct. 681)) it is said that disclosures by witnesses may be compelled constitutionally \"to enable the respective bodies to discharge their legitimate functions,' and that it was to effect this that the act of 1857 was passed,' and also:\n'We grant that Congress could not divest itself, or either of its houses, of the essential and inherent power to punish for contempt, in cases to which the power of either house properly extended; but, because Congress, by the act of 1857, sought to aid each of the houses in the discharge of its constitutional functions, it does not follow that any delegation of the power in each to punish for contempt was involved.'\n\n The terms 'legitimate functions' and 'constitutional functions' \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 173]\n\u00a0\n are broad, and might well be regarded as including the legislative function; but as the case in hand did not call for any expression respecting that function, it hardly can be be said that these terms were purposely used as including it.\n The latest case is Marshall v. Gordon, \n243 \nU.S. 521\n, 37 S. Ct. 448, L. R. A. 1917F, 279, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 371. The question there was whether the House of Representatives exceeded its power in punishing, as for a contempt of its authority, a person-not a member-who had written, published, and sent to the chairman of one of its committees an ill-tempered and irritating letter respecting the action and purposes of the committee. Power to make inquiries and obtain evidence by compulsory process was not involved. The court recognized distinctly that the House of Representatives has implied power to punish a person not a member for contempt, as was ruled in Anderson v. Dunn, supra, but held that its action in this instance was without constitutional justification. The decision was put on the ground that the letter, while offensive and vexatious, was not calculated or likely to affect the House in any of its proceedings or in the exercise of any of its functions-in short, that the act which was punished as a contempt was not of such a character as to bring it within the rule that an express power draws after it others which are necessary and appropriate to give effect to it.\n While these cases are not decisive of the question we are considering, they definitely settle two propositions which we recognize as entirely sound and having a bearing on its solution: One, that the two houses of Congress, in their separate relations, possess, not only such powers as are expressly granted to them by the Constitution, but such auxiliary powers as are necessary and appropriate to make the express powers effective; and the other, that neither house is invested with 'general' power to inquire into private affairs and compel disclo- \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 174]\n\u00a0\n sures, but only with such limited power of inquiry as is shown to exist when the rule of constitutional interpretation just stated is rightly applied. The latter proposition has further support in Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n211 U.S. 407\n, 417-419, 29 S. Ct. 115, and Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298, 305\n, 306 S., 44 S. Ct. 336, 32 A. L. R. 786.\n With this review of the legislative practice, congressional enactments, and court decisions, we proceed to a statement of our conclusions on the question.\n We are of opinion that the power of inquiry-with process to enforce it-is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. It was so regarded and employed in American Legislatures before the Constitution was framed and ratified. Both houses of Congress took this view of it early in their history-the House of Representatives with the approving votes of Mr. Madison and other members whose service in the convention which framed the Constitution gives special significance to their action-and both houses have employed the power accordingly up to the present time. The acts of 1798 and 1857, judged by their comprehensive terms, were intended to recognize the existence of this power in both houses and to enable them to employ it 'more effectually' than before. So, when their practice in the matter is appraised according to the circumstances in which it was begun and to those in which it has been continued, it falls nothing short of a practical construction, long continued, of the constitutional provisions respecting their powers, and therefore should be taken as fixing the meaning of those provisions, if otherwise doubtful. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 175]\n\u00a0\n We are further of opinion that the provisions are not of doubtful meaning, but, as was held by this court in the cases we have reviewed, are intended to be effectively exercised, and therefore to carry with them such auxiliary powers as are necessary and appropriate to that end. While the power to exact information in aid of the legislative function was not involved in those cases, the rule of interpretation applied there is applicable here. A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information-which not infrequently is true-recourse must be had to others who do possess it. Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that period the power of inquiry, with enforcing process, was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate-indeed, was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is ample warrant for thinking, as we do, that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised.\n The contention is earnestly made on behalf of the witness that this power of inquiry, if sustained, may be abusively and oppressively exerted. If this be so, it affords no ground for denying the power. The same contention might be directed against the power to legislate, and of course would be unavailing. We must assume, for present purposes, that neither houses will be disposed to exert the power beyond its proper bounds, or with \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 176]\n\u00a0\n out due regard to the rights of witnesses. But if, contrary to this assumption, controlling limitations or restrictions are disregarded, the decisions in Kilbourn v. Thompson and Marshall v. Gordon point to admissible measures of relief. And it is a necessary deduction from the decisions in Kilbourn v. Thompson and In re Chapman that a witness rightfully may refuse to answer where the bounds of the power are exceeded or the questions are not pertinent to the matter undre inquiry.\n We come now to the question whether it sufficiently appears that the purpose for which the witness' testimony was sought was to obtain information in aid of the legislative function. The court below answered the question in the negative and put its decision largely on this ground, as is shown by the following excerpts from its opinion (299 F. 638-640):\n'It will be noted that in the second resolution the Senate has expressly avowed that the investigation is in aid of other action than legislation. Its purpose is to 'obtain information necessary as a basis for such legislative and other action as the Senate may deem necessary and proper.' This indicates that the Senate is contemplating the taking of action other than legislative, as the outcome of the investigation, at least the possibility of so doing. The extreme personal cast of the original resolutions; the spirit of hostility towards the then Attorney General which they breathe; that it was not avowed that legislative action was had in view until after the action of the Senate had been challenged; and that the avowal then was coupled with an avowal that other action was had in view-are calculated to create the impression that the idea of legislative action being in contemplation was an afterthought. ...\n\n'That the Senate has in contemplation the possibility of taking action other than legislation as an outcome of the investigation, as thus expressly avowed, would seem \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 177]\n\u00a0\n of itself to invalidate the entire proceeding. But, whether so or not, the Senate's action is invalid and absolutely void, in that, in ordering and conducting the investigation, it is exercising the judicial function, and power to exercise that function, in such a case as we have here, has not been conferred upon it expressly or by fair implication. What it is proposing to do is to determine the guilt of the Attorney General of the shortcomings and wrongdoings set forth in the resolutions. It is 'to hear, adjudge, and condemn.' It so doing it is exercising the judicial function. ...\n\n'What the Senate is engaged in doing is not investigating the Attorney General's office; it is investigating the former Attorney General. What it has done is to put him on trial before it. In so doing it is exercising the judicial function. This it has no power to do.'\n\n We are of opinion that the court's ruling on this question was wrong, and that it sufficiently appears, when the proceedings are rightly interpreted, that the object of the investigation and of the effort to secure the witness' testimony was to obtain information for legislative purposes.\n It is quite true that the resolution directing the investigation does not in terms avow that it is intended to be in aid of legislation; but it does show that the subject to be investigated was the administration of the Department of Justice-whether its functions were being properly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected, and particularly whether the Attorney General and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings to punish crimes and enforce appropriate remedies against the wrongdoers; specific instances of alleged neglect being recited. Plainly the subject was one on which legislation could be had and would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit. \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 178]\n\u00a0\n This becomes manifest when it is reflected that the functions of the Department of Justice, the powers and duties of the Attorney General, and the duties of his assistants are all subject to regulation by congressional legislation, and that the department is maintained and its activities are carried on under such appropriations as in the judgment of Congress are needed from year to year.\n The only legitimate object the Senate could have in ordering the investigation was to aid it in legislating, and we think the subject- matter was such that the presumption should be indulged that this was the real object. An express avowal of the object would have been better; but in view of the particular subject-matter was not indispensable. In the Chapman Case, where the resolution contained no avowal, this court pointed out that it plainly related to a subject-matter of which the Senate had jurisdiction, and said:\n'We cannot assume on this record that the action of the Senate was without a legitimate object;' and also that 'it was certainly not necessary that the resolutions should declare in advance what the Senate meditated doing when the investigation was concluded.' \n166 \nU.S. 669, 670\n, 17 S. Ct. 681.\n\n In People v. Keeler, 99 N. Y. 463, 2 N. E. 615, 52 Am. Rep. 49, where the Court of Appeals of New York sustained an investigation ordered by the House of Representatives of that state where the resolution contained no avowal, but disclosed that it definitely related to the administration of a public office the duties of which were subject to legislative regulation, the court said (pages 485, 487 (2 N. E. 627)):\n'Where public institutions under the control of the state are ordered to be investigated, it is generally with the view of some legislative action respecting them, and the same may be said in respect of public officers.'\n\n And again:\n'We are bound to presume that the action of the legislative body was with a legitimate object, if it is capable of being so construed, and we have no right to assume that the contrary was intended.' \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 179]\n\u00a0\n While we rest our conclusion respecting the object of the investigation on the grounds just stated, it is well to observe that this view of what was intended is not new, but was shown in the debate on the resolution.20\n\n Of course, our concern is with the substance of the resolution and not with any nice questions of propriety respecting its direct reference to the then Attorney General by name. The resolution, like the charges which prompted its adoption, related to the activities of the department while he was its supervising officer; and the reference to him by name served to designate the period to which the investigation was directed.\n We think the resolution and proceedings give no warrant for thinking the Senate was attempting or intending to try the Attorney General at its bar or before its committee for and crime or wrongdoing. Nor do we think \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 180]\n\u00a0\n it a valid objection to the investigation that it might possibly disclose crime or wrongdoing on his part.\n The second resolution-the one directing that the witness be attached- declares that his testimony is sought with the purpose of obtaining 'information necessary as a basis for such legislative and other action as the Senate may deem necessary and proper.' This avowal of contemplated legislation is in accord with what we think is the right interpretation of the earlier resolution directing the investigation. The suggested possibility of 'other action' if deemed 'necessary or proper' is, of course, open to criticism in that there is no other action in the matter which would be within the power of the Senate. But we do not assent to the view that this indenfinite and untenable suggestion invalidates the entire proceeding. The right view in our opinion is that it takes nothing from the lawful object avowed in the same resolution and rightly inferable from the earlier one. It is not as if an inadmissible or unlawful object were affirmatively and definitely avowed.\n We conclude that the investigation was ordered for a legitimate object; that the witness wrongfully refused to appear and testify before the committee and was lawfully attached; that the Senate is entitled to have him give testimony pertinent to the inquiry, either at its bar or before the committee; and that the district court erred in discharging him from custody under the attachment.\n Another question has arisen which should be noticed. It is whether the case has become moot. The investigation was ordered and the committee appointed during the Sixty-Eighth Congress. That Congress expired March 4, 1925. The resolution ordering the investigation in terms limited the committee's authority to the period of the Sixty-Eighth Congress; but this apparently was changed by a later and amendatory resolution authorizing the committee to sit at such times and places as it might \n\n[273 U.S. 135, 181]\n\u00a0\n deem advisable or necessary. \n21\n It is said in Jefferson's Manual:22\n'Neither house can continue any portion of itself in any parliamentary function beyond the end of the session without the consent of the other two branches. When done, it is by a bill constituting them commissioners for the particular purpose.'\n\n But the context shows that the reference is to the two houses of Parliament when adjourned by prorogration or dissolution by the king. The rule may be the same with the House of Representatives whose members are all elected for the period of a single Congress; but it cannot well be the same with the Senate, which is a continuing body whose members are elected for a term of six years and so divided into classes that the seats of one- third only become vacant at the end of each Congress, two-thirds always continuing into the next Congress, save as vacancies may occur through death or resignation.\n Mr. Hinds in his collection of precedents says:\n'The Senate, as a continuing body, may continue its committees through the recess following the expiration of a Congress.'23\n\n And, after quoting the above statement from Jefferson's Manuel, he says:\n'The Senate, however, being a continuing body, gives authority to its committees during the recess after the expiration of a Congress.'24\n\n So far as we are advised the select committee having this investigation in charge has neither made a final report nor been discharged; nor has it been continued by an affirmative order. Apparently its activities have been suspended pending the decision of this case. But, be this as it may, it is certain that the committee may be continued or revived now by motion to that effect, and, if continued or revived, will have all its original powers. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n[273 U.S. 135, 182]\n\u00a0\n This being so, and the Senate being a continuing body, the case cannot be said to have become moot in the ordinary sense. The situation is measurably like that in Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 498\n, 514-516, 31 S. Ct. 279, where it was held that a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission did not become moot through the expiration of the order, where it was capable of repetition by the commission and was a matter of public interest. Our judgment may yet be carried into effect, and the investigation proceeded with from the point at which it apparently was interrupted by reason of the habeas corpus proceedings. In these circumstances we think a judgment should be rendered as was done in the case cited.\n What has been said requires that the final order in the district court discharging the witness from custody be reversed.\n Final order reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rev.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 85\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Ransom H. Gillett, of Albany, N. Y., for McGuire. \n\n[273 U.S. 95, 96]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n McGuire was convicted in the District Court for northern New York of the crime of possessing intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/4 et seq.), 300 F. 98. On review of the judgment of conviction, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified to this court two questions concerning which it desires instructions. 6 F.(2d) 576; section 239, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216).\n The certificate states that before the filing of the information on which McGuire was convicted, a search warrant was issued by a United States commissioner com- \n\n[273 U.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n manding certain revenue agents to enter and search described premises for liquors alleged to be posessed by McGuire. The officers named, acting under the warrant, searched the premises, discovering several gallons of intoxicating liquor which they seized. While there, they destroyed without court order or other legal authority all the seized liquor, except one quart of whisky and one quart of alcohol, which they retained as evidence. On the trial the liquor retained was received in evidence over the objection that it was inadmissible because of the destruction of the other liquor. The questions certified are:\n'(1) Were the officers of the law by reason of their action in destroying the liquors seized trespassers ab initio?\n\n'If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, we ask\n\n'(2) Was the admission in evidence of the samples of liquor unlawful?'\n\n It is contended that the officers by destroying the seized liquor became trespassers ab initio; that they thus lost the protection and authority conferred upon them by the search warrant; that therefore the seizure of the liquor, both that destroyed and that retained as evidence, was illegal and prohibited by the Fourth Amendment; and that the reception of the liquor in evidence violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. This conclusion has received some support in judicial decisions. United States v. Cooper (D. C.) 295 F. 709; cf. Godat v. McCarthy (D. C.) 283 F. 689. But the weight of authority is against it. Hurley v. United States (C. C. A.) 300 F. 75 (overruling United States v. Cooper, supra); Giacolone v. United States (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 108; In re Quirk (D. C.) 1 F.(2d) 484; United States v. Clark (D. C.) 298 F. 533; People v. Schregardus, 226 Mich. 279, 197 N. W. 573. \n\n[273 U.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n That the destruction of the liquor by the officers was in itself an illegal and oppressive act is conceded. \n1\n But it does not follow that the seizure of the liquor which was retained violated constitutional immunities of the defendant or that the evidence was improperly received. The arguments advanced in behalf of the accused concern primarily the personal liability of the officers making the search and seizure for their unlawful destruction of a part of the liquor seized. They have at most a remote and artificial bearing upon the right of the government to introduce in evidence the liquor seized under a proper warrant.\n The doctrine of trespass ab initio, chiefly relied upon, is usually traced to the Case of the Six Carpenters, 8 Coke, 146(a). There in a civil action for trespass, the principle was announced that where one enters the premises of another under authority of law, his subsequent misconduct while there taints the entry from the beginning with illegality. See as to the origin of the rule, Commonwealth v. Rubin, 165 Mass. 453, 455, 43 N. E. 200. This fiction, obviously invoked in support of a policy of penalizing the unauthorized acts of those who had entered under authority of \n\n[273 U.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n law, has only been applied as a rule of liability in civil actions against them. Its extension is not favored. See Salmond, Law of Torts (5th Ed.)  54; Jeremiah Smith, Surviving Fictions, 27 Yale Law Journal, 147, 164 et seq. Thus it has been held to have no application in criminal actions against the trespasser. State v. Moore, 12 N. H. 42. Nor does the unlawful distraint or attachment of certain articles make unlawful the seizure of property otherwise rightfully taken at the same time. Harvey v. Pocock, 11 M. & W. 740; Wentworth v. Sawyer, 76 Me. 434, 441; Cone v. Forest, 126 Mass. 97, 101. Cf. Dod v. Monger, 6 Mod. 215.\n Even if the officers were liable as trespassers ab initio, which we do not decide, we are concerned here not with their liability but with the interest of the government in securing the benefit of the evidence seized, so far as may be possible without sacrifice of the immunities guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. A criminal prosecution is more than a game in which the government may be checkmated and the game lost merely because its officers have not played according to rule. The use by prosecuting officers of evidence illegally acquired by others does not necessarily violate the Constitution nor affect its admissibility. Cf. Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 574, 13 A. L. R. 1159; Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585\n, 24 S. Ct. 372; Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 398\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments protect every person from the invasion of his home by federal officials without a lawful warrant and from incrimination by evidence procured as a result of the invasion. Weeks v. United States, supra; Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S. Ct. 261; Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20\n, 46 S. Ct. 4; Amos v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 313\n, 41 S. Ct. 266. Cf. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n, 40 S. Ct. 182. Here there was no such invasion. The seizure of the liquor received in evidence was in fact distinct from the destruction of the rest. Its validity so far as the government is con- \n\n[273 U.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n cerned should be equally distinct. We can impute to the one the illegality of the other only by resorting to a fiction whose origin, history, and purpose do not justify its application where the right of the government to make use of evidence is involved.\n It follows that neither the seizure of this liquor nor its use as evidence infringed any constitutional immunity of the accused. In this view of the case, the answer to the second question in the certificate is not dependent upon the answer to the first which pertains to the personal liability of the officers. Interpreting the second question as an inquiry whether the samples of intoxicating liquor should have been excluded as evidence, the answer is:\n No.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 25 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 m), provides for the issuance of search warrants pursuant to the requirements of title 11 of the Espionage Act June 15, 1917, c. 30 (40 Stat. 228-230 (Comp. St.  10496 1\/4 a et seq.)), and that seized property 'be subject to such disposition as the court may make thereof.' The Espionage Act regulates the issuance, execution, and return of warrants. If the grounds on which the warrant was issued be controverted, a hearing before a judge or commissioner must be held (section 15 (Comp. St.  10496 1\/4 o)), and the property returned, if erroneously taken. But if the warrant properly issued and the property seized was that described in the warrant, 'then the judge or commissioner shall order the same retained in the custody of the person seizing it or to be otherwise disposed of according to law' (section 16 (section 10496 1\/4 p)). 'An officer who in executing a search warrant wilfully exceeds his authority, or exercises it with unnecessary severity, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year.'

Ogden, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Nathan Ballin, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The record presents a preliminary question as to our jurisdiction under the writ of error.\n The writ is brought to review a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, which affirmed, without opinion, a judgment rendered at Trial Term against the plaintiff in error, as Agent designated by the President under the Transportation Act of 1920 (49 USCA  74; Comp. St.  10071 1\/4 cc). O'Neill v. Davis, 215 App. Div. 766, 213 N. Y. S. 871. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals was denied both by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals; and the judgment of the Appellate Division thereby became the final decision of the highest court of the State in which a decision could be had.\n This judgment was entered after the Jurisdictional Act of 19251 took effect. The only error assigned here \n\n[275 U.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n that presents a ground for the writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended by section 1 of this Act (28 USCA  344; Comp. St .  1214),2 is that the provisions of the New York Civil Practice Act relating to the amendment of process and substitution of parties, as applied in allowing the substitution of the predecessor of the plaintiff in error as the party defendant, are invalid because of repugnancy to the laws of the United States.\n The record, however, does not show that this question was either presented to or passed upon by the Appellate Division. No reference to the Practice Act or challenge to its validity appears in the proceedings either at Trial Term or in the Appellate Division. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n It has long been settled that this Court acquires no jurisdiction to review the judgment of a state court of last resort on writ of error, unless it affirmatively appears upon the face of the record that a federal question constituting an appropriate ground for such review was presented in and expressly or necessarily decided by such state court. Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 360\n, 47 S. Ct. 641; \n\n[275 U.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n and cases cited, It is not enough that there may be somewhere hidden in the record a question which if it had been raised would have been of a federal nature. Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193, 199\n, 19 S. Ct. 379; Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, \n175 \nU.S. 626, 634\n, 20 S. Ct. 205; Whitney v. California, supra, 362 (47 S. Ct. 641).\n For these reasons the writ of error must be dismissed. And, regarding the writ, under the Jurisdictional Act, as a petition for certiorari, it is denied.\n Writ of error dismissed for want of jurisdiction; certiorari denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 43 Stat. 936, c. 229, printed as an Appendix to the Revised Rules of this Court, \n266 U.S. 687\n. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, as thus amended, now provides that: 'A final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, and the decision is against its validity; or where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any State, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court upon a writ of error.' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In this respect the present case is essentially different from Davis v. Cohen Co., \n268 \nU.S. 638, 640\n, 45 S.

In the bonds secured the district expressly covenants that in case of default there shall be paid to the trustee out of the proceeds of the assessments pledged, 'and before the payment of the interest and principal of said bonds, a reasonable compensation to the trustee and to such counsel as the trustee may find it necessary to employ.' This plainly means a payment out of the assessments over and above the payment to the bondholders, if the words are to receive a natural interpretation and are not required by the statute to be read in a different sense.\n The act creating the road district, approved January 30, 1920, after indicating the highway to be laid out orders an assessment of benefits ( section 6), and the laying of a tax to pay the costs, not exceeding the value of the benefits assessed (sections 8-10), the collector receiving a commission (section 9), and empowers the board of commissioners of the district 'to make all such contracts in the prosecution of the work as may best subserve the public interest' (section 12). Then by section 13, 'in order to do the work,' the board is authorized to borrow money, to issue negotiable bonds for the sum, and to 'pledge and mortgage all assessments for the repay- \n\n[275 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n ment thereof.' As said by the petitioner, a trustee obviously is necessary for a mortgage to secure bonds that are expected to go into many hands, and, if a foreclosure is required, a lawyer must be employed. The statute must be taken to contemplate and authorize these usual incidents of the mortgage that it invites. It cannot have expected the services to be gratuitous, and there is no reason why the cost should not be borne by those who made them requisite. It is said that the assessment is a public fund not to be applied except as its creation provides. A pretty ignoble immunity has been secured at times on that argument, but it should not be allowed to work more injustice than is inevitable. As we have said, the implications of the statute are as the petitioner contends, and the general rule of equity is stated with such force in Dodge v. Tulleys, \n144 \nU.S. 451\n, 12 S. Ct. 728, as to suggest a doubt whether a state could deprive the courts of the United States of their power to impose these costs. We find nothing in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Arkansas that leads us to believe that that court would read the statute as attempting to prevent the costs being allowed. See Arkansas Foundry Co. v. Stanley, 150 Ark. 127, 136, 233 S. W. 922.\n It is to be observed that the fund got by the assessment was not exhausted by the payment of the bonds, so that no question arises on that score. Nor does it seem to us that the district can get immunity from the words of section 20 forbidding the board to use any money arising from the sale of the bonds for any purpose other than therein specified and expressly directed. For, without stopping to quibble over the fact that the money in question comes from the assessment rather than from the sale of the bonds, except to note that the section has a different aim, it is enough that, if we are right, the proposed use of the money is expressly authorized, as a necessary incident of the mortgage provided for in section 13. In other places the \n\n[275 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n statute contemplates payment for necessary services; we cannot believe that it does not contemplate a similar payment here.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERRITT & CHAPMAN DERRICK & WRECKING CO. v.

McManus, all of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. George R. Farnum, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error sued under the Tucker Act, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, upon a claim for salvage on account of service alleged to have been rendered the steamship Leviathan, owned by the defendant in error. United States v. Cornell Steamboat Co., \n202 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 26 S. Ct. 648. On defendant's motion the court, May 7, 1925, dismissed the petition on the ground that it fails to state a cause of action. The case is here on writ of error to that court. J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 458\n, 39 S. Ct. 158.\n The petition alleges the following: August 24-25, 1921, at Hoboken, there was a fierce and extensive fire on \n\n[274 U.S. 611, 612]\n\u00a0\n Pier 5. The Leviathan lay bow in at the south side of Pier 4. She could not be towed out. She had only a skeleton crew, and it would have required a large number to man her and many hours of preparation to get up sufficient steam and move her by means of her own engines. The fire started at half after 6 in the evening and was not extinguished until 7 in the morning. A part of the time it covered the whole length of Pier 5, the bulkhead, and adjacent houses. The wind was from the south, and tended to carry the fire across the slip and onto the Leviathan. Her port side as considerably scorched, and several times fire broke out on her superstructure. Ammunition was stored in a building near the bulkhead, and the possibility of an explosion added to the danger. Plaintiff's steamers Commissioner and Chapman Brothers were powerful boats, specially built, equipped, and manned for salvage and fire-fighting service. The former from 7 until half after 9 in the evening, and the latter from about 7 in the evening until 7 in the morning, continuously fought the fire. They played heavy streams of water on the burning pier, where the fire threatened the Leviathan. And, by way of conclusion, it is stated that:\n'The service was a direct aid and benefit to the steamer Leviathan in preventing the spread of flames from Pier 5 to that vessel, and had it not been for the said service great damage to, if not total loss of, the said steamship would have resulted.'\n\n Limiting the general statement by the specific, in accordance with the context (United States v. Union Pacific R. Co. (C. C. A.) 169 F. 65, 67, and cases cited), the substance of the allegation is that plaintiff in error, by preventing the spread of the fire from the pier to the Leviathan, rendered her direct aid and benefit.\n There is no claim that the Leviathan, or any one in her behalf, requested or accepted assistance from plaintiff in \n\n[274 U.S. 611, 613]\n\u00a0\n error, or that its fireboats played any water on that vessel, or did anything to extinguish fire thereon, or to give her any assistance, other than that involved in fighting the fire on and about Pier 5. The distance between and Leviathan and that fire is not stated, and there is nothing to indicate that she did not have adequate protection from other sources. Indeed, the circumstances disclosed by the petition rather tend to show that she did not need any assistance from plaintiff in error.\n While salvage cannot be exacted for assistance forced upon a ship ( The Bolivar v. The Chalmette, Fed. Cas. No. 1,611, 1 Woods, 397), her request for or express acceptance of the service is not always essential to the validity of the claim. It is enough if, under the circumstances, any prudent man would have accepted. The Annapolis, In the Privy Council, Lushington, 355, 375. Plaintiff in error claims as a volunteer salvor, going at his own risk to the assistance of the ship on the change of reward in case of success, and not as one employed rendering service for pay according to his effort or the terms of his contract. The Sabine, \n101 U.S. 384\n, 390. It did not communicate with or enter into the service of the Leviathan. Its fireboats did not put water upon her. The fires that started on her were put out by other means. All effort of plaintiff in error was put forth directly for the purpose of extinguishing fire at and about Pier 5, and to save property not at all related to the Leviathan. The elimination of that fire contributed mediately to her safety. But, whatever the aid or benefit resulting to her, it was incidental and indirect for which, in the absence of request for or acceptance of the service, a claim for salvage cannot be sustained.

FOUNDATION CO.(1927)\nNo. 202\nArgued: March 9, 1927Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claude L. Johnson and J. F. Pierson, both of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. Purnell M. Milner, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On December 20, 1920, Robert L. Messel filed a suit in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans, state of Louisiana, to recover $ 10,000 for damages for personal injuries from the Foundation Company, a corporation of the state of New York doing business in Louisiana as a shipbuilder and repairer of sea-going steamships. The facts as averred in his petition were as follows:\n He was employed by the Foundation Company in \n\n[274 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n September, 1919, as a helper to a boilermaker. He was sent with the boilermaker on board the steamship La Grange, then afloat on the Mississippi river at New Orleans. The task to be performed was to add 8 feet to the smokestack of the steamer. The two men were furnished ladders to ascend to the top of the stack and while engaged in the work Messel was brought directly over the mouth of the steam escape pipe running from the engine room. While he was so engaged, scalding steam was allowed to escape from the pipe. It overcame him, and inflicted serious injuries.\n The fourteenth paragraph of his petition is:\n'Petitioner represents that he is entitled to claim and recover under Civil Code, art. 2315, of this state all the damages sustained by him arising from the casualties aforesaid, ... and not by the Workmen's Compensation Act of that state, known as Act No. 20 of 1914, and its amendments.'\n\n In his petition he attacks the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Act, known as Act No. 20 of 1914, as invalid under the state Constitution. He says that when injured he was engaged in marine work in admiralty on the steamship on the navigable waters of the United States, and that this entitled him to an action in personam against the owner and master of the vessel, but that, as the owner and master had departed from the port for a foreign port before he was able to bring his action in admiralty, and as the Foundation Company holds indemnity against any loss to it on account of the damage claimed, he prays for judgment against his employer.\n The Foundation Company excepted to the petition on the ground that it disclosed no legal cause of action, but, in the event that the exception should be overruled, the \n\n[274 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n company admitted the averments of the petition, save that it charged that the petitioner was guilty of gross negligence, and assumed the risk, and that the injuries received were due to his own fault or were caused by the negligence of a fellow servant. It denied the extent of the damage; said that the petitioner was precluded from bringing his action under article 2315 of the Civil Code, but must bring it under the state Workmen's Compensation Act.\n Messel amended his petition, reaffirming the averments of his original petition but in the alternative asked, if it should be held that the Workmen's Compensation Act of Louisiana was not unconstitutional and did apply, that he have compensation under that act in $4,000, or in $10 a week for 400 weeks provided in the act. This amendment was filed May 22, 1922, by order of court. An exception by respondent was taken on the ground that the amended petition had changed the issue and was an attempt, after the lapse of more than one year from the date of the injuries, to bring the suit under the Workmen's Compensation Act, while the original action was brought under Civil Code, art. 2315, for damages for a tort, that the claim was therefore prescribed under article 31 of Act No. 20 of 1914. By a judgment of July 19, 1922, the exceptions filed by the Foundation Company were sustained and the suit against it was dismissed.\n The Court of Appeal of the Parish of Orleans, to which the case was then taken on appeal, held that the objections to the constitutionality of the Workmen's Compensation Act could not be sustained. It further decided that, if the petitioner's right of action was not under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the state courts had no jurisdiction of such demands ratione materiae; that it had twice decided that the state court was without Workmen's Compensation Act, where the Workmenhs Compensation Act, where the plaintiffs sustained injuries while aboard a ship under a maritime contract; that these decisions were in accord with the opinion of the Supreme \n\n[274 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n Court of Louisiana in Lawson v. New York & P. R. Steamship Co., 148 La. 290, 86 So. 815, and with the decisions of this court in Southern Pacific v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 206\n, 37 S. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, affirmed in Knickerbocker v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, and State v. Dawson, \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302, and in Peters v. Veasey, \n251 \nU.S. 121\n, 40 S. Ct. 65; and that an employee like Messel, who suffered injury upon a vessel under a maritime contract of employment, could not obtain compensation in a state court of Louisiana.\n Application was then made to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for a writ of certiorari to review the decree of dismissal by the Court of Appeal. The writ was refused by the Supreme Court, on the ground that the judgment was correct, May 25, 1925\n\n\n Article 2315 of the Revised Code of Louisiana, under which Messel sought recovery is as follows:\n'Every act whatever of man that causes damage to another, obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.'\n\n The Workmen's Compensation Act, No. 20 of the Acts of 1914, as amended in subsequent acts, provides for the prosecution of claims for personal injuries in certain hazardous trades, businesses and occupations, includes the operation, construction, repair, removal, maintenance and demolition of vessels, boats and other water craft, and provides certain payments for such injuries. Section 34 of the act provides that the rights and remedies therein granted to an employee on account of personal injury, for which he is entitled to compensation under the act, shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representative, dependents, relations, or otherwise, on account of such injury.\n The argument of the Court of Appeal in reaching its conclusion in this case was that because it had been held in Peters v. Veasey; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, and in State v. Dawson, that a Workmen's Compensation Act could have no application to an injury to one working as an employee on a vessel afloat on the waters of the United States, \n\n[274 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n where his work was upon a maritime contract, and the rights and liabilities of the parties were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction, a state court had no power to consider and decide a claim that must rest on the maritime law, because the Workmen's Compensation Act was made exclusive by its terms and prevented the operation and application of section 2315 granting what was equivalent to a common-law remedy in the enforcement of such a maritime claim. At first this decision would seem to be conclusive upon us, because it would seem to be a construction by the Louisiana state court of the jurisdiction conferred by its own statute upon its own courts. But this is a misconception of what the court actually decided in respect to the statute. The Workmen's Compensation Act did not by its terms include a maritime injury or tort under the federal law, such as is the basis of this suit. The state court's ruling, as we conceive it, was not that section 2315 was not broad enough to include a suit for a maritime tort as between master and servant, if the federal law permitted it, but that the federal law does not permit it, and therefore such a suit can only be maintained in a federal admiralty court. That is an erroneous view of the rulings of our court as to the application of Workmen's Compensation Acts. Section 2315 offers a remedy in the state court for any act whatever of man that causes damage to another and obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it. That includes everything except what the Workmen's Compensation Act bars from recovery under this general section. The Workmen's Compensation Act does not bar from recovery suit for damages against another for a maritime tort. Clearly, therefore, suit for such a tort is not excluded from the jurisdiction of the state court under section 2315 unless the federal law forbids. To hold that the federal law forbids would be to deprive the petitioner in This case of the right secured to him under Judiciary Act 1789,  9, as now contained \n\n[274 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n in paragraph third of section 256 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1233), which gives exclusive jurisdiction in courts of the United States of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, 'saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.'\n Section 2315 has been held by the Supreme Court of Louisiana to furnish the equivalent of the common law. In Gray v. New Orleans Dry Dock & Shipping Co., 146 La. 826, 84 So. 109, a case very much like this, a workman was injured while engaged in maritime employment. His action invoked article 2315 of the Civil Code. The respondent in the case pleaded that the petitioner's right of action, if any, was governed by the Workmen's Compensation Act, No. 20 of 1914, and not by the provisions of article 2315 of the Revised Civil Code of Louisiana, as pleaded by the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court of Louisiana said:\n'The work in which plaintiff was engaged at the time he was injured was maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract, and his claim for damages was enforceable in the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. For that reason, before the passage of the Act of Congress of October 6, 1917 (U. S. Comp. St.  991(3), 1233), the Employers' Liability Act was not pertinent, and did not deprive the plaintiff of the right of a common-law remedy. We say 'common-law,' because article 2315 of the Civil Code of this state is only an embodiment of the common-law right of action for tort, viz.: 'Every act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.\"\n\n The fact that Messel, in the alternative, asked for a recovery under the Workmen's Compensation Act, could not defeat him in his continuous request to proceed under article 2315, and as the original action invoked article 2315, and he is still invoking the remedy provided by that article, there would seem to be no opportunity for the \n\n[274 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n operation of the prescription of one year provided by the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Act. Messel's attack upon the Workmen's Compensation Act as unconstitutional under the Constitution of Louisiana was entirely irrelevant and should be rejected as surplusage.\n As Messel has resorted to the state court, and there is nothing to prevent his recovery in the state court except the Workmen's Compensation Act, which is inapplicable to his case, in view of our decisions, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana must be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n The principles applicable to Messel's recovery, should he have one, must be limited to those which the admiralty law of the United States prescribes, including the applicable section of the federal Employers' Liability Act, incorporated in the maritime law by section 33, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988, 1007 (Comp. St.  8337a); Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Dahl, \n266 \nU.S. 449\n, 45 S. Ct. 157; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479, 480\n, 43 S. Ct. 418; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v.

Schutz, of Milwaukee, Wis., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Walter J. Mattison and John M. Niven, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for defendant in error. \n\n[272 U.S. 713, 714]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of taxes alleged to have been unconstitutionally exacted from the plaintiffs' testator. The facts are agreed and the only question is the validity of the tax under the Constitution of the United States. The testator held stock in Wisconsin corporations that owned United States bonds issued under the Acts of April 24 and September 24, 1917 (Comp. St.  6829ee et seq.). The interest upon these bonds was credited by the corporations to their surplus, and subsequently was distributed to the stockholders in dividends of stock or cash. The corporations paid a tax upon their income, except, of course, upon that received from the bonds of the United States. But this exemption was met in the laws of Wisconsin by a provision that while the stockholders were not taxed upon dividends received from corporations the income of which was assessed, yet if only part of the income of the corporation was assessed, only a corresponding part of the dividends or income received therefrom should be deducted from the income taxed to the stockholders. The law also provides that taxable income shall include all dividends from the earnings of corporations, whether in cash or stock. The testator was taxed in accordance with the statute, against his protest that the attempt to make up from him what the State could not take from the corporations was forbidden by the Constitution and laws of the United States. The District Court ruled that the action could not be maintained and the case was brought directly to this Court.\n There is no doubt that in general a corporation is a nonconductor that cuts off connection between dividends to its stockholders and the corporate funds from which the dividends are paid. Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103\n, 44 S. Ct. 23. A system of taxation that applied to stockholders of all corporations equally might tax, we assume for purposes of argument, the stockhold- \n\n[272 U.S. 713, 715]\n\u00a0\n ers of a corporation that had invested all its property in United States bonds. But it would be a different matter if the State selected such corporations, supposing a number of them to exist, and taxed their stockholders alone. It is a familiar principle that conduct which in usual situations the law protects may become unlawful when part of a scheme to reach a prohibited result. If the avowed purpose or self-evident operation of a statute is to follow the bonds of the United States and to make up for its inability to reach them directly by indirectly achieving the same result, the statute must fail even if but for its purpose or special operation it would be perfectly good. Under the laws of Wisconsin the income from the United States bonds may not be the only item exempted from the income tax on corporations, but it certainly is the most conspicuous instance of exemption at the present time. A result intelligently foreseen and offering the most obvious motive for an act that will bring it about, fairly may be taken to have been a purpose of the act. On that assumption the immunity of the national bonds is too important to allow any narrowing beyond what the Acts of Congress permit. We think it would be going too far to say that they allow an intentional interference that is only prevented from being direct by the artificial distinction between a corporation and its members. A tax very well may be upheld as against any casual effect it may have upon the bonds of the United States when passed with a different intent and not aimed at them, but it becomes a more serious attack upon their immunity when they are its obvious aim. In such a case the Court must consider the public welfare rather than the artifices contrived for private convenience and must look at the facts. See Home Insurance Co. of New York v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 598\n, 10 S. Ct. 593; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S. Ct. 171; United States Grain Corporation v. Phillips, \n261 \nU.S. 106, 113\n, 43 S. Ct. 283.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n[272 U.S. 713, 716]\n\u00a0\n By agreement, the decision in this case controls the decision in No. 74, Chas. A. Miller et al. v. City of Milwaukee; No. 75, Emil P. Miller v. City of Milwaukee; and No. 76, Harry G. John v. City of Milwaukee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring).\n I agree that the judgment must be reversed, but on a different ground. It was stipulated before the state board, which upheld the tax, that it was levied upon 'that portion of the mentioned dividends which were directly declared from interest accruing from United States bonds issued under and by virtue of the Acts of Congress passed April 24, 1917 and September 24, 1917.' A similar stipulation was entered into in the court below, Thus the dividends were earmarked as the direct proceeds of the interest on the war bonds. The later act (Comp. St.  6829ll) provided, in terms, the former in substance, that the bonds 'shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by ... any state, ... upon the income or profits of individuals, partnerships, associations or corporations.' The provision creating the exemption was clearly within the power of Congress 'to borrow money on the credit of the United States' (article 1,  8, par. 2), and was also within its war powers. As a matter of statutory construction, a dividend paid directly from the interest seems to me within the exemption expressly conferred. The tax levied was, therefore, void because it violated that exemption.\n I do not think it can properly be said that the state statute discriminates against government bonds. The statute makes no reference to them or to any particular class of securities. The tax imposed upon the stockholder results, not from discrimination practiced by a state against the federal government, but from the fact that the corporation happened to earn its dividend from securities on which, under the Wisconsin law, it was not required \n\n[272 U.S. 713, 717]\n\u00a0\n to pay a tax. Compare State ex rel. Columbia Construction Co. v. Tax Commission, 166 Wis. 369, 165 N. W. 382. The operation and effect of the statute would be precisely the same if the dividend had been paid out of any other corporate income exempt from the state tax; from interest upon other tax exempt bonds, if any; or out of income from the part of a business carried on in another state, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; State ex rel. Arpin v. Eberhardt, 158 Wis. 20, 147 N. W. 1016; Van Dyke v. Milwaukee, 159 Wis. 460, 466, 146 N. W. 812, 150 N. W. 509; or out of rentals or mine royalties received from land without the state, or out of profits received from the sale of property having a situs out of the state, Wisconsin Statutes,  71.02, subd. 3 (see State ex rel. Mariner v. Hampel, 172 Wis. 67, 178 N. W. 244); or out of dividends received from banks, Wisconsin Statutes,  71.05, subd. 1(e).\n The purpose of the Legislature was solely to prevent double taxation by the state of Wisconsin, of the income received by individuals in the form of dividends. The deduction allowed is limited to that necessary to prevent double taxation. Under the Wisconsin law as originally enacted in 1911 (Laws 1911, c. 658), the individual was allowed to deduct from the aggregate income on which the tax was payable all 'dividends or incomes received ... from stocks, or interest in any ... corporation, ... the income of which shall have been assessed under the provisions of this act.' The proviso here in question, namely, 'that when only part of the income of any ... corporation, ... shall have been assessed under this act only a corresponding part of the dividends or income received therefrom shall be deducted,' was added in 1913 (Laws 1913, c. 720) four years before the United States entered the World War. At that time there were substantially no government bonds outstanding except those used by national banks as the basis for note issues. And in view of the exemptions enumerated above, it cannot well be said, even after the war, that the tax upon dividends paid out of interest on United \n\n[272 U.S. 713, 718]\n\u00a0\n States bonds furnishes the most conspicuous instance of the operation of the section in question.\n Moreover, under the Wisconsin law, the source out of which the dividend was declared is immaterial.

CITY OF JACKSON(1927)\nNo. 14\nArgued: October 13, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Scott and Robert H. Thompson, both of Jackson, Miss., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Garner W. Green and William H. Watkins, both of Jackson, Miss ., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Millsaps College is an educational institution, not operated for profit. It was incorporated by a special act of the \n\n[275 U.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n Mississippi Legislature approved February 21, 1890 (Laws 1890, c. 379) which contains, among others, the following provisions:\n The incorporators and their successors, under the name of Millsaps College, 'may accept donations of real and personal property for the benefit of the college hereafter to be established by them, and contributions of money or negotiable securities of every kind, in aid of the endowment of such college.'\n'Said corporation shall have the power to select any appropriate town, city or other place in this state, at which to establish said college and to purchase grounds, not to exceed one hundred acres, as a building site and campus therefor, and erect thereon such buildings, dormitories, and halls as they may think expedient and proper, to subserve the purposes of their organization, and the best interest of said institution, and they may invite propositions from any city, or town, or individual in this state for such grounds, and may accept donations or grants of land for the site of said institution.'\n\n'That the lands or grounds, not to exceed one hundred acres, used by the corporation as a site and campus for said college, and the buildings, halls, dormitories there erected, and the endowment fund contributed to said college, shall be exempt from all state, county and municipal taxation, so long as the said college shall be kept open and be maintained for the purposes contemplated by this act, and no longer.'\n\n Two improved pieces of land on Capitol street, in the city of Jackson, were donated to the corporation, as recited by the deeds of conveyance, 'in consideration of the aid thereby to be given to the endowment of Millsaps College.' They constitute no part of the 'building site and campus' and are carried on the productive endowment account at proper valuations. The buildings are rented \n\n[275 U.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n and the revenue derived therefrom is used to defray operating expenses of the college and for no other purposes.\n The city assessed the lots and buildings for taxation. By the present proceeding the college seeks to vacate the assessment. It asserts exemption of the property by the act of 1890 and claims that the later general taxing act, if applied thereto, would impair the obligation of the contract contrary to section 10, article 1, federal Constitution.\n The Supreme Court of Mississippi said (136 Miss. 195, 101 So. 574):\n'The exemption from taxation granted the college covers two classes of property: First, the lands or grounds, not to exceed one hundred acres, used by the corporation as a site and campus for said college, and the buildings, halls, and dormitories thereon erected; and, second, the endowment fund contributed to said college. It is admitted by counsel for the appellant, and the fact is, that the land here in controversy is not included in the first of these classes; consequently the narrow question presented for decision is: Does the exemption include land held by the college as a part of its endowment?\n\n'The endowment of a college is commonly understood as including all property, real or personal, given to if for its permanent support. If the terms is to be so defined here, then practically all of the land which the corporation can hold 'for the benefit of the college' will be exempt, for all of such property must necessarily be of one of two classes: First, the campus and grounds on which the college buildings are situated; or, second, land the revenue from which is applied to the support of the college, or, in other words, land held as a part of its endowment.\n\n'It seems reasonably clear that the term 'endowment fund' is here used in a more restricted sense and was not intended to include land, for the specific grant of an \n\n[275 U.S. 129, 132]\n\u00a0\n exemption on land of a certain character negatives by implication an intention to exempt land of a different character.'\n\n And the court accordingly concluded that the statutory exemption in respect of real estate was intended to extend only 'to the lands for grounds, not to exceed one hundred acres, used by the corporation as a site and campus for said college, and the buildings, halls and dormitories thereon erected.'\n The jurisdiction of this court is questioned. But the validity of the general taxing act of the state, said to be subsequent to the incorporation, was challenged below upon the ground that if construed to subject the lots in question to taxation, it would impair the obligation of the contract, and under section 344, title 28, U. S. C. (28 USCA  344; Comp. St.  1214), the cause is subject to review here.\n While in cases like this 'we form our own judgment as to the existence and construction of the alleged contract, and are not concluded by the construction which the state court has placed on the statute that forms such contract, yet we give to that construction the most respectful consideration and it will in general be followed, unless it seems to be plainly erroneous.' Also, we think, the rule as to the construction of statutes of exemption from taxation should be applied, and where there is room for reasonable doubt as to total or only partial exemption, the latter alone should be recognized. Great weight attaches to the decision of a state court regarding questions of taxation or exemption therefrom under the constitution or laws of its own state. Jetton v.

Kinsworthy and Robert E. Wiley, both of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. C. Marshall, of Little Rock, Ark., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 21, 1920, at Earle, Arkansas, defendants in error delivered to plaintiff in error 75 bales of cotton for transportation to Liverpool, England. The carrier issued to the shippers an export bill of lading in two parts. The first covered the inland haul from Earle to Brunswick, Ga., designated as port A, and the second covered the ocean carriage from Brunswick to Liverpool, designated as port B. The inland route specified was over the lines of railroad of plaintiff in error, the Mobile & Ohio, and the Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic. The inland rate for the railraods named was 98.5 cents per 100 pounds. The ocean transportation was to be by the Leyland Line for the rate of $1.95. The bill of lading contained, as applicable in respect of the service and delivery at Brunswick, a provision that:\n'No carrier or party in possession of ... the property, herein described, shall be liable for any loss therof ... by fire. ...'\n\n After the bill of lading was issued, while the cotton was on the cars of the carrier and before they were moved from Earle, it was destroyed by a fire originating at the compress and which was not set by plaintiff in error. Sections 843 and 844, Crawford & Moses' Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas, declare that it is unlawful for any railroad to enter into an agreement with any shipper for the purpose of limiting or abrogating its statutory and common-law duties or liability as a common carrier; that all agreements made for that purpose and any rule or regulation limiting the common-law rights of shippers are void. Defendants in error brought this \n\n[273 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n action in the circuit court of Pulaski county, Ark., to recover the value of the cotton. Plaintiff in error contended-as it here insists-that these provisions of the Arkansas statute do not apply to the shipment in question, and that, if held to be applicable, they contravene the laws of the United States regulating interstate and foreign commerce. The circuit court applied the statute, and gave judgment for the shippers. The carrier took the case to the Supreme Court of the state, and there it was held that the acts of Congress regulating bills of lading apply only to interstate commerce and to shipments from a point in the United States to an adjacent foreign country, and do not evince an intention to regulate bills of lading for shipments from a point in the United States to nonadjacent foreign countires. 168 Ark. 22, 269 S. W. 47. The case is here on writ of error allowed by the chief justice of that court. Section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n There is no claim that the loss was caused by any fault or negligence of the carrier, and, if the Arkansas statute does not apply to the shipment, the clause in the bill of lading exempting the carrier from liability is valid. Cau v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 427\n, 24 S. Ct. 663. The power of Congress under the commerce clause to regulate bills of lading in respect of such shipments is not questioned; and, if it has entered the field of such regulation, the state statute is thereby superseded. The Interstate Commerce Act extends to the plaintiff in error and to the other railroads named in the bill of lading over which the cotton was to have been transported from Earle, Ark., to the port of Brunswick, Ga., and it also extends to the interstate transportation over the inland route constituting a part of the movement in foreign commerce. Section 1(1), (2) and (3), 41 Stat. 474 (Comp. St.  8563). Among other things, the act requires all carriers subject to it to establish and enforce just and reasonable regulations affecting the issuance, form and \n\n[273 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n substance of bills of lading. Section 1, (6), 41 Stat. 475. It directs the Interstate Commerce Commission to keep informed as to the manner and method in which the business of carriers is conducted and 'to execute and enforce the provisions of' the act. Section 12, 25 Stat. 858 (Comp. St.  8576). It provides that whenever, after hearing, the commission shall be of opinion that any 'regulation or practice whatsoever' of the carriers is unjust or unreasonable it may determine and prescribe what is just, fair and reasonable; and may make an order requiring the carriers to observe the regulation or practice prescribed. Section 15, 41 Stat. 484 (Comp. St .  8583). The act requires a carrier receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state or from a point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country to issue bills of lading therefor, and, to some extent, it regulates their provisions affecting the liability of carriers. Section 20( 11)-Carmack and Cummins Amendments, 38 Stat. 1197 (Comp. St.  8604a). Section 25, added by the amendment of February 28, 1920, 41 Stat. 497,  441 (Comp. St.  8596a), was enacted to promote the business of common carriers by water in foreign commerce whose vessels are registered under the laws of the United States; it applies to shipments from points in the United States to nonadjacent foreign countries and requires the commission to do certain things in furtherance and regulation thereof. Subdivision 4 of that section requires a railroad carrier receiving a shipment to be delivered to such a vessel for further transportation to issue a through bill of lading which shall state separately the amount to be paid for railroad transportation, for water transportation and in addition, if any, for port charges. It requires the railroad as a part of its undertaking to deliver the shipment to the vessel and provides that it will not be liable after such delivery. The commission is expressly empowered, in such manner as will preserve for the carrier by water the protection of limited liability provided by law, to pre- \n\n[273 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n scribe the form of such bills of lading. The section does not apply to shipments in such commerce where the ocean carriage is by a foreign vessel. The record does not disclose whether the vessel on which the cotton was to have been carried was registered under the laws of the United States; and, in favor of the shippers, we assume it was a foreign vessel.\n The question is whether Congress has entered upon the regulation of provisions in bills of lading affecting liability of railroads for loss of property received by them for transportation over an interstate inland route to a seaport for delivery to a foreign vessel for ocean carriage to a nonadjacent foreign country. All of the provisions referred to were in force when the cotton was delivered to plaintiff in error. No act of Congress or order of the commission prescribed a form of bill of lading for this shipment. Cf. In the Matter of Bills of Lading, 64 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 347, et seq.; Alaska S. S. Co. v. United States (D. C.) 259 F. 713; United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113\n, 40 S. Ct. 448. The defendants in error rightly say that the Carmack Amendment, the Cummins Amendment, or section 25 does not apply to such a shipment. But that does not sustain their contention that Congress has not evinced an intention to regulate bills of lading for transportation such as is here involved. Section 1(6) extends to all carriers and to all transportation subject to the act; it prescribes a general rule applicable to all regulations and practices affecting the form or substance of bills of lading in order that they may be just and reasonable. And the commission is empowered and directed to enforce the rule.\n The general regulation of the 'issuance, form, and substance' of bills of lading is broad enough to cover contractual provisions, like the one involved in this case, exempting railroads from liability for loss of shippers' property by fire. Congress must be deemed to have determined that the rule laid down and the means provided \n\n[273 U.S. 341, 346]\n\u00a0\n to enforce it are sufficient and that no other regulation is necessary. Its power to regulate such commerce and all its instrumentalities is supreme; and, as that power has been exerted, state laws have no application. They cannot be applied in coincidence with, as complementary to or as in opposition to, federal enactments which disclose the intention of Congress to enter a field of regulation that is within its jurisdiction.

DUBY(1927)\nNo. 372\nArgued: Decided: April 18, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 135, 136]\n\u00a0\n W. R. Crawford and Edwin C. Ewing, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellants.\n I. H. Van Winkle and J. M. Devers, both of Salem, Or., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 135, 139]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiffs below, the appellants here, owned and operated for hire, under proper license, motor trucks on the Columbia River Highway in Oregon, from the east boundary of Multnomah county to the west limits of the city of Hood River, a distance of 22.11 miles. This highway extends from Portland to The Dalles, Oregon, and is a rural post road. The plaintiffs have complied with all the state rules and regulations respecting the operation of motor trucks upon the highway, and under previous regulations carried a combined maximum load of not exceeding 22, 000 pounds. The highway commission under a law of Oregon has reduced the maximum to 16,500 pounds by an order, in which the commission recites that the road is being damaged by heavier loads. The plaintiffs filed this bill to enjoin the enforcement of the order, on the ground that it invades their federal constitutional rights.\n The case was heard under section 166 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, before a court of three judges, on an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue restraining the commission from enforcing the order. A \n\n[274 U.S. 135, 140]\n\u00a0\n motion to dismiss was interposed to the complaint by the defendant and submitted at the same time. The District Court denied the application for a preliminary injunction, and granted the motion to dismiss the plaintiff's amended bill, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or to entitle the plaintiffs to the relief demanded. As the plaintiffs refused to plead further, the cause was dismissed, and the case comes here directly from the District Court by virtue of paragraph 3 of section 238 of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936 (Comp. St.  1215).\n The Secretary of Agriculture, by virtue of three Acts of Congress, one of July 11, 1916, 39 Stat. 355, c. 241, an amendment thereto of February 28, 1919, 40 Stat. 1189, 1200, c. 69 (Comp. St.  7477bb) and the Federal Highway Act of November 9, 1921, c. 119, 42 Stat. 212 (Comp. St.  7477 1\/4 et seq.), is authorized to co-operate with the states, through their respective highway departments, in the construction of rural post roads. These require that no money appropriated under their provisions shall be expended in any state until it shall by its legislature have assented to the provisions of the acts. They provide that the Secretary of Agriculture and the state highway department of each state shall agree upon the roads to be constructed therein and the character and method of their construction. The construction work in each state is to be done in accordance with its laws, and under the supervision of the state highway department, subject to the inspection and approval of the Secretary and in accord with his rules and regulations made pursuant to the federal acts. The states are required to maintain the roads so constructed according to their laws. In case of failure of a state to maintain any highway within its boundaries after construction or reconstruction, the Secretary is authorized to proceed on notice to have the highway placed in proper condition of maintenance, at the charge and cost of the federal funds allotted to the state, \n\n[274 U.S. 135, 141]\n\u00a0\n and henceforth to refuse any further project in such state until the state shall reimburse the government for such maintenance and shall pay into the federal highway fund for reapportionment among all the states the sum thus expended.\n By section 5, chapter 237, of the General Laws of Oregon for 1917, the Oregon Highway way Law was passed. That creates a highway commission, with authority to carry out the provisions of the act, and to exercise general supervision over all matters pertaining to the construction of state highways and to determine the general policy of the highway department. By section 5 the Oregon Legislature assents to the provisions of the act of Congress of 1916, furnishing aid in the construction of rural post roads, and the department is authorized to enter into all contracts and agreements with the national government relating to the survey, construction, improvement, and maintenance of the roads under the act of Congress, and to submit any scheme of construction as may be required by the Secretary of Agriculture, and to do all things necessary to carry out the co-operation contemplated by the act. The good faith of the state is pledged to make the available funds sufficient to equal the funds apportioned to the state by the government, and to maintain the roads constructed or improved with the aid of funds so appropriated and to make adequate provision for carrying out such maintenance. By General Laws of Oregon 1917, pp. 256, 268, c. 194,  28, in force when the first federal act was passed, it was provided that no motor truck of over 5 tons capacity should be driven or operated on any road or highway of the state, except with the consent and upon a permit issued by the county court of the county wherein such truck was sought to be driven or operated, and this was the provision of law in force when the law was passed accepting the federal acts for Oregon. By the General Laws Oregon 1921, c. 371,  35, \n\n[274 U.S. 135, 142]\n\u00a0\n it was provided that the highway commission and the county court might grant special permits to permit any vehicle having with its load a combined weight in excess of 22,000 pounds, to move on the highways, the permission to be written and to include such terms, rules, and stipulations as the commission or court might deem proper. By section 36 of the same act, whenever in the judgment of the state highway commission or any county court or board of county commissioners of any county it would be for the best interests of the state or county and for the protection from undue damage of any highway or highways or any sections thereof, to reduce the maximum weights and speeds in the act provided for vehicles moving over or upon the highways of the state, and to fix the reduced weights and speeds and prohibit the use of such highways for any other weights, authority is given such commission or board to do so and to post a notice of the limitation.\n The order complained of, set forth as an exhibit to the amended bill of complaint, recites that the commission, as a result of due investigation, finds that the road is being damaged and injured on account of the kind and character of traffic now being hauled over it, and that the loads of maximum weight moved at the maximum speed are breaking up, damaging and deteriorating the road, and that it will therefore be for the best interests of the state highway that the maximum weight be reduced from 22,000 to 16,500, and that changes be made with respect to tires and their width.\n The amended bill gives a history of the highway and its continued use for a weight of 22,000 pounds for four years, which has been availed of by the appellants as common carriers and as members of an Auto Freight Transportation Association of Oregon and Washington, with costly terminals in Portland established by requirement of that city; that the 22 miles \n\n[274 U.S. 135, 143]\n\u00a0\n of the Columbia River Highway here involved is a part of the interstate highway from Astoria, Or., into the state of Washington, and all subject to the federal Highway Acts, and that this order will interfere with interstate commerce thereon. The amended bill denies the damage to the road as found by the highway commission, and says that the reduction of the limit will be unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory. It avers that the plaintiffs have been engaged in active competition with steam railroads paralleling the Columbia River Highway and charging rates of traffic which unless the appellants can use trucks combined with loads of 22,000 pounds will prevent their doing business except at a loss. It alleges that the acts of Congress and of Oregon constitute a contract by which the permission for the use of a 5-ton combined weight of truck and load is a term which cannot be departed from by the state highway commission, and constitutes a protection to the plaintiffs of which they may avail themselves in this action.\n An examination of the acts of Congress discloses no provision, express or implied, by which there is withheld from the state its ordinary police power to conserve the highways in the interest of the public and to prescribe such reasonable regulations for their use as may be wise to prevent injury and damage to them. In the absence of national legislation especially covering the subject of interstate commerce, the state may rightly prescribe uniform regulations adapted to promote safety upon its highways and the conservation of their use, applicable alike to vehicles moving in interstate commerce and those of its own citizens. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 U.S. 610\n, 622, et seq., 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30. Of course the state may not discriminate against interstate commerce. Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A. L. R. 286. But there is no sufficient averment of such discrimination in the bill. In the Kuykendall Case this court said (page 315 (45 S. Ct. 325)):\n\n\n[274 U.S. 135, 144]\n\u00a0\n 'With the increase in number and size of the vehicles used upon a highway, both the danger and the wear and tear grow. To exclude unnecessary vehicles-particularly the large ones commonly used by carriers for hire-promotes both safety and economy. State regulation of that character is valid even as applied to interstate commerce, in the absence of legislation by Congress which deals specifically with the subject. Vandalia R. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n242 U.S. 255\n, (37 S. Ct. 93); Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., \n211 U.S. 612\n (29 S. Ct. 214). Neither the recent federal highway acts nor the earlier post road acts (Rev. Stat. par. 3964 (Comp. St.  7456); Act March 1, 1884, c. 9, 23 Stat. 3 (Comp. St.  7457)) do that.'\n The mere fact that a truck company may not make a profit unless it can use a truck with load weighing 22,000 or more pounds does not show that a regulation forbidding it is either discriminatory or unreasonable. That it prevents competition with freight traffic on parallel steam railroads may possibly be a circumstance to be considered in determining the reasonableness of such a limitation, though that is doubtful, but it is necessarily outweighed when it appears by decision of competent authority that such weight is injurious to the highway for the use of the general public and unduly increases the cost of maintenance and repair. In the absence of any averments of specific facts to show fraud or abuse of discretion, we must accept the judgment of the highway commission upon this question which is committed to their decision as against merely general averments denying their official finding.\n Nor is there anything either in the federal or state legislation to support the argument that the agreement between the national and state government requires that the weight of truck and load which was permitted by the state when the agreement was made binds the state constractually to continue such permission. Conserving \n\n[274 U.S. 135, 145]\n\u00a0\n limitation is something that must rest with the road supervising authorities of the state, not only on the general constitutional distinction between national and state powers, but also for the additional reason having regard to the argument based on a contract that under the convention between the United States and the state in respect to these jointly aided roads, the maintenance after construction is primarily imposed on the state. Regulation as to the method of use therefore necessarily remains with the state and cannot be interfered with unless the regulation is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to defeat the useful purposes for which Congress has made its large contribution to bettering the highway systems of the Union and to facilitating the carrying of the mails over them. There is no averment of the bill or any showing by affidavit making out such a case.\n The temporary injunction was rightly refused, and the motion to dismiss the bill was properly granted.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOSLER SAFE CO. v. ELY-NORRIS SAFE CO.(1927)\nNo. 94\nArgued: January 7, 1927Decided: January 17, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Samuel Owen Edmonds, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Lawrence Bristol, Julius M. Mayer, and F. P. Warfield, all of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by a corporation of New Jersey against a corporation of New York alleging unfair competition. It was treated below as a suit by the only manufacturer of safes containing an explosion chamber for protection against burglars. It seeks an injunction against selling safes with a metal band around the door in the place where the plaintiff put the chamber, or falsely representing that the defendant's safes contain an explosion chamber. The plaintiff admitted that \n\n[273 U.S. 132, 133]\n\u00a0\n the defendant's safes bore the defendant's name and address and that the defendant never gave any customer reason to believe that its safes were of the plaintiff's make. The District Court, following American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Manufacturing Co. (C. C. A.) 103 F. 281, 50 L. R. A. 609, held that representations such as were sought to be enjoined did not give a private cause of action. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that if, as it took it to be alleged, the plaintiff had the monopoly of explosion chambers and the defendant falsely represented that its safes had such chambers, the plaintiff had a good case, and that since the decision above cited the law had grown more liberal in granting relief. It therefore reversed the decree below. 7 F. (2d) 603. In view of the conflict between the Circuit Courts of Appeals a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n268 \nU.S. 684\n, 45 S. Ct. 515\n\n\n At the hearing below all attention seems to have been concentrated on the question passed upon and the forcibly stated reasons that induced this Court of Appeals to differ from that for the Sixth Circuit. But, upon a closer scrutiny of the bill than seems to have been invited before, it does not present that broad and interesting issue. The bill alleges that the plaintiff has a patent for an explosion chamber 'as described and claimed in said letters patent'; that it has the exclusive right to make and sell 'safes containing such an explosion chamber'; that no other safes containing 'such an explosion chamber' could be got in the United States before the defendant, as it is alleged, infringed the plaintiff's patent, for which alleged infringement a suit is pending. It then is alleged that the defendant is making and selling safes with a metal band around the door at substantially the same location as the explosion chamber of plaintiff's safes, and has represented to the public 'that the said metal band was employed to cover or close an explosion chamber' by reason of which 'the public has been led to pur- \n\n[273 U.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n chase defendant's said safes as and for safes containing an explosion chamber, such as is manufactured and sold by the plaintiff herein.' It is alleged further that sometimes the defendant's safes have no explosion chamber under the band but are bought by those who want safes with a chamber and so the defendant has deprived the plaintiff of sales, competed unfairly and damaged the plaintiff's reputation. The plaintiff relies upon its patent suit for relief in respect of the sales of safes alleged to infringe its rights. It complains here only of false representations as to safes that do not infringe but that are sold as having explosion chambers although in fact they do not.\n It is consistent with every allegation in the bill and the defendant in argument asserted it to be a fact, that there are other safes with explosion chambers beside that for which the plaintiff has a patent. The defendant is charged only with representing that its safes had 'an explosion chamber, which, so far as appears, it had a perfect right to do if the representation was true. If on the other hand the representation was false as it is alleged sometimes to have been, there is nothing to show that customers had they known the facts would have gone to the plaintiff rather than to other competitors in the market, or to lay a foundation for the claim for a loss of sales. The bill is so framed as to seem to invite the decision that was obtained from the Circuit Court of Appeals, but when scrutinized is seen to have so limited its statements as to exclude the right to complain.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMYERS v. HURLEY MOTOR CO.(1927)\nNo. 65\nArgued: December 9, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 18, 19]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George P. Lemm, of Washington, D. C., for Myers.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry C. Clark, of Washington, D. C., for Hurley Motor Co., Inc.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts which give rise to the questions of law in respect of which the instruction of this court is asked are set forth in the certificate as follows:\n'Clarence H. Myers, plaintiff in error, on the 28th day of April, 1923, then a minor of the age of 20 years, represented to the defendant company that he was 24 years of age, and engaged in the hacking business in the District of Columbia; whereupon he contracted with defendant for a Hudson touring car at the price of $650, upon terms set out in a conditional sales contract. Plaintiff turned in as cash payment a Ford touring car at the price of $250, which was subsequently sold by defendant company for that price. Plaintiff subsequently made payments on the contract to the amount of $156.12, making a total payment on the contract of $406.12.\n\n'On October 3, 1923, plaintiff being in default in his payments, defendant company repossessed itself of the Hudson car, under the terms of its sale agreement. Plaintiff attained the age of 21 years on October 21, 1923, and, on the 1st day of November following, disaffirmed his contract and demanded the return of $406.12, the amount paid upon the contract. Upon defendant's refusal to comply with plaintiff's request, the present suit was brought in the municipal court of the District of Columbia by plaintiff to recover $ 406.12, the amount paid by him.\n\n'Defendant company set up, as a counterclaim, the amount of $525.96, supported by a bill of particulars, showing that this amount was required in the way of repairs and expense to place the Hudson car in as good condition as it was when sold to plaintiff. The municipal court gave judgment upon defendant's plea of set-off for the full amount of $525.96, from which the case was brought to the Court of Appeals on writ of error.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n 'The misrepresentation by plaintiff of his age, supported by evidence that he had the appearance of a man of 24, at the time the contract was made, and the depreciation in the value of the Hudson car from hard and abusive usage, are not denied by plaintiff, and may be accepted for the purpose of this case as conceded facts. Neither does it appear that any deception or misrepresentations were made by the defendant in order to induce the making of the contract, nor that the contract was in any respect an unfair one. Plaintiff rests his case entirely upon his absolute right, on becoming of age, to disaffirm his contract, and recover the amount which he had paid thereon, regardless of any damage the defendant may have sustained, either from his misrepresentation as to his correct age, or from his abusive use of the Hudson car, which resulted in the depreciation above set forth.'\n Two questions are certified:\n\n\n (1)\n Is the plaintiff, by reason of the misrepresentations as to his correct age, estopped from maintaining an action to recover the amount paid under the conditional sales contract upon the purchase price of the Hudson car?\n\n\n (2)\n If the plaintiff is not so estopped, may defendant, by way of affirmative defense against plaintiff's claim, set off the amount paid for the repair of the damaged Hudson car, or so much thereof as will equal plaintiff's claim?\n First. In Sims v. Everhardt, \n102 U.S. 300\n, 313, which was a suit in equity, this court said:\n'Without spending time to look at the reason, the authorities are all one way. An estoppel in pais is not applicable to infants, and a fraudulent representation of capacity cannot be an equivalent for actual capacity. Brown v. McCune, 5 Sandf. (7 N. Y. Super Ct.) 224; Keen v. Coleman, 39 Pa. 299 (80 Am. Dec. 524). A conveyance by an infant is an assertion of his right to convey. A contemporaneous \n\n[273 U.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n declaration of his right or of his age adds nothing to what is implied in his deed. An assertion of an estoppel against him is but a claim that he has assented or contracted. But he can no more do that effectively than he can make the contract alleged to be confirmed.'\n\n The statement that the authorities are all one way in holding that an estoppel in pais is not-that is to say, is never-applicable to infants, at least of doubtful accuracy when made, is clearly incorrect at the present time A review shows that many, perhaps the major part, of the state decisions, hold that in equity the rule is otherwise. See Bigelow on Estoppel (6th Ed.) 627; 1 Williston on Contracts,  245. In any event, the most that can be said is that the decisions upon that subject are conflicting and to some degree in confusion. The doctrine of the Everhardt Case, however, was followed in MacGreal v. Taylor, \n167 \nU.S. 688, 696\n, 17 S. Ct. 961, and has been made the basis of decisions in several of the lower federal courts (Bartlett v. Okla. Oil Co. (D. C.) 218 F. 380, 391; Alfrey v. Colbert (C. C. A.) 168 F. 231, 235; Sanger v. Hibbard (C. C. A.) 104 F. 455, 457), and has become the established federal rule. Likewise it has been accepted and followed by many of the state courts. See, for example, Tobin v. Spann, 85 Ark. 556, 559, 109 S. W. 534, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 672; Cobbey v. Buchanan, 48 Neb. 391, 394, 67 N. W. 176; Kirkham v. Wheeler-Osgood Co., 39 Wash. 415, 424, 81 P. 869, 4 Ann. Cas. 532; Alvey v. Reed, 115 Ind. 148, 149, 17 N. E. 265, 7 Am. St. Rep. 418. In this state of the matter, we are not disposed now to re-examine the question in the light of the conflict of authority; but, following the Everhardt Case, we hold that the doctrine of estoppel in pais cannot be invoked to defeat plaintiff's action.\n Second. While adhering to the determination in the Everhardt Case, that the doctrine of estoppel in pais does not apply to an infant, we are of opinion that this does not require us, under the facts of the present case, to deny defendant the benefit of its affirmative defense. \n\n[273 U.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n In the Everhardt Case, there was a dismissal by the court below on the ground that it did not appear that there was a disaffirmance by the complainant within a reasonable time after she attained her majority. The bill offered to do equity (page 301 (26 L. Ed. 87)), but this court, in reversing the decree and remanding the cause, expressed no opinion in respect of the equities by which a decree for complainant might be conditioned. The effect of an affirmative defense such as we have here was neither involved nor considered. Whether an infant, who fraudulently misrepresents his age and thereby induces the making of a contract, can, when he brings a suit in equity in respect of the matter, be compelled to do equity, is a question not concluded by that decision. In MacGreal v. Taylor, supra, after first calling attention to the fact (page 698 (17 S. Ct. 961)) that the opinion in the Everhardt Case did not deal with the counter equities, this court said (page 700 (17 S. Ct. 965)):\n'A court of equity will look at the real transaction, and will do justice to the adult if it can be done without disregarding or impairing the principle that allows an infant, upon arriving at majority, to disaffirm his contracts made during infancy.'\n\n Here the action brought by the quondam infant is one for money had and received-the payments under the disaffirmed contract having been either in money or in property converted into money before the disaffirmance. Such an action, though brought at law, is in its nature a substitute for a suit in equity; and it is to be determined by the application of equitable principles. In other words, the rights of the parties are to be determined as they would be upon a bill in equity. The defendant may rely upon any defense which shows that the plaintiff in equity and good conscience is not entitled to recover in whole or in part. Rathbone v. Stocking, 2 Barb, (N. Y.) 135, 145, 147; Barr v. Craig, 2 Dall. 151, 154; Wright v. Butler, 6 Wend. (N. Y.) 284, 290, 21 Am. Dec. 323; Eddy v. Smith, 13 Wend. (N. Y.) 488, \n\n[273 U.S. 18, 25]\n\u00a0\n 490; Christie v. Durden, 205 Ala. 571, 572, 88 So. 667; Gifford v. Wilcox, 81 Ind. App. 378, 381, 143 N. E. 368.\n It has been held that, where an infant, after coming of age, seeks the aid of a court of equity to avoid a contract, under which he has received property, and restore to him the possession of obligations with which he has parted, he will be required, wholly irrespective of his own good faith in the transaction, to do equity, which may extend to compelling him to make full satisfaction for the deterioration of the property due to his use or abuse of it.\n In Gray v. Lessington, 15 N. Y. Super. Ct. 257, the plaintiff, alleging her infancy, brought suit to rescind a contract of sale and to cancel a mortgage and unpaid notes. A decree in her favor imposed the condition that she should restore the property and account for the deterioration arising from its use. The court, sustaining this on appeal, said (page 262):\n'And when it becomes necessary for her to go into a court of equity to cancel her obligations, or regain the pledge given for their performance, seeking equity, she must do equity. Making full satisfaction for the deterioration of the property, arising from its use, is doing no more. Presumptively, she has derived from the use of the property a profit, or benefit, equivalent to such deterioration. Whether that presumption is, under all circumstances, conclusive, it is not necessary to say, since there is nothing in this case to rebut the presumption. The deterioration here is found to have resulted from the use which she has enjoyed; and, if it resulted from an abuse of the property, the plaintiff's equity is no greater.'\n\n The same rule is recognized in Hillyer v. Bennett, 3 Edw. Ch. (N. Y.) 222, 225. In that case, after pointing out that the acts and deeds of an infant are voidable at his election, that if sued at law or in equity he may plead his infancy in bar, and that if he has agreed to sell and deliver \n\n[273 U.S. 18, 26]\n\u00a0\n personal property he may disaffirm the contract and bring trover to recover it back, the vice chancellor said:\n'But if, after he comes of age, he seeks to disaffirm and avoid his contract in a court of equity and files his bill there for the purpose of obtaining its aid, in restoring to himself the possession of the property he has parted with, a court of equity must deal with him as it would with any other adult party and require him to do equity before he shall have equity done unto him. He must restore what he received when he parted with the property which he seeks to get back; especially, if it appears that the other dealt with him in ignorance of the fact of his nonage. This equitable and just principle is recognized by Woodworth, J., ((Roof v. Stafford) 7 Cowen ( N. Y.) 183), and is warranted by several cases there cited.'\n\n See, also, 1 Story's Equity (11th Ed.)  240; Carmen v. Fox Film Corporation (C. C. A.) 269 F. 928, 931, 15 A. L. R. 1209; Rice v. Butler, 160 N. Y. 578, 55 N. E. 275, 47 L. R. A. 303, 73 Am. St. Rep. 703; International Land Co. v. Marshall, 22 Okl. 693, 708, 98 P. 951, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1056\n\n\n How far the equitable maxim, that he who seeks equity must do equity, applies generally in suits brought for relief because of infancy, we need not inquire; nor do we need here to go as far as the authorities just cited. The maxim applies, at least, where there has been, as there was here, actual fraud on the part of the infant. When an infant of mature appearance, by false and fraudulent representations as to his age, has induced another person to sell and deliver property to him, it is against natural justice to permit the infant to recover money paid for the property without first compelling him to account for the injury which his deceit has inflicted upon the other person.\n Our conclusion that the affirmative defense is available in this action does not rest upon the doctrine of estoppel, though the result may be the same. It recognizes the \n\n[273 U.S. 18, 27]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff's right to repudiate his promise and sue for the return of his payments, and his immunity from a plea of estoppel in so doing. Its effect is not to enforce the disaffirmed contract directly or indirectly, but to allow him to invoke the aid of the court to enforce an equitable remedy arising from the disaffirmance only upon condition that, 'seeking equity, he must do equity.' And the application of the maxim is not precluded because defendant's claim might not be enforceable in any other manner. 1 Pomeroy's Equity,  386; Sturgis v. Champneys, 5 Myl. & C. 97, 102; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Denver, L. & G. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 126 F. 46, 51.\n The question remains whether defendant should have judgment for the amount by which its expenditures exceeded plaintiff's demand. We are not advised of any statutory rule upon the subject applicable in the District of Columbia; and the matter must be determined in accordance with general principles. The defense, in effect, is that the plaintiff was guilty of tortious conduct to the injury of the defendant in the transaction out of which his own cause of action arose. In such case it is well settled that the relief is by way of recoupment-that is, that the amount of defendant's damage can be allowed only in abatement or diminution of plaintiff's claim- and that defendant cannot, at least in that action, recover any excess. Winder v. Caldwell, 14 How. 434, 443; Dushane v. Benedict, \n120 \nU.S. 630, 642\n, 7 S. Ct. 696; Ward v. Fellers, 3 Mich. 281, 287, 291; Waterman v. Clark et al., 76 Ill. 428, 430; Holcraft v. Mellott, 57 Ind. 539, 544.\n It follows that the first question should be answered in the negative and the second question in the affirmative, with the qualification that the amount allowed defendant shall not exceed the amount of plaintiff's claim.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMYERS v. INTERNATIONAL TRUST CO.(1927)\nNo. 122\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. John R. Lazenby, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the International Trust Co. in a Superior Court of Massachusetts against Samuel A. Myers and Harry Meyers, partners composing the firm of S. A. & H. Myers, to hold them undividually liable upon certain notes that had been executed by the partnership, in the firm name, for a partnership obligation, and endorsed by them personally. The defense was that the individual liabilities of the defendants had been dis- \n\n[273 U.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n charged by a composition in a prior proceeding in bankruptcy. The Superior Court sustained this defense, and dismissed the plaintiff's bill. On appeal the Supreme Judicial Court-without entering judgment-directed the Superior Court, by a rescript, to reverse its decree and enter a decree for the plaintiff. International Trust Co. v. Myers, 252 Mass. 94, 147 N. E. 591. The Superior Court, pursuant to the rescript, entered a decree against the defendants in the respective amounts of their individual obligations as indorsers upon the notes. \n1\n This being, under the practice that was followed,2 the final decree in the case and not appealable, Boston, Petitioner, 223 Mass. 36, 111 N. E. 412, is to be regarded as the final decision of the highest court of the State in which a decision could be had; and the writ of certiorari was therefore properly directed to the Superior Court. See Davis v. Cohen Co., \n268 \nU.S. 638, 639\n, 45 S. Ct. 633\n\n\n The Bankruptcy Act3 provides, in so far as pertinent here, that a partnership may be adjudged a bankrupt, section 5a (Comp. St.  9589); that a 'bankrupt-including, as defined by section 1a (Comp. St.  9585), a person against whom an involuntary petition has been filed-'may offer, either before or after adjudication, terms of composition to his creditors,' after filing 'the schedule of his property and the list of his creditors,' section 12a, as amended (Comp. St.  9596); that upon the confirmation of a composition the consideration shall be distributed as the judge shall direct, section 12e; and that the confirmation, 'shall discharge the bankrupt from his debts,' section 14c (Comp. St.  9598).\n The proceedings in the prior bankruptcy case, shortly stated,4 show that creditors of the firm of S. A. & H. Myers filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy, praying that \n\n[273 U.S. 380, 382]\n\u00a0\n it be adjudged a bankrupt. There was no prayer that the partners be adjudged bankrupts individually. A partnership schedule, signed and sworn to by the partners, was filed, showing the partnership property and listing the partnership creditors. In this the plaintiff's notes were listed as unsecured debts of the partnership, with no statement that they were indorsed; and each of the partners stated that he had no individual debts and no individual assets that were not exempt. Thereafter, before any adjudication the partners offered terms of composition, at forty per cent., to the unsecured creditors. The consideration therefor was deposited in the court; the composition was confirmed; and the consideration distributed among the partnership creditors. The plaintiff, as a creditor of the partnership listed in the schedule, received its proportion of the consideration, which it credited on the notes before bringing the present suit.\n No offer of composition was made to the creditors of the individual partners, who were not listed; no consideration was deposited for them; and none was received by the plaintiff on account of the individual obligations of the partners as indorsers on the notes.\n We are not called upon to determine whether the discharge of the notes as debts of the partnership which resulted from the confirmation of the composition, carried with it the discharge of the defendants, as partners, from the liabilities on the notes as partnership debts which arose from their membership in the firm. \n5\n The Supreme Judicial Court predicated the liabilities of the defendants solely on their personal indorsements, and the \n\n[273 U.S. 380, 383]\n\u00a0\n decree was based on their respective liabilities as such indorsers. And the sole question here presented is whether the composition discharged them, as individuals, from the obligations arising by reason of their indorsements.\n This question must be answered in the light of the principle stated by the Supreme Judicial Court, that a 'composition partakes of the nature of a contract.' It is settled by the decisions of this court in Cumberland Glass Co. v. De Witt, \n237 \nU.S. 447, 453\n, 454 S., 35 S. Ct. 636, and Nassau Works v. Brightwood Co., \n265 \nU.S. 269, 271\n, 273 S., 274, 44 S. Ct. 506, that a composition is 'a settlement of the bankrupt with his creditors'-in a measure superseding and outside of the bankruptcy proceedings-which originates in a voluntary offer by the bankrupt, and results, in the main, from voluntary acceptance by his creditors; that the respective rights of the bankrupt and the creditors are fixed by the terms of the offer; and that upon the confirmation of the composition they get what they 'bargained for,' and no more. And see, In re Coe (C. C. A.) 186 F. 745, 747; In re Adler (D. C.) 103 F. 444, 446; In re Lane (D. C.) 125 F. 772, 773.\n Here the partnership, being proceeded against as a distinct legal entity, Meek v. Centre County Banking Co., \n268 \nU.S. 426, 431\n, 45 S. Ct. 560, could offer terms of composition to its creditors, under section 12a, after filing a schedule of its property and a list of its creditors. It filed such a schedule and list. And-although the District Court in Massachusetts had always refused to adjudge the bankruptcy of a partnership unless the partners were also adjudged bankrupts, In re Forbes (D. C.) 128 F. 137, 140,6 and doubtless \n\n[273 U.S. 380, 384]\n\u00a0\n would have permitted the terms of composition to be offered to the creditors of the partners as well as to the creditors of the partnership- we think it clear that, read in the light of the schedule, the offer of the terms of composition was made only to the partnership creditors listed in the schedule, for whom the required consideration was deposited, and not to the creditors of the individual partners, who were not listed and for whom no consideration was deposited; in short, that the 'bargain' was made only with the partnership creditors and in respect to the partnership debts. The necessary result is that the confirmation of the composition merely discharged the partnership debts, and did not discharge the separate debts of the partners to their individual creditors, who were offered and received no consideration for such release.\n That, as was said by the Supreme Judicial court, the indorsements of the notes by the defendants 'created individual obligations, separate and distinct from the firm obligations,' is clear; it being well settled in Massachusetts that a partner who indorses a firm note as an individual, incurs-in addition to the liability for the partnership debt arising from his membership in the firm-a distinct and separate liability arising by reason of his personal indorsement. Roger Williams Nat. Bank v. Hall, 160 Mass. 171, 35 N. E. 666; Faneuil Hall Nat. Bank v. Meloon, 183 Mass. 66, 67, 66 N. E. 410, 97 Am. St. Rep. 416; Fourth Nat. Bank v. Mead, 216 Mass. 521, 523, 104 N. E. 377, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 225. As was said in the Meloon Case, the defendants 'were none the less indorsers and none the less liable as such because they were also liable as members of the firm which made the note.' And see Robinson v. Seaboard Nat. Bank (C. C. A.) 247 F. 1007, 1008, 10 A. L. R. 842, Matter of Peck, 206 N. Y. 55, 60, 90 N. E. 258, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1223, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 798, and Wilder v. Keeler, 3 Paige (N. Y.) 167, 176.\n It also results, from the very nature of a composition, that where the terms offered and accepted go merely to the discharge of the maker of a note, its confirmation does not release an indorser from his separate liability for which no \n\n[273 U.S. 380, 385]\n\u00a0\n 'bargain' was made. See Easton Furn. Mfg. Co. v. Caminez, 146 App. Div. 436, 438, 131 N. Y. S. 157, Silverman v. Rubenstein (Sup.) 162 N. Y. S. 733, 735, Bromberg v. Self, 16 Ala. App. 627, 628, 80 So. 631, and Guild v. Butler, 122 Mass. 498, 500, 23 Am. Rep. 378.\n Nor do we think that the effect of the composition of the partnership debts was enlarged so as to include the discharge of the defendants from their personal liabilities as indorsers, by the fact that the plaintiff was scheduled as a partnership creditor and received, as such, its proportion of the consideration deposited. The Supreme Judicial Court rightly said that the plaintiff was a party to the composition 'only to the extent in which its claim against the partnership was concerned; it was not recognized as an individual creditor; no offer was made to it as the holder of a claim against the individuals. In this respect it was a stranger to the offer; it stood as any other individual creditor whose demand was not listed, to whom no offer of compromise was made and who entered into no bargain with the defendants.'\n We conclude that the composition did not discharge the defendants from their individual and personal obligations as indorsers upon the notes. And the decree, which merely enforced their liabilities as such indorsers, must therefore be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These amounts differed, as one note was indorsed by only one of the defendants. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Gen.

Auerbach, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. George Whitefield Betts, Jr., and Mark W. Maclay, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the right of a wharf owner to preferential payment from the proceeds of a vessel, for wharfage furnished the vessel while in the custody of a United States marshal under a warrant of arrest in admiralty. The owner of the steamship Poznan entered into a contract with petitioner, the owner of a private pier in New York harbor, for the use of the pier for discharging cargo from December 1, 1920, until completion. The rate agreed upon was $250 per day, plus certain incidental charges not now material. On December 2, 1920, the Poznan was made fast to the pier. Later in the day, she was arrested by the United States marshal for the district upon libels, afterward consolidated into a single cause, for nondelivery of the vessel's cargo and for damages for breach of contracts of affreightment. The mrrshal allowed the vessel to remain at the pier. Later, on application of one of the libeling cargo owners, the District Court ordered the delivery of a part of the cargo which that libelant had shipped and made the order applicable to all other libelants who should make a like claim. The discharge of the cargo was then begun and deliveries were made to the several libelants in the consolidated cause, including respondent, the John B. Harris Company.\n After the cargo had been about one-half discharged, the charterer applied to the District Court for leave to move the vessel to another pier where the cargo could be removed more expeditiously; but, on request of some of the libelants and a committee representing the ship- \n\n[274 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n pers, the application was denied on January 5, 1921. The vessel was unloaded by February 18, 1921. Delivery of the cargo from the pier was completed March 1, 1921, but the vessel remained fast to the pier to and including March 11, 1921, when she was removed.\n Meanwhile, the marshal having declined to pay the bill for wharfage without an order of the court, petitioner, in April, 1921, filed its libel against the vessel for the balance of wharfage charges unpaid, aggregating $ 17,462. By order of the District Court, the libelants in the consolidated cause were permitted to intervene. Respondent, the John B. Harris Company, served notice of intervention, and filed its answer denying the allegations in the libel and praying that it be dismissed on the ground, among others, that the wharfage was furnished while the vessel was in the custody of the marshal, and hence no maritime lien could arise. Respondent has since prosecuted the defense in behalf of all the other libelants in the consolidated cause.\n The vessel was later sold under an order in the consolidated cause and the proceeds, which were not enough to satisfy the libelants, paid into the registry of the court. The libelants in the consolidated suit have made common cause by stipulation that the recovery under the final decree should be paid to trustees and distributed in accordance with the instructions of a committee representing all of them. The committee found the total claims of the libelants to exceed the amount of the proceeds of the ship. A pro rata distribution has been made to the claimants and an adequate amount reserved to pay the demand of the petitioner, if allowed in this suit. The marshal, although refusing petitioner's request for payment of the wharfage charge, nevertheless included it in his bill of costs and expenses in the consolidated cause and charged his commission on this amount. The court disallowed these items, but 'without prejudice to any \n\n[274 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n rights of the New York Dock Company to have recourse against the proceeds of the vessel. ...'\n The District Court, in the present libel, allowed as a preferential payment from the proceeds of the ship, the reasonable value of the benefits resulting to the consolidated libelants from the wharfage and incidental service furnished by petitioner, to be determined by a special master. This was found by the master and held by the District Court to be the reasonable value of the wharfage. A decree for this amount, less certain payments on account made by the owner of the ship, pursuant to the original contract of wharfage (The Poznan (D. C.) 297 F. 345), was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (9 F. (2d) 838). This court granted certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 547\n, 46 S. Ct. 106.\n The court below held that as the wharfage was furnished after the arrest of the ship, and while it was in the custody of the law, no maritime lien could attach, and that a preferential payment could not be supported upon any other theory applicable to the facts of this case.\n A question much argued, both here and below, was whether the case could be considered an exception to the general rule that there can be no martitime lien for services furnished a vessel while in custodia legis. Cf. The Young America (D. C.) 30 F. 789; The Nisseqogue (D. C.) 280 F. 174; Paxson v. Cunningham (C. C. A.) 63 F. 132; The Willamette Valley (C. C. A.) 66 F. 565. But, in the view we take, the case does not turn upon possible exceptions to that rule, as we think petitioner's right of recovery depends, as the District Court ruled, not upon the existence of a maritime lien, but upon principles of general application which should govern whenever a court undertakes the administration of property or a fund brought into its custody for the benefit of suitors.\n The libelants in the consolidated cause were not only concerned as owners in securing delivery of the cargo, but as lienors they were interested in the ship and, as eventually appeared, in the whole of her proceeds. Serv- \n\n[274 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n ice rendered to the ship after arrest, in aid of the discharge of cargo, and afterward pending the sale, necessarily inured to their benefit, for it contributed to the creation of the fund now available to them. The most elementary notion of justice would seem to require that services or property furnished upon the authority of the court or its officer, acting within his authority, for the common benefit of those interested in a fund administered by the court, should be paid from the fund as an 'expense of justice.' The Phebe, 1 Ware, 354, 359, Fed. Cas. No. 11,065. This is the familiar rule of courts of equity when administering a trust fund or property in the hands of receivers. The rule is extended, in making disposition of the earnings of the property in the hands of the receiver, to require payment of sums due for supplies furnished before the receivership, where their use by the debtor or receiver in the operation of the property has produced the earnings. See Fosdick v. Schall, \n99 U.S. 235\n; Thomas v. Western Car Co., \n149 \nU.S. 95, 110\n, 13 S. Ct. 824; Virginia & Alabama Coal Co. v. Central R. R., \n170 \nU.S. 355\n, 18 S. Ct. 657: St. Louis. etc., R. R. v. Cleveland, etc., Ry., \n125 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 673 S., 8 S. Ct. 1011; Southern Ry. v. Carnegie Steel Co., \n176 \nU.S. 257\n, 20 S. Ct. 347; Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City Ry. (D. C.) 208 F. 168; Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City Ry. (C. C. A.) 216 F. 458, 470.\n Such preferential payments are mere incidents to the judicial administration of a fund. They are not to be explained in terms of equitable liens in the technical sense, as is the case with agreements that particular property shall be applied as security for the satisfaction of particular obligations or vendors' liens and the like, which are enforced by plenary suits in equity. They result rather from the self- imposed duty of the court, in the exercise of its accustomed jurisdiction, to require that expenses which have contributed either to the preservation or creation of the fund in its custody shall be paid before a general distribution among those entitled to receive it. \n\n[274 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n We need not inquire here into the exact limits of the powers of courts of admiralty to administer equitable relief as distinguished from that peculiar to the courts of admiralty. This is not a suit, as the court below seemed to think, for the enforcement of an equitable lien. The court of admiralty is asked, in the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction, to administer the fund within its custody in accordance with equitable principles as is its wont. Cf. United States v. Cornell Steamboat Co., \n202 \nU.S. 184, 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 648; The Eclipse, \n135 \nU.S. 599, 608\n, 10 S. Ct. 873; Benedict, Admiralty (5th Ed.)  70. It is defraying from the proceeds of the ship in its registry an expense which it has permitted for the common benefit and which, in equity and good conscience, should be satisfied before the libelants may enjoy the fruits of their liens.\n Such a preferential payment from the proceeds of the ship, for wharfage furnished to her while in custody, was allowed by the court below in The St. Paul (C. C. A.) 271 F. 265. But in the present case that court thought that The St. Paul Case was to be distinguished on the ground that there the wharfage service was furnished and the obligation incurred in accordance with an order made by the court and with the consent of the libelants. But here the court denied a motion to remove the ship from petitioner's wharf with the consent of some of the libelants and with full knowledge of all concerned that the wharfage was then being furnished. The libelants in the consolidated cause, who are united in interest with respondent in the present case, thus appear to have acquiesced in this determination. We are unable to perceive any basis for a distinction between action of the court in authorizing the ship to proceed to the wharf to enable it to discharge its cargo in the one case, and authorizing it to remain there for a like purpose in the other. It is enough if the court approves the service rendered or per- \n\n[274 U.S. 117, 123]\n\u00a0\n mits it to be rendered, and it inures to the benefit of the property or funds in its custody.\n Objection is made that the amount found by the special master and confirmed by the District Court as the reasonable value of the wharfage furnished is excessive, but this issue of fact was fairly tried. The finding of the special commissioner is supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed here. Respondent attempts to raise here questions with respect to the amount of recovery which were neither raised nor considered below. We have examined them only so far as is necessary to ascertain that no error was committed by the district court so plain or apparent as to warrant our consideration on such a state of the record.

NEW YORK CENT. R. CO.(1927)\nNo. 235\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Luther M.

Defendants in error demurred to the complaint asserting that it failed to state a cause of action and that the Commission's order was void for want of jurisdiction because it dealt solely with charges for transportation from a point in Canada to a point in the United States. The District Court sustained the demurrer and gave judgment of dismissal. The case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals; and, after hearing the parties, that court certified certain questions concerning which it desires instructions for the proper decision of the cause. Section 239, Judicial Code; U. S. C. tit. 28,  346 (28 USCA  346; Comp. St.  1216).\n The certificate shows that, June 28, 1923, plaintiff in error complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission against defendants in error and others that during the preceding two years it shipped numerous carloads of news \n\n[275 U.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n print paper from Thorold, Ontario, to New York City and bore charges exacted by defendants in error based on through rates of 37 cents per hundredweight prior to July 1, 1922, and 33.5 cents thereafter, and that these rates and the portions thereof applicable to the transportation within the United States were excessive, unduly discriminatory and unjustly prejudicial in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.; Comp. St.  8563 et seq.); that the Commission found the rate in force between August 26, 1920, and July 1, 1922, unreasonable to the extent it exceeded 32 cents, and the rate thereafter applied unreasonable to the extent that it exceeded 29.5 cents, and that plaintiff in error suffered damages in respect of its shipments after July 2, 1921, in the amounts by which the charges were so found to be unreasonable and was entitled to reparation from the carriers that 'engaged in the transportation of those shipments within the United States.'\n The reports of the Commission set out in the certificate (95 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 66; 102 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 365) show that Thorold is a place in Ontario on the Canadian National Railways 30 miles from Black Rock, N. Y., where connection is made with the New York Central, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, and other lines, and 12 miles from Suspension Bridge, N. Y., where connection is made with the New York Central, Lehigh Valley, and other lines, and that Black Rock is 414 miles and Suspension Bridge is 447 miles from New York City. The rates complained of applied over several railroads from each of these junctions. No rates were made or published for the transportation from the international boundary to New York City. The Commission did not determine what would be just and reasonable rates for this transportation.\n The questions certified follow.\n\n 1. \nWhere a railroad of the United States and a railroad of the Dominion of Canada unite in the publication \n\n[275 U.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n of a joint through rate from a point within the Dominion of Canada to a point within the United States, the rate covering transportation both in Canada and in the United States, has the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States jurisdiction, on complaint of a shipper or consignee made against the United States railroad alone, to determine the reasonableness of such joint through rate?\n\n 2. \nWhere a shipper or consignee of freight shipped to it at a destination in the United States from such point in the Dominion of Canada has paid at destination to the United States railroad the full published joint through freight rate thereon, has the Interstate Commerce Commission, upon a finding by it that such joint through rate was unreasonable and unjust, but in the absence of a finding that the charges for the transportation in so far as it took place within the United States were unjust and unreasonable, jurisdiction to make an order for the payment of damages to such shipper or consignee in the amount that the entire transportation charges on the basis of the joint through freight rate exceeded the charges which would have been assessed on the basis of the joint through freight rate found by the Commission to have been reasonable?\n\n 3. \nWhen the Interstate Commerce Commission had made such an order against the United States carrier alone for the payment of damages arising from its finding of the unreasonableness of such published joint through rate, can a suit thereon, under section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act, be maintained solely against the United States carrier?\n\n 4. \nDid the district court err in sustaining the demurrer to the said petition?\n As to Question 1.-The Interstate Commerce Act applies to the lines that carried, and to the transportation of, the paper from the international boundary to New \n\n[275 U.S. 179, 187]\n\u00a0\n York City, Section 1(1) and (2).1 It was the duty of defendants in error to establish just and reasonable rates for that service. Section 1(5); section 6(1) and (7). They failed to make or publish any rate applicable to that part of the transportation. Section 8 makes them liable for damages sustained in consequence of such failure. Had the through rate been just and reasonable, no damages would have resulted to plaintiff in error. Its right to reparation does not depend upon the amounts retained by defendants in error pursuant to agreed divisions. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield Co., \n269 \nU.S. 217, 231\n, 46 S. Ct. 73. Their breach of the statutory duty was a proximate cause of the losses complained of. The failure to establish rates covering the transportation from the international boundary contravened the provisions of the act and compelled plaintiff in error to pay the through charges complained of. The Commission had jurisdiction to determine whether plaintiff in error was entitled to an 'award of damages under the provisions of this act for a violation thereof.' Section 16(1). And it was the duty of the Commission to ascertain the damages sustained. It is obvious that, in the ascertainment of damages, the Commission had jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the charges exacted.\n As to Question 2.-The Commission did not specifically find whether the portions of the charges fairly attributable to transportation within the United States were excessive to the extent that the through rates were found unreasonable. While the findings seem to indicate that the Commission held the entire excess should be charged against the American lines, we shall consider the question on the basis therein stated. The Canadian lines furnishing the transportation from Thorold to the international boundary were not before the Commission \n\n[275 U.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n and were not sued. The defendants in error participated in the making of the through rate and actually collected the excessive charges. By their failure to comply with the act, plaintiff in error was compelled to pay charges based on the through rates. On the facts stated, the Commission was authorized to hear the complaint, section 13(1); and had jurisdiction to make the order, section 16(1). The question should be answered in the affirmative.\n As to Question 3.-The statement of the case and what has been said as to questions 1 and 2 make it plain that this question should be answered in the affirmative.\n As to Question 4.-Section 239 authorizes the Circuit Court of Appeals to certify to this court 'any questions or propositions of law concerning which instructions are desired for the proper decision of the cause.' It is well settled that this statute does not authorize the lower court to make, or require this court to accept, a transfer of the case. The inquiry calls for decision of the whole case. It is not specific or confined to any distinct question or proposition of law, and therefore need not be answered. The Folmina, \n212 \nU.S. 354, 363\n, 29 S. Ct. 363, 15 Ann.

As required by the Revenue Act approved February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, the executors returned a schedule to the collector. He estimate the gross estate at $180,184.73 and allowed $77,747.74 deductions. They paid the amount assessed upon the balance. Their return did not include certain property transferred by the decedent through duly executed deeds and without valuable consideration, some to trustees and some directly to her children. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that under section 402(c), being Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 c, the value of all this property at her death must be included in the gross state. \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 533]\n\u00a0\n He raised the assessment accordingly and demanded the additional tax-$34, 662.65-here challenged.\n July 29, 1907, Mrs. Coolidge and her husbandowned certain real estate in Boston, also valuable personal property, which they transferred without consideration to trustees, who agreed to hold it any pay the income to the settlors, then to the survivor, and after his death to distribute the corpus among the settlors' five children or their representatives. The deed directed that the interest of any child predenceasing the survivor should pass as provided by the statute of distribution 'in effect at the time of the death of such survivor.' The trustees were authorized to sell the property, to make and change investments, etc. April 6, 1917, the settlors assigned to the children their entire interest in the property, especially any right to the income therefrom. At the death of Mrs. Coolidge the trustees held property worth $432,155.35, but through sales and changes much of what they originally received had passed from their possession.\n May 18, 1917, by deeds purporting to convey the fee Mrs. Coolidge-her husband joining-gave their five children two parcels of land long used by her for residences. Contemporaneously the grantees leased these parcels to the conveyors for one year at nominal rental, with provision for annual renewals until notice to the contrary. All parties understood that renewals would be made if either lessee wished to occupy the premises. When Mrs. Coolidge died the value of this property was $274,300.\n Plaintiff in error now maintains the above-described transfers by Mrs. Coolidge were intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, within the ambit of section 402(c), Act February 24, 1919, and that the value at her death of the property held by the conveyees constituted part of her gross estate.\n The court below held the transfer of the residences (1917) was absolute, the right to possess or enjoy them \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n did not depend upon death, and their value constituted no part of the gross estate; also that under the statute the value of the property conveyed to trustees in 1907, or resulting therefrom, must be included in the gross estate, but, thus construed, the act went beyond the power of Congress.\n Relevant portions of 'Title IV-Estate Tax,' Act February 24, 1919, are printed below. \n1\n It undertakes to \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n lay a charge equal to the sum of specified percentages-from 1 to 25-'of the value of the net estate ... upon the transfer of the net estate of every \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n decedent' dying thereafter. And it directs that the net estate shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross certain items and an exemption of $ 50,000; also 'that \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated'-\n\n\n (a)\n To the extent of his interest therein, subject to the payment of charges against the estate, expenses of administration, and subject to distribution. (b) The dower or curtesy, etc., interest of the surviving spouse. (c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act), except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth. (d) Any interest held jointly with another and payable to the survivor. (e) Property passing under a general power of appointment. (f) The excess over $40,000 of insurance taken out by the decedent upon his own life.\n Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61, 62\n, 44 S. Ct. 293, says of this tax:\n'This is not a tax upon a residue, it is a tax upon a transfer of his net estate by a decedent, a distinction marked by the words that we have quoted from the statute, and previously commented upon at lengh in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 49\n, 77 S., 20 S. Ct. 747. It comes into existence before and is independent of the receipt of the property by the legatee. It taxes, as Hansen, Death Duties, puts it in a passage cited in \n178 \nU.S. 49\n, 20 S. Ct. 751, 'not the interest to which some person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceased by reason of the death.\"\n\n Y. M. C. A. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 47, 50\n, 44 S. Ct. 291:\n'What was being imposed here (Act February 24, 1919) was an excise upon the transfer of an estate upon death of the owner.' \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n Concerning transfer of the residences in 1917, the trial court charged\n\n'I do not have much difficulty in reaching a conclusion respecting the deeds of the Boston and Brookline real estate, and I will first consider the claim of the parties respecting those transfers.\n\n'The deeds conveyed, with warranty covenants, absolute and indefeasible title to the real estate without any valid reservations, conditions, or restrictions whatsoever.\n\n'The leases, executed the same day, were for one year or any renewal thereof, but were always subject to the right in the lessors to terminate the term during any year by giving the notice as therein provided. It is conceded that the parties contemplated that the premises would be enjoyed by the decedent and her husband so long as they might desire to use them for residential purposes, but the decedent had no valid agreement to that effect. Her rights must be held to be governed by the terms of the lease. If it could be said that the grantee did not come into full possession and enjoyment of the estate at the time of the conveyances-and I am inclined to the opinion that they did-their right to come into full possession did not depend in the slightest degree upon the death of the grantor. The effect of this transaction was to vest in the five sons named in the deed full and complete title to the property including the right of disposition. They had a right to sell the property subject to the lease, and had all rights incident to ownership. There was here a gift completed during the lifetime of the donor. The act of 1918 did not purport to tax such gifts.\n\n'I have reached the conclusion, therefore, that respecting the property conveyed by the deed the facts of this case do not bring the property within the reach of the statute, and that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 539]\n\u00a0\n was without authority to include the value of it as a part of the gross estate. I therefore give the following instructions, as requested by the plaintiffs: The real estate referred to in the second count of the declaration was not a part of the net estate of Julia Coolidge within the meaning of the Revenue Act of 1918.'\n\n We agree with this conclusion and accept as adequate the reasons advanced to support it.\n Counsel for the United States argue that the challenged subsection only undertakes to tax the transfer from the dead and merely uses the gross estate to measure the charge. Taken together, sections 402, 408 and 409 disclose definite purpose to do much more than tax this transfer.\n Section 402 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 c) directs that the gross estate shall be ascertained by including (among other things) the value at his death of all property-\n'to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act), except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth.'\n\n The language of this section inhibits the conclusion that only subsequent transfers are to be included. Under Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238, 251\n, 45 S. Ct. 487, 6. L. Ed. 934, only such transfers come within section 402(f), Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 536\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454, confined section 202(b), Act September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 777-prototypes of section 402(c), Act 1919-to subsequent transfers. The emphatic words 'whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act,' added by the latter act, evidently were intended to exclude a like construction.\n Section 408 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 i) authorizes an executor to recover from one who receives life insurance 'such portion of the total tax paid as the proceeds, in excess of $40,000, of such policies \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 540]\n\u00a0\n bear to the net estate.' Section 409 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 j) imposes a lien to secure the tax upon the gross estate; and provides:\n'If (a) the decedent makes a transfer of, or creates a trust with respect to, any property in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (except in the case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth) or (b) if insurance passes under a contract executed by the decedent in favor of a specific beneficiary, and if in either case the tax in respect thereto is not paid when due, then the transferee, trustee, or beneficiary shall be personally liable for such tax, and such property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein at the time of such transfer, or to the extent of such beneficiary's interest under such contract of insurance, shall be subject to a like lien equal to the amount of such tax.'\n\n For the United States it is said that the imposition under consideration is an exercise of the federal taxing power and is imposed upon a transmission of property by death. Also, that what Congress intended was to provide a measure for the tax which would operate equally upon all those who made testamentary dispositions of their property, whether this was by will or intestacy or only testamentary in effect; the immediate purpose was not to prevent evasions, for the statute applies to transactions completed when there was none to be evaded. And the conclusion is that the measure adopted is reasonable, since the specified transactions are testamentary in effect.\n But the conveyance by Mrs. Coolidge to trustees was in no proper sense testamentary, and it bears no substantial relationship to the transfer by death. The mere desire to equalize taxation cannot justify a burden on something not within congressional power. The language of the statute is not consistent with the idea that it utilizes the gross estate merely to measure a proper \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 541]\n\u00a0\n charge upon the transfer by death. See Lewellyn v. Frick, supra; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 494\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 606 (69 L. Ed. 1058, 42 A. L. R. 316) rejected a somewhat similar claim, and said:\n'Of course, this was but the equivalent of saying that it was admissible to measure the tax by a standard which took no account of the distinction between what the state had power to tax and what it had no power to tax, and which necessarily operated to make the amount of the tax just what it would have been had the state's power included what was excluded by the Constitution. This ground, in our opinion, is not tenable. It would open the way for easily doing indirectly what is forbidden to be done directly, and would render important constitutional limitations of no avail.'\n\n The exaction is not a succession tax like the one sustained by Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331; Keeney v. New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525\n, 32 S. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139. The right to become beneficially entitled is not the occasion for it. There is no claim that the transfers were made in contemplation of death or with purpose to evade taxation. The provision applicable in such circumstances is not relied on and the extent of congressional power to prevent evasion or defeat of duly imposed exactions need not be discussed.\n Certainly Congress may lay an excise upon the transfer of property by death reckoned upon the value of the interest which passes thereby. But under the mere guise of reaching something within its powers Congress may not lay a charge upon what is beyond them. Taxes are very real things and statutes imposing them are estimated by practical results.\n As the executors paid the contested charge out of property which actually passed by death, only their rights are here involved. If the fund held by them had been insufficient and payment had been exacted from others, somewhat different questions might require consideration. Lewellyn v. Frick, supra.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 531, 542]\n\u00a0\n The statute requires the executors to pay an excise ostensibly laid upon transfer of property by death from Mrs. Coolidge to them but reckoned upon its value plus the value of other property conveyed before the enactment in entire good faith and without contemplation of death. Is the statute, thus construed, within the power of Congress?\n Undoubtedly, Congress may require that property subsequently transferred in contemplation of death be treated as part of the estate for purposes of taxation. This is necessary to prevent evasion and give practical effect to the exercise of admitted power, but the right is limited by the necessity.\n Under the theory advanced for the United States, the arbitrary, whimsical and burdensome character of the challenged tax is plain enough. An excise is prescribed, but the amount of it is made to depend upon past lawful transactions, not testamentary in character and beyond recall. Property of small value transferred before death may have become immensely valuable, and the estate tax, swollen by this, may leave nothing for distribution. Real estate transferred years ago, when of small value, may be worth an enormous sum at the death. If the deceased leaves no estate there can be no tax; if, on the other hand, he leaves ten dollars both that and the real estate become liable. Different estates must bear disproportionate burdens determined by what the deceased did one or twenty years before he died. See Frew v. Bowers, Collector (C. C. A.) 12 F. (2d) 625.\n This court has recognized that a statute purporting to tax may be so arbitrary and capricious as to amount to confiscation and offend the Fifth Amendment. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348. See, also, Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 77\n, 20 S. Ct. 747. And we must conclude that section 402(c) \n\n[274 U.S. 531, 543]\n\u00a0\n of the statute here under consideration, in so far as it requires that there shall be included in the gross estate the value of property transferred by a decedent prior to its passage merely because the conveyance was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, is arbitrary, capricious and amounts to confiscation. Whether or how far the challenged provision is valid in respect of transfers made subsequent to the enactment, we need not now consider.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice SANFORD, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 401. That (in lieu of the tax imposed by title II of the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended, and in lieu of the tax imposed by title IX of the Revenue Act of 1917) a tax equal to the sum of the following percentages of the value of the net estate (determined as provided in section 403) is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this act, whether a resident or nonresident of the United States: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] per centum of the amount of the net estate not in excess of $50,000; \n[\nFootnote 2\n] per centum of the amount by which the net estate exceeds $50,000 and does not exceed $150,000; \n[\nFootnote 3\n] per centum of the amount by which the not estate exceeds $150,000 and does not exceed $250,000; \n[\nFootnote 4\n] per centum of the amount by which the net estate exceeds $250,000 and does not exceed $450,000; \n[\nFootnote 6\n] per centum of the amount by which the net estate exceeds $450,000 and does not exceed $750,000; ... \n[\nFootnote 25\n] per centum of the amount by which the net estate exceeds $10,000, 000.\n Sec. 402. That the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated-\n (a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration and is subject to distribution as part of his estate;\n (b) To the extent of any interest therein of the surviving spouse, existing at the time of the decedent's death as dower, courtesy, or by virtue of a statute creating an estate in lieu of dower or courtesy;\n (c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to takess \n effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act), except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title;\n (d) To the extent of the interest therein held jointly or as tenants in the entirety by the decedent and any other person, or deposited in banks or other institutions in their joint names and payable to either or the survivor, except such part thereof as may be shown to have originally belonged to such other person and never to have belonged to the decedent;\n (e) To the extent of any property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, or (2) by deed executed in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth; and\n (f) To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.\n Sec. 403. That for the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined-\n (a) In the case of a resident, by deducting from the value of the gross estate (specified items and an exemption of $50,000).\n Sec. 408. If the tax or any part thereof is paid by, or collected out of that part of the estate passing to or in the possession of, any person other than the executor in his capacity as such, such person shall be entitled to reimbursement out of any part of the estate still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution by the persons whose interest in the estate of the decedent would have been reduced if the tax had been paid before the distribution of the estate or whose interest is subject to equal or prior liability for the payment of taxes, debts, or other charges against the estate, it being \n the purpose and intent of this title that so far as is practicable and unless otherwise If any part of the gross estate consists of proceeds be paid out of the estate before its distribution. If any part of the gross estate consists of proceeds of policies of insurance upon the life of the decedent receivable by a beneficiary other than the executor, the executor shall be entitled to recover from such beneficiary such portion of the total tax paid as the proceeds, in excess of $40,000, of such policies bear to the net estate. If there is more than one such beneficiary the executor shall be entitled to recover from such beneficiaries in the same ratio.\n Sec. 409. That unless the tax is sooner paid in full, it shall be a lien for ten years upon the gross estate of the decedent, except that such part of the gross estate as is used for the payment of charges against the estate and expenses of its administration, allowed by any court having jurisdiction thereof, shall be divested of such lien. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax liability of an estate has been fully discharged or provided for, he may, under regulations prescribed by him with the approval of the Secretary, issue his certificate releasing any or all property of such estate from the lien herein imposed.\n If (a) the decedent makes a transfer of, or creates a trust with respect to, any property in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (except in the case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth) or (b) if insurance passes under a contract executed by the decedent in favor of a specific beneficiary, and if in either case the tax in respect thereto is not paid when due, then the transferee, trustee, or beneficiary shall be personally liable for such tax, and such property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein at the time of such transfer, or to the extent of such beneficiary's interest under such contract of insurance, shall be subject to a like lien equal to the amount of such tax. Any part of such property sold by such transferee or trustee to a bona fide purchaser for a fair consideration in money or money's worth shall be divested of the lien and a like lien shall then attach to all the property of such transferee or trustee, except any part sold to a bona fide purchaser for a fair consideration in money or money's worth.\n Comp.

Louis Marshall, of New York City, F. C. Knollenberg, of El Paso, Tex., A. B. Spingarn, of New York City, R. J. Channell, of El Paso, Tex., Moorfield Storey, of Boston, Mass., and James A.

Simmons, both of Austin, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action against the Judges of Elections for refusing to permit the plaintiff to vote at a primary election in Texas. It lays the damages at five thousand dollars. The petition alleges that the plaintiff is a negro, a citizen of the United States and of Texas and a resident of El Paso, and in every way qualified to vote, as set forth in detail, except that the statute to be mentioned interferes with his right; that on July 26, 1924, a primary election was held at El Paso for the nomination of candidates for a senator and representatives in Congress and State and other offices, upon the Democratic ticket; that \n\n[273 U.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff, being a member of the Democratic party, sought to vote but was denied the right by defendants; that the denial was based upon a statute of Texas enacted in May, 1923 (Acts 38th Leg. 2d Called Sess. ( 1923) c. 32,  1 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. 1925, art. 3107)), and designated article 3093a, by the words of which 'in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election held in the State of Texas,' etc., and that this statute is contrary to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The defendants moved to dismiss upon the ground that the subject-matter of the suit was political and not within the jurisdiction of the Court and that no violation of the Amendments was shown. The suit was dismissed and a writ of error was taken directly to this Court. Here no argument was made on behalf of the defendants but a brief was allowed to be filed by the Attorney General of the State.\n The objection that the subject-matter of the suit is political is little more than a play upon words. Of course the petition concerns political action but it alleges and seeks to recover for private damage. That private damage may be caused by such political action and may be recovered for in suit at law hardly has been doubted for over two hundred years, since Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 3 Ld. Raym. 320, and has been recognized by this Court. Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 \nU.S. 58, 64\n, 65 S., 21 S. Ct. 17; Giles v. Harris, \n189 \nU.S. 475, 485\n, 23 S. Ct. 639. See also Judicial Code,  24(11), (12), (14); Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231; 36 Stat. 1087, 1092 (Comp. St.  991). If the defendants' conduct was a wrong to the plaintiff the same reasons that allow a recovery for denying the plaintiff a vote at a final election allow it for denying a vote at the primary election that may determine the final result.\n The important question is whether the statute can be sustained. But although we state it as a question the answer does not seem to us open to a doubt. We find it unnecessary to consider the Fifteenth Amendment, be- \n\n[273 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n cause it seems to us hard to imagine a more direct and obvious infringement of the Fourteenth. That Amendment, while it applies to all, was passed, as we know, with a special intent to protect the blacks from discrimination against them. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36; Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 U.S. 303\n. That Amendment 'not only gave citizenship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color, but it denied to any State the power to withhold from them the equal protection of the laws. ... What is this but declaring that the law in the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color?' Quoted from the last case in Buchanan v. Warley, \n245 \nU.S. 60, 77\n, 38 S. Ct. 16, 19 (62 L. Ed. 149, L. R. A. 1918C, 210, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1201). See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 374\n, 6 S. Ct. 1064. The statute of Texas in the teeth of the prohibitions referred to assumes to forbid negroes to take part in a primary election the importance of which we have indicated, discriminating against them by the distinction of color alone. States may do a good deal of classifying that it is difficult to believe rational, but there are limits, and it is too clear for extended argument that color cannot be made the basis of a statutory classification affecting the right set up in this case.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN RY. CO. v. PAGE(1927)\nNo. 136\nArgued: January 17, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 65, 66]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert G. Dodge, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles F. Perkins, of Boston, Mass., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the District Court of Massachusetts by Michael B. Ryan against the petitioner and the United Fruit Company, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him, February 23, 1918, in Costa Rica, while a passenger on a railway train alleged to have been operated by both companies. A verdict was directed for the fruit company. No question as to its \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n liability is presented here. We may refer to the railway company as the defendant.\n On the day before plaintiff was hurt, a small insurrection broke out in a part of Costa Rica west of San Jose, the capital. Plaintiff was traveling on the regular morning passenger train running easterly from that city to Port Limon on the Atlantic Coast. At Turrialba, about 65 miles from Port Limon, the train was held up by insurrectos. Its seizure was reported to the Governor at Port Limon, and he sent out a train containing government troops. After detention for some hours, the passenger train was allowed to go. The railroad is a single-track line having sidings at various places. Both trains were given orders to meet at La Pascua. The passenger train was the first to arrive at that place, and went upon the side track to let the troop train pass. The officers of the troop train gave an order to, and the troops did, fire upon the passenger cars. Some passengers were killed and others, including the plaintiff, were seriously injured.\n At the close of the evidence, the District Judge, doubting whether there was anything to show negligence on the part of the defendant, submitted the case to the jury; and, in accordance with the practice in Massachusetts and that federal district, directed the jury that, if they found for the plaintiff, they should also return an alternative verdict for defendant, which could be entered if later it should be held as a matter of law that plaintiff was not entitled to recover. General Laws of Massachusetts, c. 231,  120; Automatic Pencil Sharpener Co. v. Boston Pencil Pointer Co. (C. C. A.) 279 F. 40. The jury gave plaintiff a verdict for $25,000, and made the alternative finding as directed. Afterwards, on motion of the defendant, the District Judge set aside the verdict for plaintiff and entered the alternative verdict. He held that there was no evidence to support a finding against defendant. Subsequently plaintiff died; his administrators were made parties, and judgment \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n was entered for defendant. The case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court vacated the judgment of the District Court, set aside the verdict for defendant, and remanded the case, with directions to reinstate the verdict and give judgment for plaintiffs. 3 F.(2d) 747. This court granted defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 542\n, 46 S. Ct. 19.\n At the trial, plaintiff called a witness familiar with Costa Rica law. He testified, in substance: One who through his fault causes injury to another is bound to make reparation. If a corporation is to be held, the negligence must be that of a person who stands in position of representative. One in immediate charge of a train is held to be the representative of the railroad company for the purpose of that operation. The rule that a high degree of care is owed by a railroad carrier to its passengers does not prevail in that country. The duty owed is uniform. It is the care exercised by a diligent head of a family-a prudent and diligent person who is his own master. In the absence of negligence on the part of the carrier, it is not liable for injuries sustained by passengers. The witness cited sections 1045 and 1048 of the Code of Costa Rica. Plaintiff sought recovery on the ground that defendant knew that the troops had reasonable cause to believe that the passenger train was transporting armed hostile forces, and failed seasonably and adequately to inform the government troops and their officers that there were no insurrectos on the passenger train.\n There is little or no controversy as to the facts. The passenger train left San Jose at 8 in the morning and was due at Port Limon at 4:30 in the afternoon. It consisted of locomotive, five freight cars, a combination baggage and second-class passenger car, one or two first-class coaches, and a pay car carrying gold, silver, and express parcels. Ramsay was the conductor; he and other members of the crew were regular employees of defendant. \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n The passengers were men, women, and children-some natives and some foreigners. The train arrived at Turrialba at half after 11. There the insurrectos held it up and searched for persons connected with the government. One was taken on suspicion, but no one else was molested. The officers in command gave assurance that the train would be detained only while the insurrectos used the engine to destory track between that place and San Jose. About a quarter before 6, the train was allowed to go. As it was leaving, an officer ordered some insurrectos to go and blow up the bridge at Torito, which is about two miles east of Turrialba. When the train arrived at Torito all the insurrectos got off. The train went to Peralta four or five miles further on, where the conductor received an order to pass a special train at La Pascua, which was five or six miles ahead. No information was given him that this was the train carrying troops. That train left Port Limon about half after 3. It was also in charge of regular employees of the defendant. The train crew and the officers in command of the troops knew that the passenger train had been held up by the insurrectos. The troops were ordered to Turrialba to meet the rebels. At Las Lomas orders were received to pass an extra or special train at La Pascua about six miles west. The troop train arrived at La Pascua about 7 o'clock.\n We quote from the record:\n'Grant, a witness called for the plaintiff, testified on direct examination as follows: 'When the cars came close enough you could see guns sticking out of the window in perfect alignment, and see troops standing on the steps; ... I believe somebody on the ground, Mr. Ramsay or Mr. Veitch or somebody else there, mentioned that it was a troop train going up to attack these revolutionists.' When the locomotive of the troop train arrived opposite the combination baggage and pas- \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 70]\n\u00a0\n senger car, Ramsay flagged it, and told the engineer to look out for the Torito bridge where he had left revolutionists, that he would probably find it torn up. Two officers then alighted from the troop train, and one said to Ramsay, 'What train is this?' ... he replied that it was the regular passenger train from San Jose to Limon. He told the officer in English and then in Spanish that there were no revolutionists on board. Ramsay testified that he knew the officer by sight, as he had traveled on his train before. At the same time the other officer was speaking to one Veitch. ... He asked Veitch what the train was, and Veitch replied that it was the passenger train from San Jose to Limon, and that there were no revolutionists on board. Veitch had been an importer and banana grower in Costa Rico for eleven years prior to 1918, and was then consular agent for the Italian government. Ramsay then signaled his train to proceed; the officers demanded that it be halted, which was done. The troop train then began to move forward, the officers walking beside it. When the passenger cars of the troop train were approximately opposite the passenger coaches of the passenger train, and while the troop train was still in motion, although coming to a stop, one of the officers raised his sword and waved it, and an order to fire was given. Immediately the firing began by the troops, some kneeling in the car with their guns extending out of the windows about three feet, and some on the platforms.'\n\n The record contains nothing that in any material or substantial particular conflicts with that account of what there occurred. In fact, it is supported by the testimony given by plaintiff in his own behalf. He said: The passenger train went upon the siding at La Pascua and was there five or ten minutes before the troop train arrived. He remained in the coach. Some of the passengers got off the train and walked about. When the troop \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 71]\n\u00a0\n train first stopped, the engines were about opposite each other. He saw Conductor Ramsay and the officers in command of the troops talking, but did not hear what they said. There was nothing to indicate that any one was alarmed or expected trouble. The troop train pulled up and stopped so that a troop car was opposite plaintiff's car. The weather was warm, and the windows of the passenger cars were open. There was nothing to indicate that it was other than an ordinary passenger train. There had been no sign of hostility. The troops, lined up in their car, fired into the windows of the passenger cars. There were about twenty passengers in plaintiff's car; some were in the aisle, and some were looking out the windows. And plaintiff testified that it was light enough so that one could see a considerable distance; that, when the troop train first stopped, he could see Conductor Ramsay apparently talking to the officers in charge of the troops. 'That would be probably 100, 150, maybe 200 feet. I don't remember. It was the full length of the train. We were pretty nearly back.' He said that it was light enough for him to see Ramsay and the officers at that distance; and, although it was dusk at the time, there was good visibility up to 200 feet.\n Veitch, called as a witness for defendant, testified that, when the troop train stopped and while Ramsay was talking to one of the officers, he talked to the other officer, and told him that it was a passenger train from San Jose to Port Limon and that there were no revolutionists on board. Later he heard this officer give command to the troops to fire, and firing began immediately. He stood there until he saw guns pointed at him, and then went under the train; they put two bullets through his clothes and two through a valise he was carrying; and he saw them shoot and kill a man who was leaning out of a coach window.\n On the day of the shooting, the general manager of the company was at its offices at Port Limon. He testi- \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 72]\n\u00a0\n fied that, when he learned that the insurrectos had held up the train, he notified the Governor, who was also at Port Limon, and that, when he learned the insurrectos were ready to release the train, he so informed the Governor, and the latter instructed him to move the passenger train; that he reminded the Governor that there was a troop train on the line; 'I told him he had better notify the troop train; he said he would; afterwards he said he did.' And the general manager testified that he promptly telephoned to the yardmaster at Siquirres, a station east of Las Lomas, to get word to the conductor of the troop train that the passenger train was carrying noncombatants including women and children. The railway superintendent testified that he notified the Governor of the release of the passenger train, and asked and procured authority to move it to Port Limon. The assistant train dispatcher, who came on duty at 5 o'clock, testified that about a quarter after 5 Ramsay reported that the train had been released, and later reported from Peralta that all of the revolutionists had got off at Torito to destroy a bridge; that, when the troop train was at Siquirres, he notified the conductor that the passenger train had been released and that 'meet orders' would be given later; that he communicated with the troop train at Las Lomas that the other train had no revolutionists aboard, and gave orders to pass it at La Pascua.\n The burden was on plaintiff to show that defendant's negligence, as specified above, was the proximate cause of his injuries. Under familiar rules, plaintiff was entitled to prevail if the evidence and the inferences that a jury might legitimately draw from it were fairly and reasonably sufficient to warrant a finding in his favor. Otherwise the judgment must be for defendant. C., M. & St. P. Ry. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 478\n, 46 S. Ct. 564, and cases cited. The verdict cannot be sustained if essential facts \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 73]\n\u00a0\n are left in the realm of conjecture and speculation. St. Louis, etc., Ry. v. Mills, \n271 \nU.S. 344, 347\n, 46 S. Ct. 520.\n The record does not include or purport to contain all the evidence. It does not show that Ramsay failed to testify as to what he said to the officers in command of the troops before the order to fire was given. It shows that he testified that, when the shooting began, he called out to the troops that they were firing on passengers, and that there were no revolutionists on the train. And, in the paragraph quoted, the bill of exceptions shows that plaintiff's witness Grant testified that, when Ramsay flagged the troop train, he told one of the officers that his was the regular passenger train, and that there were no revolutionists on board. In the opinion of the majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals it is said (page 752):\n'The jury might have found that, inasmuch as Ramsay, the conductor, did not testify as to what he said to the officers in charge of the troops prior to the shooting, but did testify that when the shooting began be cried out that there (were) no revolutionists on the train, nothing of the kind was said until after the shooting began; that the troops and their officers never received any information as to the harmless character of the occupants of the train, or received it too late and under such circumstances as to render it unavailable.'\n\n This view cannot be sustained. There was no basis for the court's assumption. There was nothing reasonably to warrant the rejection of Grant's testimony. Indeed, plaintiff's own testimony tended to corroborate Grant. And the District Judge in charging the jury assumed as an undisputed fact that, when the train stopped, the officers were informed by Ramsay and Veitch that there were no revolutionists on the train. The case having been so put to the jury, it is to be assumed that they considered the matter on that basis. Defendant was not required \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 74]\n\u00a0\n to satisfy the jury that it was not guilty of the negligence alleged against it. If Ramsay had not testified at all, his failure so to do could not be taken as substantive evidence of any fact. If, instead of showing that Ramsay had told the officers that no insurrectos were on his train, plaintiff had put in testimony that no such information had been given to the government forces, and then Ramsay had remained silent, it would have been permissible to draw an inference that he was not in position to assert the contrary. But that is not the situation here presented. Tully v. Fitchburg Railroad, 134 Mass. 499, 502; Poirier v. Terceiro, 224 Mass. 435, 437, 113 N. E. 204; W. F. Corbin & Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 181 F. 296, 304; Owens Bottle-Machine Co. v. Kanawha Banking & Trust Co. (C. C. A .) 259 F. 838, 842. There is nothing to support a finding that the officers in charge of the troops were not informed at La Pascua before the order to fire was given that there were no insurrectos on the passenger train. The record discloses no reason for rejecting the testimony of Grant and Veitch. It is to be taken as established that such information was given.\n And, assuming that a jury properly might decline to believe the testimony of defendant's officials going to show that the troop train and officers in charge had been so informed before they left Las Lomas, actionable negligence was not made out. There was no evidence that the officers in charge of the troops had any reason to believe that the train they were directed to meet at La Pascua was then carrying insurrectos. Even if there was evidence that they had ground for such belief and that defendant failed to take some precaution, there is nothing to show that such failure caused plaintiff's injuries. If the direct and positive information as to the harmless character of the train given on the spot by Ramsay and Veitch was not \n\n[274 U.S. 65, 75]\n\u00a0\n sufficient, it must be deemed a matter of speculation and conjecture whether any information that defendant could have given would have prevented the shooting. St. Louis, etc., Ry. v. Mills, supra, 347 (46 S. Ct. 520). The mere fact that the troops shot into the passenger train does not tend to show that defendant was at fault. And, when regard is had to the facts and circumstances shown by uncontradicted evidence, it is clear that the shooting was an occurrence that could not reasonably have been anticipated or foreseen as the natural and probable result of any failure of defendant earlier or otherwise to inform the government forces that there was no insurrectos on the passenger train. It follows that there is no ground on which defendant can be held liable for the injuries inflicted on plaintiff by the government forces. Scheffer v. Railroad Co., \n105 U.S. 249\n, 252; Milwaukee, etc., Railway Co. v. Kellogg, \n94 U.S. 469\n, 475; American Bridge Co. v. Seeds (C. C. A.) 144 F. 605, 609, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1041; Jarnagin v. Travelers' Protective Ass'n (C. C. A.) 133 F. 892, 896, 68 L. R. A. 499; Cole v. German Savings & Loan Soc. (C. C. A.) 124 F. 113, 63 L. R. A. 416.\n In his memorandum on the motion to set aside the verdict, the trial judge said:\n'I am unable to discover in the evidence anything on which a finding of negligence can be supported, or to say, even after the event, in what the defendant's agents and servants failed. The jury might, of course, reject the testimony of the defendant's witnesses; but that would not supply evidence of negligence on the defendant's part. The attack took place, apparently, because the officers in command of the troops lost their heads and behaved with incredible folly. It was an extraordinary occurrence, which the defendant had no reason to anticipate, and for which it is not liable.'\n\n The record fully sustains that statement.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHWESTERN MUT. LIFE INS. CO. v. STATE OF WISCONSIN(1927)\nNo. 75\nArgued: October 27, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sam T. Swansen and George Lines, both of Milwaukee, Wis ., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Franklin Bump, of Madison, Wis., for the State of Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two causes, originally brought in the circuit court of Dane county, present the same question. The plaintiff company, a corporation under the laws of Wisconsin, has long carried on therein the business of insuring lives. It seeks to recover excess taxes exacted by the state for the five years, 1918-1923. The courts below held that the exaction was proper under section 76.34, Wisconsin Statutes 1923 (section 1211.35, Stat. 1919; section 51.32, Stat. 1917). And they definitely denied the contention that so construed and applied the statute conflicted with the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n Section 76.34 provides:\n'Life Insurance Companies to Pay Annual License. Every company, corporation or association transacting the business of life insurance within this state, excepting only such fraternal societies as have lodge organizations and insure the lives of their own members, and no others, shall, on or before the first day of March, in each year, pay into the state treasury as an annual license fee for transacting such business the amounts following:\n\n'(1) Domestic Companies; Three per Cent. of Gross Income. If such company, corporation or association is organized under the laws of this state, three per centum of its gross income from all sources for the year ending December thirty-first, next prior to said first day of March excepting therefrom income from rents of real estate upon which said company, corporation or association has said the taxes assessed thereon, and excepting also premiums collected on policies of insurance and contracts for annuities. ...\n\n'(3) Power Granted by License; License Fee in Lieu of Other Taxes. Such license, when granted shall author- \n\n[275 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n ize the company, corporation or association to whom it is issued to transact business until the first day of March of the ensuing year, unless sooner revoked or forfeited. The payment of such license fee shall be in lieu of all taxes for any purpose authorized by the laws of this state, except taxes on such real estate as may be owned by such company, corporation or association.'\n\n In annual reports the company disclosed all receipts derived from interest on United States bonds and claimed they were exempt from taxation under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The revenue officers acted upon another view, and both courts below have held that they rightly disregarded the source of the receipts and properly assessed sums reckoned upon the company's entire gross income.\n Counsel for the state maintain that the effect of section 76.34 is to impose upon domestic insurance companies a privilege or franchise tax, and not one on property or income; that no charge is laid upon bonds of the United States, but the fee exacted is for granted privileges, including exemption from personal property taxation and right to do business; that the state may require domestic corporations to pay privilege, franchise or license taxes measured by gross income, although partly derived from United States bonds; and that in no proper sense can the challenged tax be regarded as one directly imposed upon gross income.\n They also suggest that this court has interpreted the statute and pointed out its real nature. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. State of Wisconsin, \n247 \nU.S. 132, 137\n, 38 S. Ct. 444. Speaking there of this same statute we did declare:\n'The tax in question is, therefore, not only one for the privilege of doing life insurance business within the state, but is in effect a commutation tax, levied by the state in place of all other taxation upon the personal property of \n\n[275 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n the company in the state of Wisconsin.'\n\n But no question was then raised concerning taxation of income derived from United States bonds. The point now presented was not involved.\n It cannot be denied (and denial is not attempted) that bonds of the United States are beyond the taxing power of the states. Home Savings Bank v. City of Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 509\n, 27 S. Ct. 571; Farmers & Mechanics Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516\n, 34 S. Ct. 354; and First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 347\n, 46 S. Ct. 135. Certainly since Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S. Ct. 171, it has been the settled doctrine here that where the principal is absolutely immune, no valid tax can be laid upon income arising therefrom. To tax this would amount practically to laying a burden on the exempted principal. Accordingly if the challenged act, whatever called, really imposes a direct charge upon interest derived from United States bonds, it is pro tanto void.\n The fundamental question often presented in cases similar to these, is whether by the true construction of the statute the assessment must be regarded as a tax upon property or one on privileges or franchise of the corporation. Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593\n\n\n Section 76.34 undertakes to impose a charge not measured by dividends paid, as in Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 595, nor by net income, as in Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; and those cases are not controlling The distinction between an imposition the amount of which depends upon dividends or net receipts and one measured by gross returns is clear. U. S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 328\n, 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748, and earlier opinions there cited.\n It is important to observe that, although a state statute may properly impose a charge which materially affects in- \n\n[275 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n terstate commerce without so unreasonable burdening it as to become a regulation within the meaning of the Constitution, no state can lay any charge on bonds of the United States. This distinction was adverted to in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S. Ct. 171, and the principle found application in Choctaw & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27, and Indian Territory Ill. Oil. Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S. Ct. 453. The power to tax property necessary to the conduct of interstate commerce has been often upheld, and without doubt the states by apt enactments may tax the ordinary property, franchises or business of their own corporations.\n A taxing act which requires payment of a certain percentage of the gross earnings of an interstate carrier, but which practically imposes no more than the ordinary charge upon local property, may be sustained. U. S. Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n, 32 S. Ct. 211, Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S. Ct. 373. But if the enactment goes further, and burdens property beyond the state, as in Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275\n, 39 S. Ct. 276, or amounts to a direct imposition upon interstate commerce itself, as in Galveston R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217\n, 28 S. Ct. 638, or lays an impost upon exports, as in Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S. Ct. 126, it violates the federal Constitution.\n Here the statute undertook to impose a charge of 3 per cent. upon every dollar of interest received by the company from United States bonds. So much, in any event, the state took from these very receipts. This amounts, we think, to an imposition upon the bonds themselves and goes beyond the power of the state.\n The judgment below is reversed, and the cause will be remanded to the Supreme Court of the state of Wisconsin for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO PUBLIC SERVICE CO. v. STATE OF OHIO(1927)\nNo. 210\nArgued: March 10, 1927Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Carl H. Henkel, of Mansfield, Ohio, Frank M. Cobb, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Franklin L. Maier, of Massillon, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Lyman R. Critchfield and Alton H. Etling, both of Wooster, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two writs of error were sued out at different stages of the same cause-the first while a timely application for rehearing was pending; the second after this \n\n[274 U.S. 12, 13]\n\u00a0\n had been denied. Under the circumstances, plaintiff in error may rely upon the latter writ, and No. 210 will be dismissed.\n By an action in quo warranto, the state of Ohio, upon relation of the prosecuting attorney for Wayne county, seeks to oust plaintiff in error, a corporation under her laws, from use of the streets in the village of Orrville. The corporation has general power to transmit and distribute electric energy and current, and claims the privilege to operate there as assignee of rights granted to Gans & Wilson and their successors, by an ordinance of the village council passed February 1, 1892\n\n\n The Supreme Court treated the judgment of the Court of Appeals as establishing that the Orrville Light, Heat & Power Company, immediate successor to Gans & Wilson, acquired in 1893 the right to occupy the streets which the ordinance of 1892 gave them. But it held the franchise so acquired was revocable ten years after the original grant, and had been terminated by appropriate village action; also, that, under the act of the Legislature passed April 21, 1896 (92 Ohio Laws, 204), this franchise could not lawfully be assigned to plaintiff in error's predecessor during 1907 without the consent of the village, which was not given. It accordingly affirmed the judgment of ouster pronounced by the Court of Appeals. 113 Ohio St. 325, 149 N. E. 129.\n The Ordinance of February 1, 1892, ordained:\n'Sec. 1. That Aurel P. Gans and Mellville D. Wilson of Canal Dover, Ohio, their associates, successors, and assigns, are hereby authorized and empowered to use the streets, lanes, alleys, and avenues of the village of Orrville for the purpose of erecting, maintaining, and operating electric light wire mains and apparatus complete for the distribution of electricity for light, heat, and power.'\n\n Subsequent sections inhibited unnecessary obstruction of the streets, directed how the wires should be strung, \n\n[274 U.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n etc.; also that the grantee should furnish, and the village should use and pay for, a designated number of lights during a period of ten years, at a specified rate, etc.\n The Ohio statute of 1896 applies to electric light and power companies, and provides, that:\n'In order to subject the same to municipal control alone, no person or company shall place, string, construct or maintain any line, wire fixture or appliance of any kind for conducting electricity for lighting, heating or power purposes through any street, alley, lane, square, place or land of any city, village or town, without the consent of such municipality. ...'\n\n We think it quite clear that the conclusions of the court below conflict with rulings heretofore announced by this court.\n In Northern Ohio Traction Co. v. Ohio, \n245 \nU.S. 574\n, 38 S. Ct. 196, L. R. A. 1918E, 865, we pointed out the state of the law in Ohio during 1892. It is plain enough from what was there said that in our view the franchise originally granted by the village of Orrville was for an unlimited time and not subject to termination at the mere will of the grantor.\n Louisville v. Cumberland Telephone Co., \n224 \nU.S. 649, 661\n, 32 S. Ct. 572, and Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone Co., \n230 \nU.S. 58, 75\n, 33 S. Ct. 988, are enough to show that the rights acquired under the ordinance of 1892 were assignable without further consent by the village. If to enforce the Ohio Statute of 1896 would destroy this right, it conflicts with the provision of the federal Constitution (article 1,  10), no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissent. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOIL FIELDS CORPORATION v.

The motions are joined in by the counsel of record for the appellant and by the appellees. They show that the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company was a corporation of the state of Oklahoma organized in the Indian Territory in October, 1906, to have existence for 20 years, and that its charter would have expired by legal limitation in October, 1926; that about September 15, 1926, after the appeals in these cases were allowed, the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, was reorganized, the resulting corporation being named the Oklahoma Natural Gas Corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware; that the reorganized corporation took over all the contracts, franchises, property, and assets of the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, and assumed all the debts, liabilities, and obligations of that company, including the liability and obligation to make the refund to the patrons of the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company involved in this action, if it should finally be held that the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company itself had been obligated to make such refunds; that the Oklahoma Natural Gas Corporation assumed the performance of the public service theretofore performed by the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company; that the new corporation became and is the successor in law and in fact of the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company; that the latter company was by decree of the district court of Tulsa county, Oklahoma, duly and legally dissolved as a corporation; and that, even if the decree had not been rendered, it would have been dissolved by expiration of the time limit in its charter in October, 1926. It is said that the reorganized corporation, both by its assumption \n\n[273 U.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n thereof and by law, is liable for the refunds or discounts involved herein, if the order requiring them is valid, and that the state of Oklahoma looks to and will look to the reorganized corporation for the payment of the same if the order is finally affirmed. The counsel for the old company, the Attorney General of Oklahoma and the counsel for the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, all sign the motion.\n There is no specific provision in our rules for the substitution as a party litigant of a successor to a dissolved corporation. It is well settled that at common law and in the federal jurisdiction a corporation which has been dissolved is as if it did not exist, and the result of the dissolution cannot be distinguished from the death of natural person in its effect. Mumma v. Potomac Co., 8 Pet. 281; National Bank v. Colby, 21 Wall. 609; Pendleton v. Russell, \n144 \nU.S. 640\n, 12 S. Ct. 743; Bank of United States v. McLaughlin, Fed. Cas. No. 928; Greeley v. Smith, Fed. Cas. No. 5,748; Walters v. Western & Altlantic Railroad Co. (C. C.) 69 F. 679; Marion Phosphate Co. v. Perry (C. C. (A.) 74 F. 425, 33 L. R. A. 252; Board of Councilmen of the City of Frankfort v. Deposit Bank of Frankfort (C. C.) 120 F. 165; United States v. Spokane Mill Co. (D. C.) 206 F. 999. See, also, Edison Co. v. Westinghouse ( C. C.) 34 F. 232, and Edison Co. v. United States Lighting Co. (C. C. A.) 52 F. 300. It follows, therefore, that as the death of the natural person abates all pending litigation to which such a person is a party, dissolution of a corporation at common law abates all litigation in which the corporation is appearing either as plaintiff or defendant. To allow actions to continue would be to continue the existence of the corporation pro hac vice. But corporations exist for specific purposes, and only by legislative act, so that if the life of the corporation is to continue even only for litigating purposes it is necessary that there should be some statutory authority for the prolongation. The matter is \n\n[273 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n really not procedural or controlled by the rules of the court in which the litigation pends. It concerns the fundamental law of the corporation enacted by the state which brought the corporation into being.\n This corporation is said to have been created before Oklahoma became a state by the law of Indian Territory, so we may presume that the corporation law of the state of Oklahoma since enacted (Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921, c. 34, article 5,  5361) has full application. Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561, 571\n, 572 S., 32 S. Ct. 704. It provides:\n'Unless other persons are appointed by the court, the directors or managers of the affairs of such corporation at the time of its dissolution are trustees of the creditors and stockholders or members of the corporation dissolved, and have full power to settle the affairs of the corporation, and to collect and pay debts and divide among the stockholders the property which remains after the payment of debts and necessary expenses; and for such purposes may maintain or defend actions in their own names by the style of the trustees of such corporation dissolved, naming it; and no action whereto any such corporation is a party shall abate by reason of such dissolution.'\n\n We have found no Oklahoma case that construes this provision with reference to the question now before the court. The language of the section would seem to indicate that as there is to be no abatement the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company for litigating purposes is still in being and continues to be a party before this court.\n The showing made for the motion is that the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company was by a decree of the district court of Tulsa county, Oklahoma, duly and legally dissolved as a corporation. There is nothing to indicate why the company was dissolved. We may assume, but we do not know, that it was in anticipation of its dissolution of force of law and that the proceeding was undertaken in order to transfer its assets, its obligations, and its liabilities to another corporation, which is averred to be a corpora- \n\n[273 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n tion of another state, to wit, of Delaware, although the seal which is attached to the consent of the Oklahoma Natural Gas Corporation by its president and secretary and accompanies the motion, shows that it was incorporated, not in Delaware, but in Maryland.\n The motion is signed by counsel for the appellant, the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company. He does not explain how he continues to represent the appellant, if in fact it has ceased to be as he represents to this court.\n In the absence of a fuller showing as to just what the proceeding was in the district court of Tulsa county in respect to the dissolution of the old company and in view of the provisions of the Oklahoma statute, we think it unwise to grant the motion for substitution, even though with the consent of the appellees. It may be that with the disclosure of all the facts and circumstances we may find that what was done with the consent of all the parties to this suit is in fact a novation which we can make effective. United States v. City Bank, 19 How. 384; Ex parte Railroad, \n95 U.S. 221\n, 222.\n We are not advised as to whether at the time of the dissolution of the corporation by time, liquidating trustees of the old company were appointed under the statute. If they were, then they should appear in this proceeding. The motion to substitute is denied without prejudice to a renewal of it on a fuller showing. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOVERLAND MOTOR CO. v.

Section 239 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act Jan. 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 938 (Comp. St.  1216). The suit is one in which the Packard Motor Car Company and the Wire Wheel Corporation seek to enjoin an alleged infringement by the Overland Motor Company of the Cowles patent, No. 1,103,567, issued to Cowles on July 14, 1914, and owned by them. On August 25, 1899, Cowles filed an application which was duly granted July 13, 1900. His application disclosed the matter in suit. The Patent Office, however, required a division of claims, and he canceled all claims, \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 419]\n\u00a0\n as well as the description and drawing in the specification that supported such claims bearing upon the subject matter of the present controversy. In that case the patent as granted covered merely the remaining claims. September 6, 1901, he filed another application, not a divisional application, disclosing and claiming, among other things, the subject- matter in suit. This was pending in the Patent Office until January 21, 1913, when a patent issued for it. Certain claims made by him were repeatedly rejected by the Patent Office. Cowles complied with the requirements of section 4894, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9438), requiring an applicant to reply to the action of the Patent Office within a year, but on seven different occasions he delayed more than 11 months before filing his response to the Patent Office ruling. On May 20, 1911, the Patent Office finally rejected the only claim remaining in the application which was directed to the subject-matter in issue, holding that it was unpatentable on certain references. On May 17, 1912, Cowles canceled this finally rejected claim from his application, stating his intention to file a divisional application covering the subject-matter of this claim. No such divisional application had ever been directed or suggested by the Patent Office. A patent was then (January 21, 1913) issued on other claims, without any claim to the subject-matter in issue. On August 6, 1912, Cowles filed an application for a patent which he stated was a division of the application filed September 6, 1901, and which disclosed and sought the claims in issue. The patent in suit was then issued on this application on July 14, 1914. During its pendency in the Patent Office, Cowles complied with the requirements of section 4894, Revised Statutes, although on one occasion he delayed over 11 months before responding to the Patent Office action. During the period from 1905 to 1912 trade journals of the United States and Great Britain published articles disclosing the subject-matter in issue, and certain \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 420]\n\u00a0\n British patents were granted, on subjects relating to such subject-matter. The publications and patents represented independent work in Great Britain, and, as a result thereof, there was actual use of the subject-matter in suits abroad during the pendency of the original and divisional applications above referred to. No product embodying the subject-matter of the claims in suit appeared upon the market in the United States prior to the issuing of the patent in suit. Upon these facts, the first question certified is as follows:\n Did the applicant, in canceling the claim which was finally rejected on May 20, 1911, abandon such claim or estop himself from thereafter seeking it through a new application?\n We do not find in the statement of facts any circumstances which can be held to be an abandonment by Cowles of his claim for which he subsequently secured this patent. On May 20, 1911, the claim was rejected on account of its nonpatentability in view of certain references. On May 17, 1912, he canceled the claim, stating at the time that it was his intention to file a divisional application covering this subject-matter. After he had done this, on August 6th, less than 4 months after the cancellation, he filed the claim as a divisional application under the earlier case, and this new application, with the renewed claim, went to patent on July 14, 1914. We cannot see why he was estopped by his failure to appeal from the final rejection. It is quite true that after such rejection the Commissioner of Patents might have refused to consider his divisional application as he made it without suggestion or consent by the Patent Office. In a qualified and limited sense a claim rejected as this was constitutes res judicata in favor of the Government and against the applicant. This is fully explained by Judge Morris in Re Barratt's Appeal, 14 App. D. C. 255, in speaking of a case presenting a similar question:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 417, 421]\n\u00a0\n 'While the rules that govern the finality and conclusiveness of adjudications at the common law do not apply, in the strict sense, to administrative or quasi judicial action in the Executive Department of government, yet in administrative action, as well as in judicial proceeding, it is both expendient and necessary that there should be an end of controversy. Sometimes, the element of finality in inherent in the nature of the action taken, as, for example, when letters patent have been granted, they may not be recalled, and the rights of the parties holding them again investigated. Where rights have become vested as the result of legitimate executive action, such action is necessarily final, and it is not competent thereafter for executive action to divest them, either by way of a review of the proceedings or by any new proceedings instituted with that view. Especially is this principle applicable to the proceedings of the Patent Office, which are so nearly akin to judicial proceedings as to be most appropriately designated as quasi judicial.'\n Following, then, the analogy, he finds that such a case as this may constitute res judicata in a sense, but he qualifies the statement in this important way:\n'In what we have said we do not desire it to be understood that the Patent Office may not, if it thinks proper to do so, entertain and adjudicate a second application for a patent after the first application has been rejected. What we decide is, that it is not incumbent upon the office as a duty to entertain such applications, and that, if it refuses to entertain them, it has a perfect legal right so to do. An applicant its not legally aggrieved by such refusal.'\n\n This qualification is approved in the cases of In re Fay, 15 App. D. C. 517, In re Edison, 30 App. D. C. 321, 323, and in Gold v. Gold, 34 App. D. C. 229.\n As the Patent Office, by granting the patent, must be held to have waived any objection to the applications \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 422]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that the claim allowed had been rejected before by that Office, there is no reason why the appellees below should not be allowed to avail themselves of the waiver. The answer the first question in the negative.\n Second. The second question was as follows:\n In the absence of any other excuse for lapse of time between patent applications and responses thereto than that the applicant was exercising a statutory right (R. S.  4894, as amended, setting limit of one year for response), may the bill of complaint be dismissed for want of equity because of long pendency in the Patent Office?\n We think that under the decision of this Court in United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224\n, 17 S. Ct. 809, and Chapman v. Wintroath, \n252 \nU.S. 126\n, 40 S. Ct. 234, this question must also be answered in the negative.\n By section 12 of the act of 1861 (12 Stat. 246), it was required that all applications for patent should be completed and prepared for examination within 2 years after the filing of the petition, and in default thereof, were to be regarded as abandoned by the parties thereto, unless shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Patents that such delay was unavoidable. There was no provision limiting the time of the prosecution of the application in this section. By act of 1870 (16 Stat. 198), it was provided, in section 32, that all applications for patent should be completed and prepared for examination within two years after the filing of the petition, and in default thereof, or upon failure of the applicant to prosecute the same within 2 years after any action therein, of which notice shall have been given to the applicant, they should be regarded as abandoned by the parties thereto, unless shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such delay was unavoidable. This provision of the act of 1870 was carried into the Revised Statutes as section 4894, and so the statute stood until 1897 when by 29 Stat. 693, section 4894 was amended as follows:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 417, 423]\n\u00a0\n 'All applications for patents shall be completed and prepared for examination within one year after the filing of the application, and in default thereof, or upon failure of the applicant to prosecute the same within one year after any action therein, of which notice shall have been given to the applicant, they shall be regarded as abandoned by the parties thereto, unless it be shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Patents that such delay was unavoidable.'\n Counsel for the alleged infringer says that, even with the time limit for action on the part of the applicant thus reduced to one year, it becomes easily possible for an applicant, after an action by the Patent Office upon his application, to delay for the full period of a year his response to such action, and however promptly the Patent Office may again act, he can delay another full year before replying to it, and thus by waiting a year after each official action (1) keep his application pending so as to enable him to withhold, indefinitely, his invention from the public, (2) add claims to his application covering the independent intervening developments of others, and (3) postpone the time when the public may enjoy the free use of the invention-all contrary to sound public policy.\n The answer to this argument is that the matter is entirely within the control of Congress, and in order to avoid and evil suggested, Congress may reduce the time within which one who is seeking an adjustment with the Patent Office in order to obtain a patent shall act upon receipt of notice of a decision of the Patent Office in the course of the application through that office. Congress, as we have seen by the history of the statute, reduced this time from an indefinite period in 1861 to two years in 1870, and to one year in 1897, and, as provided in the last Congress, to six months. Public Act No. 690, 69th Congress, approved March 2, 1927 ( 44 Stat. 1335). \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 424]\n\u00a0\n During the pendency of the application in this case, the period allowed was one year. We do not know on what principle we could apply the equitable doctrine of abandonment be laches in a case where the measure of reasonable promptness is fixed by statute, and no other ground appears by reason of which laches could be imputed to the applicant.\n In United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224\n, 17 S. Ct. 809, the government brought a proceeding in equity to cancel a patent on the ground that it had been fraudulently secured, and part of the fraud of the patentee was that he had unreasonably delayed the obtaining of the patent by collusion with officials of the department through their nonaction and thus postponed the period during which the monopoly of the patent was to continue. The court found no evidence of any collusion or fraud by the officials of the department or undue or improper influence exerted or attempted to be exerted upon them. It said that Congress had established a department with officials selected by the government, to whom all applications for patents must be made, had prescribed the terms and conditions of such applications and entrusted the entire management of affairs of the department to those officials, that when an applicant for a patent complied with the terms and conditions prescribed and filed his application with the officers of the department, he must abide their action and could not be held to suffer or lose rights by reason of any delay on the part of those officials. The court said:\n'Neither can a party pursuing a strictly legal remedy be adjudged in the wrong if he acts within the time allowed, and pursues the method prescribed by the statute. ... Under section 4886, Revised Statutes, an inventor has 2 years from the time his invention is disclosed to the \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 425]\n\u00a0\n public within which to make his application, and unless an abandonment is shown during that time he is entitled to a patent, and the patent runs as any other patent for 17 years from its date. He cannot be deprived of this right by proof that if he had filed his application immediately after the invention the patent would have been issued 2 years earlier than it was, and the public therefore would have come into possession of the free use of the invention 2 years sooner. The statute has given this right, and no consideration of public benefit can take it from him. Hir right exists because Congress has declared that it should. ... A party seeking a right under the patent statutes may avail himself of all their provisions, and the courts may not deny him the benefit of a single one. These are questions not of natural but of purely statutory right. Congress, instead of fixing 17, had the power to fix 30 years as the life of a patent. No court can disregard any statutory provisions in respect to these matters on the ground that in its judgment they are unwise or prejudicial to the interests of the public.'\n\n The case of Chapman v. Wintroath, \n252 \nU.S. 126\n, 40 S. Ct. 234, was an attempt in an interference suit to defeat a patent granted to the Chapmans on a divisional application for an improvement in deep well pumps in which the claims were the same as the claims of a patent to Wintroath, the divisional application having been made 20 months later than the date of the issue of the patent to Wintroath. It was conceded that the claims had been disclosed in the Chapman patent which had been applied for in 1909, but which had met unusual difficulties in the Patent Office, and though regularly prosecuted, as required by law and the rules of the Office, was still pending without having been passed to patent in 1915, when the controversy arose. It was admitted that the inven- \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 426]\n\u00a0\n tion was clearly disclosed in the parent application of the Chapmans, but it was contended that their divisional application claiming the discovery should be denied, because of their delay of nearly 20 months in filing it after the publication of Wintroath's patent, when they had by law only one year. It was held by the Court of Appeals of the District (Wintroath v. Chapman, 47 App. D. C. 428) that the delay of more than a year constituted equitable laches and estopped the Chapmans from making its divisional claim. That holding had rested on a previous decision by the Court of Appeals in Rowntree v. Sloan, 45 App. D. C. 207. This court held that under section 4886 of the Revised Statutes, as amended March 3, 1897 (Comp. St.  9430), 2 years was granted in such a case before the right to file a divisional application had been lost. The court based its decision that the statutory period could not be reduced by equitable considerations or those of public policy on the language which we have just quoted from Mr. Justice Brewer in his opinion in the Telephone Case. The same doctrine is to be found in Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Aluminum Co. (C. C. A.) 108 F. 845, and Columbia Motor Car Co. v. Duerr & Co. (C. C. A.) 184 F. 893.\n The case of Woodbridge v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 50\n, 44 S. Ct. 45, is cited by counsel for the defendant to sustain their view that this is a case in which the doctrine of laches and abandonment may be enforced. The Woodbridge Case was an exceptional one. Woodbridge had deliberately delayed the issue of the patent which he could have had for the asking for 9 years. He had directed the Patent Office to keep the papers upon which such issue might have been granted in the secret archives of the Patent Office, there to remain for one year a privilege which was given him under the law as it then existed. He failed after the one year to apply for the patent for the reason, because as he avowed in subsequent application, he wished there \n\n[274 U.S. 417, 427]\n\u00a0\n by to postpone the period of its monopoly until a national emergency might arise in which his invention, which was for rifling cannon, should be more in demand than it then was. He was denied a patent for failure to comply with the statute. Subsequently he secured special legislation imposing the condition that he should be granted the patent, provided the court should first be satisfied that he had not forfeited or abandoned his right to a patent by publication, delay, laches or otherwise. This court held that the delay of 9 years for the avowed purpose of postponing the period of the monopoly was laches and a breach of the condition upon which he might avail himself of the special congressional privilege aranted him. Such a case has certainly no application here. The answer to the question should be in the negative. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAN AMERICAN PETROLEUM & TRANSPORT CO. v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 305\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1927\n\n\n United States \n273 U.S. 456\n (1927) ]\n\n\n[273 U.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank J. Hogan, of Washington, D. C., and Frederic R. Kellogg, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 456, 473]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Owen J. Roberts, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Atlee Pomerene, of Cleveland, Ohio, for the United States.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 456, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the United States in the northern division of the southern district of California against the petitioners, Pan- American Petroleum and Transport Company and Pan-American Petroleum Company. The former will be called the Transport Company and the latter the Petroleum Company. The relief sought is the cancelation of two contracts with the Transport Company, dated April 25, and December 11, 1922, and two leases of lands in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1, to the Petroleum Company, dated June 5 and December 11, 1922, an injunction, the appointment of receivers, and an accounting. The complaint alleges that the con- \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 486]\n\u00a0\n tracts and leases were obtained and consummated by means of conspiracy, fraud and bribery, and that they were made without authority of law. Receivers were appointed to take possession of and operate the properties pending the suit. At the trial the court heard much evidence and later made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, announced an opinion ( 6 F.(2d) 43), and entered its decree. It adjudged the contracts and leases void and ordered them canceled; it directed the Petroleum Company to surrender the lands and equipment, and stated an account between the United States and each of the companies. The Transport Company was charged the value of petroleum products received by it and the amount of profits derived upon their sale, and was given credit for the actual cost of construction work performed and of fuel oil delivered under the contracts. The Petroleum Company was charged the value of the petroleum products taken under the leases and given credit for actual expenditures in drilling and operating wells and making other useful improvements. Interest was added to each of the items. The companies appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the United States took a cross-appeal. That court affirmed the decree, so far as it awards affirmative relief to the United States, and reversed that part which gives credit to the companies. 9 F.(2d) 761.\n Under R. S.  2319, 2329 (Comp. St.  4614, 4628), and the Act of February 11, 1897, c. 216, 29 Stat. 526 (Comp. St.  4635), public lands containing oil were open to settlement, exploration and purchase. Exploration and location were permitted without charge, and title could be obtained for a nominal amount. United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 466\n, 35 S. Ct. 309. Prior to the autumn of 1909 large areas of public land in California were explored; petroleum was found, patents were obtained, and large quantities of oil were taken. In September of that year, the Director of the Geological Survey \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 487]\n\u00a0\n reported that, at the rate oil lands in California were being patented, all would be taken within a few months, and that, in view of the increased use of fuel oil by the Navy, there appeared to be immediate need for conservation. Then the President, without specific authorization of Congress, by proclamation withdrew from disposition in any manner specified areas of public lands in California and Wyoming amounting to 3, 041,000 acres. By the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847 (Comp. St .  4523-4525), Congress expressly authorized the President to withdraw public lands containing oil, gas and other minerals. An executive order of July 2, 1910, confirmed the withdrawals then in force. By a later order, September 2, 1912, the President directed that some of these lands 'constitute Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 and shall be held for the exclusive use or benefit of the United States Navy until this order is revoked by the President or by act of Congress.' This reserve includes all the lands involved in this suit. By a similar order, December 13, 1912, the President created the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 2.\n The Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437 (Comp. St.  4640 1\/4 et seq.), regulates the exploration and mining of public lands, and authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant permits for exploration and make leases covering oil and gas lands, exclusive of those withdrawn or reserved for military or naval purposes. The Act of June 4, 1920, c. 228, 41 Stat. 812, 813, appropriated $30,000 to be used, among other things, for investigating fuel for the Navy and the availability of the supply allowed by naval reserves in the public domain. It contains the following:\n'Provided, that the Secretary of the Navy is directed to take possession of all properties within the naval petroleum reserves ... to conserve, develop, use, and operate the same in his discretion, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange, or sell the oil and gas products thereof, and those from all roy- \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 488]\n\u00a0\n alty oil from lands in the naval reserves, for the benefit of the United States: ... And provided further, that such sums as have been or may be turned into the Treasury of the United States from royalties on lands within the naval petroleum reserves prior to July 1, 1921, not to exceed $500,000, are hereby made available for this purpose until July 1, 1922: Provided further, that this appropriation shall be reimbursed from the proper appropriations on account of the oil and gas products from said properties used by the United States at such rate, not in excess of the market value of the oil, as the Secretary of the Navy may direct.' Comp. St.  2804i.\n\n March 5, 1921, Edwin Denby became Secretary of the Navy and Albert B. Fall Secretary of the Interior. May 31, 1921, the President promulgated an executive order purporting to commit the administration and conservation of all oil and gas bearing lands in the reserves to the Secretary of the Interior, subject to the supervision of the President.\n The contract, dated April 25, 1922, was executed on behalf of the United States by the Acting Secretary of the Interior and by the Secretary of the Navy. The Transport Company agreed to furnish at the naval station at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, 1,500,000 barrels of fuel oil and deliver it into storage facilities there to be constructed by the company according to specifications of the Navy. The company was to receive its compensation in crude oil to be taken from the reserves. The quantity, on the basis of the posted field prices of crude oil prevailing during the life of the contract, was to be the equivalent of the market value of the fuel oil and also sufficient to cover the cost of the storage facilities. The United States agreed to deliver to the company at the place of production month by month all the royalty oil furnished by lessees in Reserves Nos. 1 and 2 until all claims under the contract were satisfied. It was stipulated that if production of crude oil \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 489]\n\u00a0\n should decrease so as unduly to prolong performance, 'then the government will, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, grant additional leases on such lands as he may designate in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 as shall be sufficient to maintain total deliveries of royalty oil under this contract at the approximate rate of five hundred thousand barrels ( 500,000) per annum.' And, by article XI of the contract, it was agreed that, if during the life of the contract such additional leases should be granted within specified areas, 'the contractor shall first be called upon by the Secretary of the Interior to meet such drilling conditions and to pay such royalties as the Secretary may deem just and proper, and in the event of his acceptance ... the contractor shall be granted by the government a preferential lease on such tracts as the Secretary of the Interior may decide to lease. In the event of the failure of the contractor to agree ... then said lease or leases may be offered for competitive bidding, but the contractor shall have a right to submit a bid on equal terms with others engaged in said bidding.'\n The lease of June 5, 1922, was signed by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior. It was made in accordance with a letter of April 25, 1922, signed by the Acting Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Navy, and sent to J. J. Cotter, who was vice president of the Transport Company. It covered the quarter section described in the letter. This lease was assigned to the Petroleum Company.\n The contract dated December 11, 1922, is signed for the United States by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Navy. It declares that it is desired to fill storage tanks at Pearl Harbor promptly as they are completed and also to procure additional fuel oil and other petroleum products in storage there and elsewhere; that the Secretary of the Navy requested the Secretary of the \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 490]\n\u00a0\n Interior as administrator of the naval petroleum reserves to arrange for such products in storage and to exchange therefor additional royalty crude oil, 'the probably cost of the additional products and storage immediately planned for being estimated at $15,000,000 more or less'; that this cannot be done on the basis of exchange for the crude oil coming to the government under the present leases; that, under the contract of April 25, 1922, the company is granted preferential right to leases to certain lands in Naval Reserve No. 1; and that the company was planning to provide refinery facilities at Los Angeles, together with pipe lines from the field to the refinery and docks, and to erect storage having capacity of 2, 000,000 barrels or more. The company agreed to furnish, as directed by the Secretary of the Interior, the fuel oil in storage at Pearl Harbor covered by the earlier contract; to construct for actual cost additional storage facilities there, as required, up to 2,700,000 barrels; to furnish without charge, other petroleum products in the proposed storage as and when completed on the basis of market prices plus transportation cost at going rates; to furnish without charge, until expiration of the contract, storage for 1,000,000 barrels of fuel oil at Los Angeles; to fill it with fuel oil for the Navy at such time as government royalty oil should be available for exchange, and to bunker government ships from such oil at cost; to maintain for 15 years subject to the demands of the Navy 3,000, 000 barrels of fuel oil in the company's depots at Atlantic Coast points; to furnish crude oil products and storage facilities at other points, designated by the government, when sufficient crude oil has been delivered to satisfy the Pearl Harbor contract; to sell the Navy at 10 per cent. less than market price additional available fuel oil produced from the reserves and manufactured products from its California refineries; to credit the Navy for crude oil at published prices and for gas and casinghead gasoline at prices fixed \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 491]\n\u00a0\n in the leases, and to satisfy any surplus credits of the government by delivery of fuel oil or other petroleum products, by construction of additional storage facilities, or by payment in cash as the government might elect. The United States agreed to deliver to the company in exchange all royalty oil, gas and casing head gasoline produced on Reserves Nos. 1 and 2 until its obligations were discharged and in any event for 15 years after the expiration of the contract of April 25, 1922 ( which was without specified time limit), and to lease to the company all the unleased lands in Reserve No. 1.\n The lease of December 11, 1922, is signed for the United States by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Navy. It covers all unleased lands in Reserve No. 1, but with a provision that no drilling shall be done on approximately the western half without the lessor's consent. It runs for 20 years and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities. The royalties range from 12 1\/2 to 35 per cent.\n A joint resolution adopted by the Senate and House of Representatives and approved by the President February 8, 1924 (43 Stat. 5), stated that it appeared from evidence taken by the committee on public lands and survey of the Senate that the contract of April 25, 1922, and the lease of December 11, 1922, were executed under circumstances indicating fraud and corruption, without authority on the part of the officers purporting to act for the United States and in defiance of the settled policy of the government to maintain in the ground a great reserve supply of oil adequate to the needs of the Navy. It declared the contracts and leases to be against public interest and that the lands should be recovered and held for the purposes to which they were dedicated. And it authorized and directed the President to cause suit to be prosecuted for the annulment and cancellation of the lease and all contracts incidental and supplementary thereto, \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 492]\n\u00a0\n and to prosecute such other action or proceedings, civil and criminal, as might be warranted.\n The findings contain what in abridged substance follows:\n E. L. Doheny controlled both companies Fall as active in procuring the transfer of the administration of naval petroleum reserves from the Navy Department to the Interior. And, after the executive order was made, he dominated the negotiations that eventuated in the contracts and leases. From the inception no matter of policy or action of importance was determined without his consent. Denby was passive throughout, and signed the contracts and lease and the letter of April 25, 1922, under misapprehension and without full knowledge of their contents. July 8, 1921, Fall wrote Doheny:\n'There will be no possibiliy of any further conflict with Navy officials and this department, as I have notified Secretary Denby that I should conduct the matter of naval leases under the direction of the President, without calling any of his force in consultation unless I conferred with himself personally upon a matter of policy He understands the situation and that I shall handle matters exactly as I think best and will not consult with any officials of any bureau in his department, but only with himself, and such consultation will be confined strictly and entirely to matters of general policy.'\n\n After that Doheny and his companies acted upon the belief that Fall had authority to make the contracts and leases. Doheny and Fall conferred as to a proposal to be made by the Transport Company whereby it should receive from the United States royalty oil for constructing storage facilities at Pearl Harbor and filling them with fuel oil. They discussed the matter of granting other leases in Reserve No. 1. They also discussed a petition of the Petroleum Company for reduction of royalties under an existing lease Fall and Admiral John K. Robison, per- \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 493]\n\u00a0\n sonal representative of the Secretary of the Navy in naval reserve matters, agreed that the porposed contract should be kept secret so that Congress and the public should not know what was being done. (But it is to be said that Robison's motives in this were not the same as Fall's.)\n November 28, 1921, Doheny submitted to Fall a proposal stating that, in accordance with a suggestion from Fall, he had made inquiries as to cost of constructing storage for 1,500,000 barrels of fuel oil at Pearl Harbor. He gave in detail figures relating to such cost, the price of crude oil in the field and of fuel oil at Pearl Harbor, and stated the total amount of crude oil necessary to pay for the tanks and fuel oil 'on the basis of our being paid for both tanks and oil in royalty crude oil produced from lands within the naval reserves and to be leased to us.' The letter concluded:\n'I suppose you will turn this matter over to First Assistant Secretary Finney, who, with Rear Admiral Robison, may arrange the details of it during your absence, and as I also expect to be absent, I am confidentially furnishing Mr. Cotter with the information so that he can intelligently discuss the matter with Mr. Finney.'\n\n And the next day Fall wrote Robison:\n'Mr. Cotter will wait upon you with data, etc., with relation to oil tanks and royalty oils in connection with Pearl Harbor demands. I have asked him also to hand you, for your inspection, the original of a letter from Colonel Doheny addressed to myself, containing a re sume of the data. Should you think best to accept this proposition then of course it would be necessary, in my judgment, to turn over to Col. Doheny, if we can do so, leases upon further wells or area in the naval reserve in which he is now drilling. If this is done it must be understood that the royalty must be made less than are the present royalties being paid by the Midway and Pan-American.'\n\n The letter stated that the gas pressure was lessening and that the companies were suffering loss in the payment of the \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 494]\n\u00a0\n 55 per cent. royalty:\n'If you approve the proposition, will you kindly indicate to me such approval by simple endorsement upon Col. Doheny's letter to myself, signed by yourself. Your simple O. K. will be sufficient.'\n\n Doheny had agreed to advance $100,000 to Fall as and when he should need it. November 30, at Fall's request, Doheny sent him $100,000 in currency. The money was obtained in New York on the check of Doheny's son who carried it to Washington and gave it to Fall, and Fall sent to Doheny by the son a demand note for $100,000. No entry of the advance was made in the accounts of Doheny or the petitioners. Nothing has been paid on account of principal or interest. At that time it was understood between Doheny and Fall that the klatter need not repay it in kind. Doheny intended, if Fall did not dispose of a certain ranch in New Mexico, to cause the Transport Company to employ him at a salary sufficient to enable him, out of one-half of it, to pay off the amount in five of six years; and he knew that Fall expected to leave the service of the government and accept employment with one of his companies. A few weeks after it was given, Doheny tore Fall's signature off the note so that it would not be enforceable in the hands of others. December 1, Fall gave instructions to subordinates that the petition of the petroleum Company for reduction of royalties should not be granted but that, as relief, the company be given another lease at regulation royalties.\n Long in advance of receipt of bids Fall knew that the Transport Company would offer to construct storage facilities at cost and to fill them with fuel oil in exchange for royalty oil and for the assurance that other leases on lands in Reserve No. 1 would be granted to it. Others were not advised that the united States would consider a bid conditioned on assurance to the bidder of other leases or preferential right to leases. Due to the interest of Fall, the Transport Company had opportunities for conference with \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 495]\n\u00a0\n and advice from those acting for the United States which were not given to others. There were five other oil companies with which officers or employees of the United States conferred as to the proposed contract. Fall knew that two of these would not bid because they considered the proposed contract illegal; that two of the others had not been invited to bid, and that the other one would refuse to bid unless authority for the contract should be obtained from Congress. Invitation for proposals was sent two construction companies; but Fall understood and stated that it was impossible for either of them to bid because payment had to be made in royalty oil. April 13, Fall left Washington for Three Rivers, N. M. Before leaving he gave instructions that no bids should be accepted or contract awarded without his consent. The bids were opened April 15. Four were received; one was conditioned upon congressional approval of the contract; one did not cover the construction work and applied only to furnishing the fuel oil; the other two proposals were from the Transport Company; one of them, designated A, was in accordance with the invitation for bids, but the other, called B, was not. The latter named the smaller lump sum in barrels of crude oil; it stated that if actual cost was less than a specified amount the saving should be credited to the government; and it was conditioned upon granting the bidder preferential right to become lessee in all leases that thereafter might be granted by the United States for recovery of oil and gas in Reserve No. 1. On April 18 Edward C. Finney, Acting Secretary of the Interior, telegraphed Fall that certain officials and employees of the United States recommended acceptance of proposal B; on the same day Fall consented by telegram, and Finney sent a letter to the company purporting to award the contract to it. Cotter then stated that the Transport Company did not desire to make the contract unless the United States would agree, within 12 \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 496]\n\u00a0\n months, to grant the company a lease or leases of lands in Reserve No. 1. He also raised the question whether the executive order of May 31, 1921, had any legal force and refused to permit the company to make the contract unless Denby should sign as Secretary of the Navy. April 20, Arthur W. Ambrose of the Bureau of Mines as sent from Washington to Three Rivers with the papers in the case. He was instructed to consult Fall as to whether Denby should be made a party to the contract. April 23, Fall by telegram agreed that Denby should be made a party and directed Finney to execute the contract for the Department of the Interior. While it is not clearly shown that Ambrose took with his a draft of the letter of April 25, signed by Denby and Finney and sent to Cotter, he was instructed to, and did, consuit Fall concerning it. That letter declares that the company's proposals were the lowest received by the government. After stating that, expressed in money, proposal B is the better by $235,184.40, and by the possible saving by performance for less than the estimated cost of construction, it said:\n'It is evident from our conversation of April 18 that your interpretation of preferential right was to the effect that the ... Transport Company desired the right to lease certain specified land in naval petroleum reserve No. 1 as well as preferential right to lease other land in naval petroleum reserve No. 1 to the extent described in article XI of contract. It is also my understanding from your conversation that unless the ... Transport Company could get a lease to certain lands, your company would not desire to enter into a contract under the terms outlined in proposal (B) and preferred the government would accept proposal (A).'\n\n The letter then stated that the department favored proposal B and reiterated its stated advantages over the other proposal. Then it said:\n'In order that the government may take advantage of a contract embodying the terms outlined in proposal (B), I wish to advise you that \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 497]\n\u00a0\n the Department of the Interior will agree to grant to the ... Transport Company within one year from the date of the delivery of a contract relative to the Pearl Harbor project leases to drill the following tracts of land.'\n\n The letter specified the quarter section covered by the lease of June 5, 1922, and an additional strip, and stated that the royalties to be required would not be greater than specified rates ranging from 12 1\/2 to 35 per cent. The preferential right was inserted to prevent competition. The assurance that additional leases would be given was not necessary or required under proposal B.\n After the making of the contract of April 25, the posted field price of crude oil declined rapidly. In the autumn of 1922 the Transport Company and Doheny were in correspondence or consultation with Fall for the purpose of at once securing additional leases in Reserve No. 1. Doheny submitted a proposition to Fall which the latter delivered to his subordinates with his favorable recommendation. Later Doheny enlarged the proposition, and there followed negotiations concerning the proposed lease. Doheny and Fall agreed upon a schedule of royalties. The lease of December 11 was arranged without competition of any kind. Plans for the proposed construction work had not been prepared. Before the contract and lease were made Fall and others in his department stated to persons making inquiries that it was not the intention to make leases or to drill in that reserve. The danger of drainage had been eliminated by agreement between the United States and oil companies operating in the vicinity that no drilling should be done by either except on six months' notice to the other.\n The District Court concluded that the contracts and leases were obtained by corruption and fraud. On their appeal, petitioners challenged practically all the findings of the trial court. The Circuit Court of Appeals, after \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 498]\n\u00a0\n stating the issue and the substance of the facts found and conclusions reached below, said:\n'We find no ground for disturbing the findings of fact which we deem essential to the decision of he case, and, while the evidence may be insufficient to support certain contested findings, the disputed facts, in view of our conclusions upon the law applicable to the case, become of little importance.'\n\n The petitioners here argue that the Secretary of the Navy did in fact exert the authority conferred by the Act of June 4, 1920, and that Fall did not dominate the making of the contracts and leases; that it was not proved by any evidence competent or admissible against the companies that Doheny gave Fall $100,000; that the giving of the money did not affect the transaction; that it was a loan and not a bribe, and that the record does not sustain the conclusion of the District Court.\n We have considered the evidence, and we are satisfied that the findings as to the matters of fact here controverted are fully sustained, except the statement that Denby signed the contracts and leases under misapprehension prehension and without full knowledge of the contents of the documents. As to that the record requires an opposite finding. Under the Act of June 4, 1920, it was his official duty to administer the oil reserves; he was not called as a witness, and it is not to be assumed that he was without knowledge of the disposition to be made of them or of the means employed to get storage facilities and fuel oil for the Navy. He is presumed to have had knowledge of what he signed; there are direct evidence and proven circumstances to show that he had. But the evidence sustains the finding that he took no active part in the negotiations, and that Fall, acting collusively with Doheny, dominated the making of the contracts and leases.\n The finding that Doheny caused the $100,000 to be given to Fall is adequately sustained by the evidence. \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 499]\n\u00a0\n Early in 1924, during the investigation of these contracts and leases by the Senate committee, Doheny voluntarily appeared as witness and there gave testimony for the purpose of explaining the money transaction between him and Fall at the time the initial contract was being negotiated. At the trial of this case, over objections of the companies, his statements before the committee were received in evidence. Petitioners insist that they were not admissible. But Doheny acted for both companies when the contracts and leases were negotiated. He controlled the voting power of one that owned all the shares of the other. He was President of the Petroleum Company up to July 24, 1922, and then became chairman of its board. He was President of the Transport Company until December 7, 1923, when he became chairman of its board. He was chairman of both when he testified. There is no evidence that his control over or authority to act for these companies was less in 1924, when he appeared for them before the committee, than it was in 1921 and 1922, when he negotiated and executed the contracts and leases. The companies were much concerned as to the investigation lest it might result in an effort to set aside the transaction. , the hearing before the committee was an occasion where it was proper for them to be represented. Doheny had acted for them from the inception of the venture. The facts and circumstances disclosed by the record justified the lower courts in holding that, when he testified before the committee, he was acting for the companies within the scope of his authority. His statements on that occasion are properly to be taken as theirs, and are admissible in evidence against them. Chicago v. Greer, 9 Wall. 726, 732; Xenia Bank v. Stewart, \n114 \nU.S. 224, 229\n, 5 S. Ct. 845; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Courtney, \n186 \nU.S. 342, 349\n, 351 S., 22 S. Ct. 833; AEtna Indemnity Co. v. Auto- Traction Co. (C. C. A.) 147 F. 95, 98; Joslyn v. Cadillac Co. (C. C. A.) \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 500]\n\u00a0\n 177 F. 863, 865; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Coleman, 18 Ill. 297, 298, 68 Am. Dec. 544.\n The facts and circumstances disclosed by the record show clearly that the interest and influence of Fall as well as his official action were corruptly secured by Doheny for the making of the contracts and leases; that, after the executive order of May 31, 1921, Fall dominated the administration of the naval reserves, and that the consummation of the transaction was brought about by means of collusion and corrupt conspiracy between him and Doheny. Their purpose was to get for petitioners oil and gas leases covering all the unleased lands in the reserve. The making of the contracs was a means to that end. The whole transaction was tainted with corruption. It was not necessary to show that the money transaction between Doheny and Fall constituted bribery as defined in the Criminal Code or that Fall was financially interested in the transaction or that the United States suffered or was liable to suffer any financial loss or disadvantage as a result of the contracts and leases. It is enough that these companies sought and corruptly obtained Fall's dominating influence in furtherance of the venture. It is clear that, at the instance of Doheny, Fall so favored the making of these contracts and leases that it was impossible for him loyally or faithfully to serve the interests of the United States. The lower courts for that reason rightly held the United States entitled to have them adjudged illegal and void. Crocker v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 74, 80\n, 81 S., 36 S. Ct. 245; Garman v. United States, 34 Ct. Cl. 237, 242; Herman v. City of Oconto, 100 Wis. 391, 399, 76 N. W. 364; Harrington v. Victoria Graving Dock Co., L. R. 3 Q. B. D. 549; Tool Co. v.

A.) 119 F. 279, 286.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 456, 501]\n\u00a0\n The transaction evidenced by the contracts and leases was not authorized by the Act of June 4, 1920. The grant of authority to the Secretary of the Navy did not indicate a change of policy as to conservation of the reserves. The Act of June 25, 1910, the Act of February 25, 1920, the executive orders, and the Joint Resolution of February 8, 1924, show that it has been and is the policy of the United States to maintain a great naval petroleum reserve in the ground. While the possibility of loss by drainage might be a reason for legislation enabling the Secretary to take any appropriate action that at any time might become necessary to save the petroleum, it is certain that the contracts and leases have no such purpose. The work to be paid for in crude products contemplated the construction of fuel depots. The one covered by the first contract was a complete unit sufficient for 1,500,000 barrels including pumping stations, fire protection and its own wharf and channel. It is not necessary to consider the possible extent of the construction that might be required under the later contract. Indeed it could not then be known how much work and products in storage it would take to exhaust the reserve. The record shows that the Navy Department estimated the cost of proposed storage plants and contents at approximately $103,000,000. Congress has not authorized any such program. The department tried and failed to secure additional appropriations for the Pearl Harbor storage facilities. The Act of August 31, 1842, 5 Stat. 577 (R. S.  1552), gave the Secretary authority to construct fuel depots. But it was taken away be the Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 898. Since that time Congress has made separate appropriations for fuel stations at places specifically named. \n1\n And it has \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 502]\n\u00a0\n long been its policy to prohibit the making of contracts of purchase or for construction work in the absence of express authority and adequate appropriations therefor. R. S.  3732, 3733 (Comp. St.  6884, 6886); Act of June 12, 1906, 34 Stat. 255; Act of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 764 ( Comp. St.  6763). The Secretary was not authorized to use money received from the sale of gas products. All such sums are required to be paid into the Treasury. R. S.  3617 and 3618, as amended, 19 Stat. 249 (Comp. St .  6606, 6609).\n The words granting authority to the Secretary are 'use, store, exchange, or sell' the oil and gas products. As the Secretary, among other things, was authorized until July 1, 1922, to use money out of the appropriation to 'store' oil and gas products from these lands, it will not be held, in the absence of language clearly requiring it, that he was also empowered without limit to use crude oil to pay for additional storage facilities. Unless given him by 'exchange' the Secretary had no power by such contracts to locate or construct fuel depots. It is not contended that the clause confers unlimited authority, and the petitioners say that the word 'exchange' must have some reasonable limitation. But they insist that it is broad enough to authorize the contracts. If it is, there is no reason why crude oil may not be used to pay for any kind of construction work or to purchase any property that may be desired by the department for the use of the Navy.\n The purpose and scope of the provision are limited to the administration of the reserves. The clause is found in a proviso to an appropriation for an investigation of fuel adapted to naval requirements and the availability of the supply in the naval reserves. If 'exchange' has \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 503]\n\u00a0\n the meaning contended for by petitioners, it must be taken to indicate that Congress intended by the clause in question not only to restore to the Secretary authority in respect of fuel depots that had been taken from him by the Act of March 4, 1913, but also to enable him by means of contracts and leases such as these to reverse, if he saw fit, the established policy of the government as to the petroleum reserves. The circumstances of the enactment as well as the terms of the provision indicate a purpose to authorize exchange of crude petroleum from these reserves for fuel oil and other petroleum products suitable for use by the Navy. The Secretary was not authorized to refine the crude product. A draft of the act included that authority, but the word 'refine' was stricken out. This made necessary the exchange of the crude product for fuel oil and other products suitable for use. Whatever the meaning rightly to be attributed to the words employed, it is clear that they stop short of authorizing the Secretary to pay for improvements such as were covered by the contracts.\n The petitioners insist that, in any event, they are entitled to credit for the cost of construction work performed and of the fuel oil furnished at Pearl Harbor, and also for the amount they expended to drill and operate oil wells and to make other improvements on the leased lands.\n The substance of the account, as stated in the decree of the District Court, is printed in the margin. \n2\n The \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 504]\n\u00a0\n findings show that the storage facilities at Pearl Harbor covered by the contracts were economically completed on the lands of the United States under the direction of the companies and the supervision of officers of the Navy; that they are of benefit to the United States and are now available for use and should be retained by it; that the \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 505]\n\u00a0\n Transport Company delivered into the storage constructed a specified quantity of fuel oil of value to the United States equal to what it cost the company; that under the supervision of government officials the Petroleum Company economically expended money for development of the leased lands to produce oil, gas and gasoline and to make thereon permanent improvements that resulted in benefit to the United States equal to the amount expended.\n They maintain that, as a condition of granting the United States the relief it claims, equity requires it to give credit to them for their expenditures; that if this be denied, they will be required to pay double the value of the royalty oil they have received, and that the United States thereby will be unjustly enriched; that, except the balance shown by the account, they have paid in full for such oil; that the United States has fully paid for the benefits it received from petitioner's expenditures, and that, in effect, it now seeks to recover the payments it made voluntarily. And they insist that the United States must be made to bear these amounts even if the contracts were made without authority of law or were tainted with fraud, violation of public policy, conspiracy or other wrongful act.\n In suits brought by individuals for rescission of contracts the maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity is generally applied, so that the party against whom relief is sought shall be remitted to the position he occupied before the transaction complained of. 'The court proceeds on the principle, that as the transaction ought never to have taken place, the parties are to be placed as far as possible in the situation in which they would have stood if there had never been any such transaction.' Neblett v. Macfarland, \n92 U.S. 101\n, 103 (23 L. Ed. 471). And, while the perpetrator of the fraud has no standing to rescind, he is not regarded as an outlaw; and, if the trans- \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 506]\n\u00a0\n action is rescinded by one who has the right to do so, 'the courts will endeavor to do substantial justice so far as is consistent with adherence to law.' Stoffela v. Nugent, \n217 \nU.S. 499, 501\n, 30 S. Ct. 600, 601 (54 L. Ed. 856). The general principles of equity are applicable in a suit by the United States to secure the cancellation of a conveyance or the rescission of a contract. United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., \n200 \nU.S. 321, 339\n, 26 S. Ct. 282; United States v. Stinson, \n197 \nU.S. 200, 204\n, 25 S. Ct. 426; State of Iowa v. Carr (C. C. A.) 191 F. 257, 266; cf. Mason v. United States, \n260 U.S. 545\n, 557, et seq., 43 S. Ct. 200. But they will not be applied to frustrate the purpose of its laws or to thwart public policy.\n Causey v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 399\n, 36 S. Ct. 365, was a suit in equity brought by the United States to recover title to public lands conveyed to defendant under the homestead laws. The partent was obtained by fraud. The defendant paid the United States for the land in scrip at the rate of $1.25 per acre. The complaint did not contain an offer to return the scrip, and it was insisted by the defendant that, because of such failure, the suit could not be maintained. The court said ( p. 402 (36 S. Ct. 367)):\n'The objection assumes that the suit is upon the same plane as if brought by an individual vendor to annul a sale of land fraudulently induced. But, as this court has said, the government in disposing of its public lands does not assume the attitude of a mere seller of real estate at its market value. These lands are held in trust for all the people, and in providing for their disposal Congress has sought to advance the interests of the whole country by opening them to entry in comparatively small tracts under restrictions designed to accomplish their settlement, development and utilization. And when a suit is brought to annul a patent obtained in violation of these restrictions, the purpose is not merely to regain the title but also to enforce a public statute and maintain the policy underlying it. Such a suit is not within the reason of the \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 507]\n\u00a0\n ordinary rule that a vendor suing to annual a sale fraudulently induced must offer and be ready to return the consideration received. That rule, if applied, would tend to frustrate the policy of the public land laws; and so it is held that the wrongdoer must restore the title unlawfully obtained and abide the judgment of Congress as to whether the consideration paid shall be refunded.'\n\n Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413\n, 32 S. Ct. 424, was a suit by the United States to cancel conveyances of allotted lands made by members of the Cherokee Nation and to have the title decreed to be in the allottees and their heirs, upon the ground that the conveyances were made in violation of restrictions upon the power of alienation. On demurrer to the complaint it was insisted that the allottees had received considerations for the conveyances and should be made parties to the suit in order that equitable restoration might be enforced. The court said (p. 446 (32 S. Ct. 435)):\n'Where, however, conveyance has been made in violation of the restrictions, it is plain that the return of the consideration cannot be regarded as an essential prerequisite to a decree of cancellation. Otherwise, if the Indian grantor had squandered the money, he would lose the land which Congress intended he should hold, and the very incompetence and thriftlessness which were the occasion of the measures for his protection would render then of no avail. The effectiveness of the acts of Congress is not thus to be destroyed. The restrictions were set forth in public laws, and were matters of general knowledge. Those who dealt with the Indians contrary to these provisions are not entitled to insist that they should keep the land if the purchase price is not repaid, and thus frustrate the policy of the statute.'\n\n United States v. Trinidad Coal Co., \n137 \nU.S. 160\n, 11 S. Ct. 57, was a suit brought by the United States to set aside patents conveying certain coal lands on the ground that they were obtained by fraud and in violation of R. S.  2347, \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 508]\n\u00a0\n 2348, 2350 (Comp. St.  4659, 4660, 4662). The company, in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme to get the lands, furnished the money that was paid to the United States by the fraudulent patentees who conveyed the lands to the company. The complaint did not contain an offer by the United States to return the money. The company contended that the United States was subject to the rules that apply to individuals and that relief should be conditioned upon return of the money. The court held that the ule should not be applied in a case like that one. It laid down and applied the principles on which rest the decisions in Causey v. United States, supra, and Heckman v. United States, supra. Among other things, the court said (p. 170 (11 S. Ct. 61)):\n'If the defendant is entitled, upon a cancellation of the patents fraudulently and illegally obtained from the United States, in the name of others, for its benefit, to a return of the moneys furnished to its agents in order to procure such patents, we must assume that Congress will make an appropriation for that purpose, when it becomes necessary to do so. The proposition that the defendant, having violated a public statute in obtaining public lands that were dedicated to other purposes, cannot be required to surrender them until it has been reimbursed the amount expended by it in procuring the legal title, is not within the reason of the ordinary rule that one who seeks equity must do equity; and, if sustained, would interfere with the prompt and efficient administration of the public domain. Let the wrongdoer first restore what it confesses to have obtained from the government by means of a fraudulent scheme formed by its officers, stockholders and employe  in violation of law.'\n\n It was the purpose of those making the contracts and leases to circumvent the laws and defeat the policy of the United States established for the conservation of the naval petroleum reserves. The purpose of the representatives of the department was to get for the Navy fuel \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 509]\n\u00a0\n depots or storage facilities that had not been authorized by Congress. The leases were made to obtain the crude products for use as a substitute for money to make good the amounts advanced by petitioners to pay for such improvements. The Secretary's authority to provide facilities in which to 'store' naval reserve petroleum or its products did not extend beyond those that might be provided by use of the money made available by the Act of June 4, 1920. And, in order to get control of the oil lands covered by the leases, the companies agreed to pay for these unauthorized works of construction and to furnish fuel oil and other products of petroleum suitable for naval use to fill the storage facilities so added. The contracts and leases and all that was done under them are so interwoven that they constitute a single transaction not authorized by law and consummated by conspiracy, corruption and fraud. The United States does not stand on the same footing as an individual in a suit to annul a deed or lease obtained from him by fraud. Its position is not that of a mere seller or lessor of land. The financial element in the transaction is not the sole or principal thing involved. This suit was brought to vindicate the policy of the government, to preserve the integrity of the petroleum reserves and to devote them to the purposes for which they were created. The petitioners stand as wrongdoers, and no equity arises in their favor to prevent granting the relief sought by the Inited States. They may not insist on payment of the cost to them or the value to the government of the improvements made or fuel oil furnished as all were done without authority and as means to circumvent the law and wrongfully to obtain the leases in question. As Congress had not authorized them, it must be assumed that the United States did not want the improvements made or was not ready to bear the cost of making them. No storage of fuel oil at Pearl Harbor was authorized to be made in excess of the \n\n[273 U.S. 456, 510]\n\u00a0\n capacity of, or in any places other than the facilities provided for that purpose pursuant to authorization by Congress. Whatever their usefulness or value, it is not for the courts to decide whether any of these things are needed or should be retained or used by the United States. Such questions are for the determination of Congress. It would be unjust to require the United States to account for them until Congress acts; and petitioners must abide its judgment in respect of the compensation, if any, to be made. And this applies to the claim on account of the fuel oil as well as to the other items.

Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs were partners doing business as Phelps Bros. & Co.; the petitioner is the survivor. They owned a lease on Pier No. 7 of the Bush Terminal in New York Harbor. December 31, 1917, pursuant to an Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 (Comp. St.  1974a), and an Act of August 10, 1917,  10, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/8 ii), the Secretary of War by direction of the President requisitioned that pier and other portions of the Bush Terminal for use in carrying on the war. Plaintiffs vacated, and the United States took possession of the property and continued to occupy it until May 14th, 1919. The Secretary's order stated that steps would be taken to ascertain fair compensation for the temporary use of the property; and a board of appraisers was created for that purpose. The plaintiffs continued to pay rent to the lessor, and, in accordance with the finding of the board, the amount of such payments, $ 79,890.42, was repaid to plaintiffs by the United States. The board also found the value per month of the use of the plaintiffs' property less the monthly rents paid. The amount calculated on that basis was not satisfactory to plaintiffs; they elected to take 75 per cent. of the award and there was paid them \n\n[274 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n $44,733.79 on account. They sued to recover an amount sufficient to make up just compensation. The court found the value per day of the use of their property; the amount calculated on that basis was $254,175.79 over and above the sums paid; and that amount was included in the judgment entered March 8, 1926. Petitioner was granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 67\n, 47 S. Ct. 107, 71 L. Ed. -.\n He contends that there should be added such sums as will produce the equivalent of the value of the use of the leased property paid contemporaneously, and that interest at a reasonable rate from the date of the use to the time of payment is a good measure of the amount to be added in order to make just compensation.\n This action was brought under section 145 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1136). That section gives to the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear and determine 'all claims (except for pensions) founded upon the Constitution of the United States or ... upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States. ...' Section 177 ( Comp. St.  1168) provides that no interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for its payment. Under the Fifth Amendment plaintiffs were entitled to just compensation, and, within the meaning of section 145, the claim is one founded on the Constitution. Moreover, it has long been established that where, pursuant to an act of Congress, private property is taken for public use by officers or agents of the United States, the government is under an implied obligation to make just compensation. That implication being consistent with the constitutional duty of the government as well as with common justice, the owner's claim is one arising out of implied contract. United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645, 656\n, 5 S. Ct. 306; Duckett v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 149, 151\n, 45 S. Ct. 38; Campbell v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 368, 370\n, 45 S.

Plaintiffs' property was taken before its value was ascertained or paid. Judgment in 1926 for the value of the use of the property in 1918 and 1919, without more, is not sufficient to constitute just compensation. Section 177 does not prohibit the inclusion of the additional amount for which petitioner contends. It is not a claim for interest within the purpose or intention of that section. Acts of Congress are to be construed and applied in harmony with and not to thwart the purpose of the Constitution. The government's obligation is to put the owners in as good position pecuniarily as if the use of their property had not been taken. They are entitled to have the full equivalent of the value of such use at the time of the taking paid contemporaneously with the taking. As such payment has not been made, petitioner is entitled to the additional amount claimed. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, supra, 304 (43 S. Ct. 354); Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v.

St.  4685), as amended June 11, 1896, (29 Stat. 413, 434, c. 420 (Comp. St.  4686)), and under concurrent legislation of the state of Idaho (Comp. St. Idaho 1919, tit. 26, c. 136,  2996 et seq.). The present suit was begun in the District Court for Idaho by respondents, citizens of Massachusetts, for the foreclosure of a deed of trust, of which they are trustees. The defendants are two Idaho corporations, the Portneuf-Marsh Valley Irrigation Company and the Portneuf-Marsh Valley Canal Company, the petitioner here, referred to respectively in this opinion as the construction company and the operating company. The District Court entered a decree for the defendants on the issues now presented (299 F. 338), which was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. ( 5 F.(2d) 895). This court granted certiorari. \n270 \nU.S. 637\n, 46 S. Ct. 204.\n Proceeding under the applicable legislation, the construction company entered into a contract on June 3, 1908, with the state of Idaho for the construction of an irrigation system to supply water to certain arid lands within the state, set apart for that purpose by the federal government under the provisions of the Carey Act. The contract provided that the construction company should sell water rights in the irrigation system to such settlers as should receive from the state allotments of the designated lands and fixed maximum rates and terms of sale. A water right was defined as the right to receive sufficient water from the system to irrigate one acre of land, and represented a proportionate interest in the irrigation works. The contract contemplated vesting the control of the irrigation system in the settlers through the me- \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 633]\n\u00a0\n dium of an operating company, to be organized by the construction company as soon as the lands were thrown open to settlement. It provided that the operating company should issue one share of stock for each water right sold to settlers and that the remainder should be issued to the construction company pending further sale of water rights, and that the irrigation system when completed should be transferred to the operating company in return for its capital stock so issued. The contract stipulated also that the interest of the construction company in the irrigation system and the lands within the project might be mortgaged in accordance with the Carey Act and the statutes of Idaho, and these laws were specifically made a part of the contract.\n Pursuant to the statutes and the contract with the state, the construction company sold water rights to settlers, undertaking to deliver to them a like number of shares of stock in the operating company. The purchasers agreed that their interest in the lands to be acquired from the state, to which the water rights were to be appurtenant, and the shares of stock should be security for the deferred installment payments, and default in payment of any installment was to accelerate the maturity of the purchase price. Appropriate mortgages and assignments to be first liens upon the land were to be given for that purpose. The agreement also provided that the operating company should have power to levy all necessary tolls, charges, and assessments, which the purchasers of the water rights, represented by the stock, agreed to pay, and that the contracts for the sale of water rights might be assigned by the construction company.\n To finance the project, the construction company authorized a bond issue secured by the present mortgage of the irrigation system then being constructed. The deed provided that until default the construction company might sell water rights to entrymen and required \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 634]\n\u00a0\n that before bonds were issued, the construction company deposit with the trustees as further security the contracts for the sale of water rights, as described, and other security obtained from the purchasers.\n In compliance with the statutes and contracts, steps necessary to launch the system were taken. Water rights were sold, the designated lands were allotted to entrymen, their contracts of purchase were pledged by the construction company under its mortgage and the irrigation system was conveyed to the operating company, subject to the mortgage.\n The project did not flourish. Some of the settlers having failed to make payment of installments due on the contracts of purchase, respondents acquired their land, water rights, and stock, in some cases by foreclosure and in others by quitclaim deeds. The construction company defaulted in payment of interest on its bonds. The present suit was brought by respondents to foreclose the mortgage on the irrigation system and to foreclose any claims that the two companies might make to the land, water rights, and stock acquired by respondents in the enforcement of their rights against the entrymen under the contracts of purchase. The construction company, being insolvent, made no defense and the case was disposed of below on the theory that the trustees, as against the operating company, so far as the water rights and stock were concerned, stood in the position of the construction company. The operating company as a defense set up by answer its ownership of some of the stock in controversy acquired under a lien alleged to be superior to that of respondents. This contention was based upon the following facts:\n The certificate of incorporation of the operating company authorizes it to levy and collect tolls, charges, and assessments to defray the expense of maintenance and operation of the irrigation system, and its by- laws, con- \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 635]\n\u00a0\n cededly in accordance with the contracts and applicable statutes, require the certificates of stock to describe the lands to which the shares and water rights relate, and declare that they shall be appurtenant to such lands, unless forfeited for nonpayment of assessments. In the event of default in payment of assessments by stockholders, the operating company under local statutes may sell the stock at public auction. In the case of the stock in question the assessments had not been paid by the entrymen. The stock was sold at public auction, the operating company becoming the purchaser.\n By stipulation the decree of foreclosure was limited to the stock in the operating company, acquired by it in the manner already described, and as to that stock the decree gave priority to the maintenance liens.\n It will be observed that out of the complicated transactions by which the irrigation system was created and made appurtenant to lands set apart by the government for that purpose, two distinct classes of liens were created with respect to the stock and water rights, in addition to the general mortgage lien on the irrigation system as a whole. There were (a) the liens for maintenance and operating charges in favor of the operating company, created under its charter and bylaws by the acquisition and acceptance of its stock by the several purchasers and their failure to pay assessments; (b) the purchase-money liens in favor of the construction company on the stock and water rights and on the entrymen's land, created by the sales contracts which had been pledged to respondents.\n The charter and by-laws of the operating company provided that the construction company should not be liable for assessments for the expense of maintenance and operation while it held the stock before sale. As no charges could be levied upon the purchasers of the water rights to whom the construction company delivered the \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 636]\n\u00a0\n equivalent shares of stocks until they received allotments of land, and as the acquisition of the water rights and stock in the operating company by purchasers was conditioned upon their receiving allotments of land, it is apparent that the provisions for maintenance liens in favor of the operating company and the lien stipulations in the sales contracts became effective simultaneously on the allotment of lands to purchasers of water rights. But as the liens for maintenance came into existence only with the furnishing of water to allottees after they had acquired their land, those liens were subsequent in point of time to the purchase-money liens which attached as soon as the lands were acquired.\n Usually liens which are prior in time are prior in equity, but where as here each is stipulated for in contemplation of the creation of the other, the question of priority must be resolved by ascertaining the true meaning and effect of the stipulations themselves. And as the documents here contain no specific provision giving preference to the one class of liens or the other, the question of priority now presented must be resolved by an examination of the entire plan for establishing the irrigation system, in the light of the applicable statutes.\n Legislation permitting, a scheme for the creation of such a system might undoubtedly provide that liens for maintenance should take precedence over a general mortgage given to finance its construction. Such is the recognized order of priority in admiralty and to a more limited extent in receiverships in equity and in foreclosure proceedings. The trial court stated persuasively the contentions made here that hardship to individuals and danger to the unity and continuity of the system in event of foreclosure, if maintenance charges are not thus given the preference, are considerations which might well turn the scales in favor of that class of liens if the stat- \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 637]\n\u00a0\n utes, or the controlling documents in the absence of statutory provision, were silent or ambiguous.\n But we think the statutes here are neither silent nor ambiguous. Reading together the documents embodying the plan of organization, which specifically incorporated the provisions of the statutes, the question may be resolved without exclusive reliance upon implications to be found in the general nature and purpose of the plan itself.\n The Carey Act as amended declares:\n'A lien or liens is hereby authorized to be created by the state to which such lands are granted and by no other authority whatever, and when created shall be valid on and against the separate legal subdivisions of land reclaimed, for the actual cost and necessary expenses of reclamation and reasonable interest thereon. ...' U. S. Comp. St.  4686\n\n\n\n This statute is an enabling act, empowering the state to provide for liens by appropriate legislation. The construction of state statutes so enacted, and the status of liens created under them are local questions ( Equitable Trust Co. v. Cassia County (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 955) which, in the absence of controlling authority by the highest court of the state, we must determine for ourselves. Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S. Ct. 236. By the act of the Idaho Legislature accepting the benefits of the Carey Act (section 3019, Comp. Stat. 1919), it is provided:\n'Any person, company, or association, furnishing water for any tract of land, shall have a first and prior lien on said water right and land upon which said water is used, for all deferred payments for said water rights; said lien to be in all respects prior to any and all other liens created or attempted to be created by the owner and possessor of said land; said lien to remain in full force and effect until the last deferred payment for the water right is fully paid and satisfied according to the terms of the contract under which said water right was acquired.' \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 638]\n\u00a0\n The construction company was a company furnishing water within the meaning of the section, and the liens for the deferred payments now asserted by respondents are liens in its favor, authorized by the statute and reserved by its contracts with the purchasers. But it is argued, notwithstanding the broad language of the statute, that its application is limited by the second clause:\n\n'Said lien to be in all respects prior to any and all other liens created or attempted to be created by the owner and possessor of said land.'\n\n It is insisted, as the district court held, that by reason of this clause the liens to secure deferred payments do not take priority over the liens for maintenance because the latter are not liens created by the land owners, which alone are subordinated to the purchase contract liens.\n But we think the quoted clause cannot be thus narrowly construed. It is not in terms a limitation on the general language of the section but an amplification of it. Its apparent purpose is to make certain that entrymen, in the process of acquiring their lands and making the water rights appurtenant to them, may not by any legal device create liens which shall come ahead of the purchase contract liens given to secure the deferred payments. The clause provides that the authorized liens on the water rights and lands shall have priority over all liens created by the landowners themselves, but that is not equivalent to saying that they shall be prior to no others. It is of course an implied term of every lien statute that the lien authorized is subordinate to liens for taxes. Continental & Commercial Trust & Savings Bank v. Werner, 36 Idaho, 601, 602, 215 P. 458. If the meaning here contended for were given to the statute, liens for the unpaid purchase price would be subject to subsequent materialmen's and mechanics' liens and those of attachment and levy of execution. The statute obviously \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 639]\n\u00a0\n could not be so interpreted without thwarting its plain purpose and destroying its effective operation.\n Its primary object was to secure the requisite capital for the creation of costly irrigation systems by which arid public lands could be brought under cultivation. It could not have been contemplated that the 'first and prior' liens authorized by the statute to secure the repayment of such capital should be subsequent to every other lien which might be placed upon the property except those formally executed by the landowners or that a 'first lien' of that character would attract capital into a new and hazardous enterprise. The concluding clause of the section, 'said lien to remain in full force and effect until the last deferred payment ... is fully paid and satisfied,' can only mean that the liens for purchase money which were first when created, remain so despite maintenance liens which may later come into operation as a result of the nonpayment of assessments.\n The provisions of the various instruments for establishing the irrigation system, while not explicit, are entirely consistent with the view which we take of the meaning and effect of the statute. The contract between the two companies provided in substance, as did the by-laws of the operating company specifically (article 5,  8) that all shares of stock 'shall be held subject to the rights of' the construction company 'until the amount due such company, its successors or assigns, shall have been fully ... paid, as provided in the contract between said corporation and the purchaser of shares. ...'\n It is significant also that chapter 138 of the Compiled Statutes of Idaho, which provides for the regulation of Carey Act operating companies, contains specific provisions for establishing maintenance liens on Carey Act lands to which the water rights are appurtenant, by filing a notice of lien with the county recorder (sections 3040, 3042), a proce- \n\n[274 U.S. 630, 640]\n\u00a0\n dure which does not seem to have been followed here. There are provisions for foreclosure and sale of the land with appurtenant water rights. Sections 3045, 3046. Section 3040 describes the maintenance lien as a 'first and prior lien,' but it is expressly provided (section 3049) that this article shall not affect 'any other lien or right of lien given by the laws of this state, or otherwise,' thus in terms giving the lien authorized by section 3019 priority. Section 5631 is not applicable, since it does not pertain to water rights or stock.\n We therefore conclude that the contract liens are superior to the maintenance liens asserted by petitioner, a conclusion which makes it unnecessary for us to consider the validity of the maintenance liens challenged by respondents.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOSADOS v. CITY OF MANILA(1927)\nNo. 363\nArgued: April 28, 1927Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. O. R. McGuire, Pro hac vice, Wm. C. Rigby, and L. H. Hedrick, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Messrs. G. B. Guevara, of Pasay Rizal, Philippine Islands, and L. H. Cake, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit begun by an original petition in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands under section 2947 \n\n[274 U.S. 41, 411]\n\u00a0\n of the Compiled Acts of the Philippine Commission, 1907, Praying for an original writ of mandamus directed to Juan Posados, Jr., collector of internal revenue of the Islands and of Manila, and to Benjamin F. Wright, insular auditor, requiring the collector to issue warrants payable to the city of Manila for the share of the internal revenue taxes collected by him due to the city under the statutory law, and requiring the auditor to countersign those warrants. In furtherance of the main prayer there was a prayer for a temporary injunction against the issue and countersigning of warrants for a part of such receipts in favor of the metropolitan water district. The metropolitan water district and the insular treasurer were also made parties. The Supreme Court, after answers and hearing, granted the prayer for mandamus against the collector and auditor.\n The substance of the controversy is this: The city of Manila, under Spain, owned the waterworks furnishing water to the city for a great many years, and, since the United States became the sovereign in the Islands, the city, created a municipal corporation by the present Philippine government (chapter 60, title 10, of the Philippine Administrative Code, No. 2711), was authorized to issue bonds for $2,000,000 to enlarge and improve them. March 6, 1919, the Legislature of the Philippine Islands passed a law creating a metropolitan water district for the city and neighboring territory (Act No. 2832), made it a corporation governed by directors, and turned over the works to its management. A dispute has arisen as to whether the city of Manila should pay to the metropolitan water district compensation for water used by the city government. The authorities of the city of Manila contend that the city is not liable, because the waterworks are and have been its property for centuries. The issue was considered by the metropolitan water district board, and a majority of the board reached the conclu- \n\n[274 U.S. 41, 412]\n\u00a0\n sion that there was no money due from the city for the water paid. The Governor General has appellate administrative jurisdiction over the decisions and resolutions of the board-Act 3109-and he took the view of the minority of the board, and held that the city did owe the metropolitan district for the water furnished it. The city was not a party to this proceeding. In accord with the conclusion of the Governor General, the insular auditor directed the collector of internal revenue to withhold from the city's share of the internal revenue collections money enough to pay what was due for the water, and directed the collector to issue his warrant for that amount from the share of the city in the internal revenue collections in enforcement of the claim of the metropolitan board for the amount due.\n Section 3 of the Organic Act of the Philippine Islands, known as the Jones Law (39 Stat. 545, c. 416; Comp. St.  3810), directs that no money shall be paid out of the treasury, except in pursuance of an appropriation by law; that all money collected on any tax levied or assessed for a special purpose shall be treated as a special fund in the treasury and paid out for such purpose only.\n By section 8 of the same act (Comp. St.  3812) the general legislative power, except as therein otherwise provided, was granted to the Philippine Legislature, authorized by the act.\n The Jones Act describes the duties of the insular auditor as follows:\n'Section 24: 'That there shall be appointed by the President an auditor, who shall examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenues and receipts from whatever source of the Philippine government and of the provincial and municipal governments of the Philippines, including trust funds and funds derived from bond issues, and audit, in accordance with law and administrative regulations, all expenditures of funds or property pertaining to or held in trust by the government of the Provinces \n\n[274 U.S. 41, 413]\n\u00a0\n or municipalities thereof. He shall perform a like duty with respect to all government branches. ...\n\n'The decisions of the auditor shall be final and conclusive upon the executive branches of the government, except that appeal therefrom may be taken by the party aggrieved or the head of the department concerned within one year, in the manner hereinafter prescribed.' Comp. St.  3817d.\n\n Section 25 of the same act provides:\n'That any person aggrieved by the action or decision of the auditor in the settlement of his account or claim may, within one year, take an appeal in writing to the Governor General, .... If the Governor General shall confirm the action of the auditor, he shall so indorse the appeal and transmit it to the auditor, and the action shall thereupon the final and conclusive. Should the Governor General fail to sustain the action of the auditor, he shall forthwith transmit his grounds of disapproval to the Secretary of War,' whose decision is 'final and conclusive.' Comp. St.  3817e.\n\n By section 588 of the Administration Act of 1917, as amended by Act No. 3066, adopted after the passage of the Jones Act, it is provided that the insular auditor shall have the power to authorize and enforce the settlement of accounts subsisting between the different bureaus or offices of the insular service, between such bureau or office and any provincial, municipal, or city government, between provincial governments, between municipal or city governments, and between any such provincial and municipal or city governments.\n The contention on behalf of the insular auditor is that the city of Manila, on the one hand, and the metropolitan water board, on the other, are branches of the insular government, and that by virtue of the foregoing statutes he is given authority to settle accounts between them, and that his decision is final and conclusive upon such executive branches, with the appeal provided as \n\n[274 U.S. 41, 414]\n\u00a0\n above stated. He maintains that this gives him the authority to decide, as between the metropolitan water board and the city of Manila, whether the city should pay the water board for the water furnished it, because it is necessarily involved in the settlement of accounts between the two corporations and branches of the insular government; that, having decided that the money was due for the water furnished from the city to the metropolitan board, he is further charged by section 588 of the Administrative Code with the duty of enforcing that decision and settlement. He may therefore, he says, direct the collector of internal revenue to issue a warrant for such share of the city in the internal revenue collections as may be enough to pay the debt owing from the city to the water board, and that this is a necessary implication from his power by law to enforce such settlement.\n The disposition of the internal revenue receipts is provided by the Administrative Act in the following sections:\n'Sec. 490. Disposition of Internal Revenue in General.-Internal revenue collected under the laws of the Philippine Islands and not applied as hereinabove provided or otherwise specially disposed by the law shall accrue to the Insular Treasury and shall be available for the general purposes of the Government, with the exception of the amounts set apart by way of allotment under the next succeeding section.\n\n'Sec. 491. Allotments of Internal Revenue for Special Purposes.-Of the internal revenue accruing to the Insular Treasury under the preceding section there shall be set apart ten per centum as a provincial allotment, ten per centum as a road and bridge allotment, and twenty per centum as a municipal allotment; but the amounts allotted to said several purposes during any year shall not be greater than the amount allotted for the same purposes during the fiscal year nineteen hundred and nine.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 41, 415]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 492. Appointments and Use of Provincial Allotment.-The provincial allotment shall be apportioned to the treasuries of the several respective provinces and shall there accrue to their general funds, respectively. ...\n'Sec. 494. Apportionment and Use of Municipal Allotment.-The municipal allotment shall be for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Islands in the purview of their community requirements, being available for municipal or other use as hereinbelow provided.\n\n'Sec. 495. The city of Manila shall receive the shares which it would receive if it were both a municipality and a regularly organized province, and for the purposes hereof shall be deemed to be both one and the other. ...\n\n'Sec. 497. Warrants for Quarterly Payment of Allotments.-The payment of the internal revenue allotments shall be made from the insular treasury quarterly, upon warrants drawn by the collector of internal revenue.'\n\n It is apparent from reading the foregoing sections that they are directions by statutory law as to the distribution of the collections made by the internal revenue collector, and that the share to be paid to the city of Manila is fixed thereby, and the exact figure can be ascertained mathematically. This requires no exercise of discretion, judicial or otherwise, after the total amount of the internal revenue receipts are known, and in this case there is no dispute as to that amount. It becomes the ministerial duty of the internal revenue collector to draw his warrant for the share of the city thus fixed by statute. It becomes the duty of the insular auditor, when such a warrant of the internal revenue collector is presented to him, after ascertaining that the amount for which it is drawn is in accord with the directions of the statute, to \n\n[274 U.S. 41, 416]\n\u00a0\n countersign the same. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524; Wright v. Ynchausti, \n272 \nU.S. 640, 651\n, 652 S., 47 S. Ct. 229.\n No matter what the power of the auditor may prove to be with reference to the settlement of accounts as between the city of Manila and the metropolitan water board, or what his power with reference to enforcing the settlement so reached by him, nothing in the laws of the Islands is disclosed to us which enables the auditor in the enforcement of such settlements to dispense with or to suspend the operation of positive law in reference to the course which shall be followed in the disposition by the internal revenue collector of the receipts from internal revenue collections which he is directed by the statute to pay to the city. His duty is clearly set forth, and he has nothing to do but to comply with it, having ascertained exactly what the share of the city is under the foregoing provisions.\n When this share comes to the city under the warrant to be drawn in its favor by the collector, the question of what shall thereafter be done in respect to it is not a matter that we are called upon to consider. Whether the issue between the metropolitan water board and the city of Manila, in the absence of agreement, is one that must then be decided by a suit in court brought by the metropolitan water board against the city, asking for a judgment for the water paid, or whether the issue is to be determined by the insular auditor in his asserted power of settling and enforcing accounts between the two branches of the government, are issues not before us. The only question here is what should be done with the share of the collections made by the internal revenue collector under the sections of the Administrative Code already quoted. By section 2442 of the Laws of the Philippines relating to the City of Manila, there is a provision for a permanent continuing appropriation during the time the city remains the capital of the islands from any \n\n[274 U.S. 41, 417]\n\u00a0\n funds in the insular treasury, not otherwise appropriated, equal to 30 per cent. of the expenses of the city government within certain other limitations and the insular auditor is to ascertain the amount thus appropriated and transfer it to the city. How far this would involve quasi judicial or administrative discretion not to be controlled by mandamus, it is not necessary for us to consider or decide; because this case relates only to internal revenue receipts and their distribution in respect of which the provisions of law are specific and mandatory as we have seen. The conclusion of the Supreme Court of the Philippines in directing a mandamus to issue against the internal revenue collector and the insular auditor was in accordance with the statutory law of the Philippines and was right.\n A majority of the Supreme Court of the Philippines reached this conclusion. That court further expressed an opinion as to the relation of the city of the insular auditor and his functions which was not necessary, it seems to us, to decide this case. We desire therefore to limit our opinion to the mere question whether the city's share of the internal revenue collections must be paid to the city by the collector.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippines is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOSTUM CEREAL CO. v. CALIFORNIA FIG NUT CO.(1927)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward S. Rogers and Frank F. Reed, both of Chicago, Ill., and Wm. J. Hughes, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.[ Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co. \n272 U.S. 693\n (1927) ]\n\n\n[272 U.S. 693, 695]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Postum Cereal Company and its predecessors in title have for years manufactured a cereal breakfast food to which they applied, as a trade-mark, the word 'Grape- \n\n[272 U.S. 693, 696]\n\u00a0\n Nuts,' for which they secured registrations under the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905 (33 Stat. 727,  9 (Comp. St.  9494 )), and amendments. They filed a petition of opposition to the registration by the California Fig Nut Company of the trademark 'Fig Nuts' which that company had registered under the Act of March 19, 1920,  1, par. b, 41 Stat. 533 (Comp. St.  9516a).\n Section 2 of the same act (Comp. St.  9516b) provides that when any person shall deem himself injured by the registration of a trade-mark under the act, he may apply to the Commissioner of Patents to cancel it. Upon due notice to the registrant, a hearing is to be had before an examiner of interferences in the Patent Office, with an appeal to the Commissioner. The California Fig Nut Company, the registrant, filed an answer denying that the petitioner was injured and taking issue within the averments of its petition. The examiner of interferences held against the petitioner and recommended that the registration be not canceled. An appeal was taken to the Commissioner of Patents, who affirmed the holding of the examiner of interferences.\n An appeal was then taken from the decision of the Commissioner to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. That court held that, under the Act of March 19, 1920, 41 Stat. 533, there was no jurisdiction given to that court to hear an appeal from the Commissioner of Patents. This holding was in accordance with a previous decision of the same court in United States Compression Inner Tube Company v. Climax Rubber Company, 53 App. D. C. 370, 290 F. 345. Accordingly the appeal was dismissed. The present appeal to this court was allowed by the Court of Appeals.\n The Trade-Mark Act of 1920, c. 104, 41 Stat. 533, is entitled:\n'An act to give effect to certain provisions of the convention for the protection of trade-marks and commercial names, made and signed in the city of Buenos \n\n[272 U.S. 693, 697]\n\u00a0\n Aires, in the Argentine Republic, August 20, 1910, and for other purposes.'\n\n The first section provides that the Commissioner of Patents shall keep a register of all trade-marks communicated to him by the international bureaus as provided for by the convention upon which a certain fee has been paid. Paragraph (b) of section 1 provides that all other trade-marks not registerable under the Act of February 20, 1905 ( with certain exceptions not here relevant), but which have been in bona fide use for not less than one year in interstate or foreign commerce, upon or in connection with any goods of a proprietor upon which a fee of $ 10 has been paid to the Commissioner of Patents, may be registered under the act, provided that the trade-marks which are identical with the known trade-marks owned and used in interstate commerce by another, and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers, shall not be placed on the register.\n The chief objection of the petitioner to the registration of 'Fig Nuts' as a trade-mark for a cereal breakfast food is that it is likely to cause confusion or mistake and deceive purchasers into thinking they are buying the petitioner's breakfast food marked and widely known as 'grape nuts.'\n Section 6 of the Act of 1920 (Comp. St.  9516f) adopts provisions of certain sections of the Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 728. But those sections do not include section 9 of the older act by which provision is made for an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents to the District Court of Appeals, and for this reason the District Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal. The contention of the appellant here is that section 9 of the act of 1905 does apply to the proceeding here taken under the act of 1920, and that the Court of Appeals in holding otherwise denied a right which the appellant here is entitled to have vindicated. It asks this court to reverse the dismissal by the District Court of Appeals and in effect enforce the jurisdiction of \n\n[272 U.S. 693, 698]\n\u00a0\n that court to entertain its appeal from the Commissioner of Patents.\n The first difficulty the appellant has to meet is the question whether this court has jurisdiction to consider such an appeal. The argument the appellant makes is that this appeal was allowed July 1, 1924, to the judgment of dismissal by the Court of Appeals of April 7, 1924, that the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936, 941), amending section 250 of the Judicial Code, left the old section applicable to such pending appeal, that by the old section 250, any final judgment or decree of the Court of Appeals might be re-examined in this court upon error or appeal in cases in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant, that this appeal draws in question the construction of the Trade-Mark Act of 1920 given by the Court of Appeals, by which that court dismissed the appeal taken to it from the Commissioner of Patents, and that the dismissal from which this appeal was allowed was a final judgment under the cases of Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 40 S. Ct. 221, and Baldwin Co. v. Robertson, \n265 \nU.S. 168\n, 44 S. Ct. 508. The case of Baldwin v. Howard, \n256 \nU.S. 35\n, 41 S. Ct. 405, in which certiorari to this court from a similar trade-mark proceeding was denied is explained by the appellant as resting on the sole ground that the judgment below was not a final one.\n We do not think this course of argument can be sustained. Assuming for the purposes of this discussion, that the District Court of Appeals was wrong in not holding that section 9 of the act of 1905 did apply to the Commissioner of Patents' decision under the Act of 1920, even so, an appeal cannot be taken to this court to remedy the error. The decision of the Court of Appeals under section 9 of the act of 1905 is not a judicial judgment. It is a mere administrative decision. It is merely an instruction to the Commissioner of Patents by a court \n\n[272 U.S. 693, 699]\n\u00a0\n which is made part of the machinery of the Patent Office for administrative purposes. In the exercise of such function it does not enter a judgment binding parties in a case as the term case is used in the third article of the Constitution. Section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, applies to the appeal taken under it the same rules which under section 4914, R. S. (Comp. St.  9459), apply to an appeal taken from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in patent proceedings. Butterworth v. Hoe, \n112 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 5 S. Ct. 25; Gaines v. Knecht, 27 App. D. C. 530, 532; Atkins v. Moore, \n212 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 29 S. Ct. 390. Neither the opinion nor decision of the Court of Appeals under section 4914 R. S., or section 9 of the act of 1905, precludes any person interested from having the right to contest the validity of such patent or trade-mark in any court where it may be called in question. This result prevents an appeal to this court which can only review judicial judgments. This court has so decided in Frasch v. Moore, \n211 \nU.S. 1\n, 29 S. Ct. 6, in an appeal as to patent proceedings, and in Atkins v. Moore, \n212 \nU.S. 285\n, 29 S. Ct. 390, as to appeals in trade-mark proceedings. This was the ratio decidendi of Baldwin v. Howard, \n256 \nU.S. 35\n, 41 S. Ct. 405, already referred to, where both appeal and certiorari were denied in a similar trade-mark proceeding.\n It was said in these cases that the appeal was denied because the action of the Court of Appeals was not a final judgment. This reason was a true one, but it should not be understood to imply that in such a proceeding, circumstances might give it a form that would make it a final judgment subject to review by this court. That is the error that the appellant here has made in pressing its appeal. Appellant relies on Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 40 S. Ct. 221, holding that a judgment of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is a final judgment for purposes of appeal. But the citation has no application in such a case as this. For here the action of the Court of Appeals in its dismissal was dealing with something which even \n\n[272 U.S. 693, 700]\n\u00a0\n if it should have been received, was not in the proper sense a judgment at all. Whatever the form of the action taken in respect of such an appeal, it is not cognizable in this court upon review, because the proceeding is a mere administrative one.\n The distinction between the jurisdiction of this court which is confined to the hearing and decision of cases in the constitutional sense and that of administrative action and decision, power for which may be conferred upon courts of the District is shown in the case of Keller v. Potomac Electric Company, \n261 \nU.S. 428, 440\n, 442 S., 443, 43 S. Ct. 445. There it is pointed out that, while Congress in its constitutional exercise of exclusive legislation over the District may clothe the courts of the District, not only with the jurisdiction and powers of the federal courts in the several states, but also with such authority as a state might confer on her courts (Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Company, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 225\n, 226 S., 29 S. Ct. 67), and so may vest courts of the District with administrative or legislative functions which are not properly judicial, it may not do so with this court, or any federal court established under article 3 of the Constitution. Of the jurisdiction of this court, we said, at page 444 of 261 U. S. (43 S. Ct. 449):\n'Such legislative or administrative jurisdiction, it is well settled, cannot be conferred on this court either directly or by appeal. The latest and fullest authority upon this point is to be found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Day, speaking for the court in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 U.S. 346\n (31 S. Ct. 250). The principle there recognized and enforced on reason and authority is that the jurisdiction of this court and of the inferior courts of the United States ordained and established by Congress under and by virtue of the third article of the Constitution is limited to cases and controversies in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and does not extend to an issue of constitutional law framed by Congress for \n\n[272 U.S. 693, 701]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of invoking the advice of this court without real parties or a real case, or to administrative or legislative issues or controversies.'\n\n See, also, Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70\n, 47 S. Ct. 282, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this day.\n With this limitation upon our powers, it is not difficult to reach a conclusion in the present case. We should have had no power to review the action of the District Court if it had heard the appeal and taken administrative jurisdiction, and by the same token have now no power to review its action in refusing such jurisdiction.\n But it is said that this leaves the appellant without any remedy to review the decision of the District Court of Appeals and makes its conclusion final in respect to the construction of the Trade-Mark Act of 1920. Even if this be so, as to which we express no opinion, it cannot furnish a reason for exceeding the constitutional powers of this court.\n The appeal is dismissed. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOWER MFG. CO. v. SAUNDERS(1927)\nNo. 258\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1927\n\n\nDecided. May 31, 1927.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 490, 491]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George B. Pugh and Thomas S. Buzbee, both of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Wm. R. Donhan, of Little Rock, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to recover for a personal injury sustained by the plaintiff while in the defendant's employ. The plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Ohio, and the defendant was a corporation of that state. Besides its activities in Ohio, the defendant maintained a warehouse at Stuttgart, Ark., where it did a local business. The plaintiff received his injury in that warehouse. The defendant had complied with the conditions on which Arkansas permits foreign corporations to do a local business within her limits, and as part of its compliance had named Stuttgart as its place of business in the state and designated an agent residing there on whom process against it might be served. See Crawford & Moses' Digest 1921,  1826. It did no business and had no office, officer, or agent elsewhere in the state. Stuttgart is in Arkansas county, and is its county seat.\n The action was brought in Saline county, Ark.; service of the summons being made on the defendant's designated agent at Stuttgart. The plaintiff obtained a judgment, which the Supreme Court of the state affirmed (169 Ark. 748, 276 S. W. 599), and the defendant brought the case here on writ of error.\n The Arkansas statutes require actions of this character, if against a domestic corporation, to be brought in a county where it has a place of business or in which its chief officer resides, and, if against a natural person, in \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n a county where he resides or may be found; but they broadly permit such actions, if against a foreign corporation, to be brought in any county in the state. Crawford & Moses' Digest 1921,  1152, 1171, 1176, 1829; Jacks v. Central Coal & Coke Co., 156 Ark. 211, 245  W. 483.\n Another statute (section 1174) permits both foreign corporations and persons residing out of the state to be sued in any county in which they have property or debts owing to them. Attachment and garnishment proceedings, and some others, may be had under it. But it concededly is without application here, and may be put aside. The defendant neither had any property nor owed any debts in the county where it was sued.\n By a timely motion to dismiss the defendant objected to being sued in Saline county and assailed the validity of the statutes, in so far as they permit a foreign corporation to be sued in a county where it does no business and has no office, officer, or agent, on the ground that they are unreasonably discriminatory and arbitrary, and therefore in conflict with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The court of first instance upheld the validity of the statutes and accordingly overruled the motion, and the Supreme Court approved that ruling.\n Thus the statutes were applied as permitting the defendant, a foreign corporation doing business in one county, to be sued in another county, where it did no business and had no office, officer, or agent, on a cause of action which arose in the former. Other counties lay between the two, making the distance from the defendant's place of business to the place of suit 75 miles by railroad and a few miles less by public roads. This, of course, tended to increase materially the burden otherwise incident to presenting a defense.\n It is conceded that the statutes neither permit a domestic corporation to be sued in a county in which it \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n does no business and has no office, officer, or agent, nor permit a natural person to be sued in a county in which he does not reside and is not found. On the contrary, they confine the admissible venue as to both to counties in which the defendant is present in one of the ways just indicated. But a foreign corporation is differently treated. If it be present in a single county, as by having a place of business there, it is made subject to suit, not merely in that county, but in any of the 74 other counties, although it be not present in them in any sense.\n We think it very plain that the statutes discriminate against foreign corporations, and in favor of domestic corporations and individuals, and that the discrimination is not theoretical merely, but real and substantial.\n The clause in the Fourteenth Amendment forbidding a state to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws (Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 333\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Vosburg, \n238 \nU.S. 56, 59\n, 35 S. Ct. 675, L. R. A. 1915E, 953), and extends as well to corporate as to natural persons (Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 522\n, 18 S. Ct. 418; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 154\n, 17 S. Ct. 255; Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 394, 396\n, 6 S. Ct. 1132). It does not prevent a state from adjusting its legislation to differences in situation or forbid classification in that connection, but it does require that the classification be not arbitrary, but based on a real and substantial difference, having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation. Truax v. Corrigan, supra, page 337 (42 S. Ct. 131); Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, supra, 155 (17 S. Ct. 256); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Ft. Smith Light & Power Co. v. Board of Improvement (May 16, 1927) \n274 \nU.S. 387\n, 47 S. Ct. 595\n\n\n No doubt there are subjects as to which corporations admissibly may be classified separately from individuals and accorded different treatment, and also subjects as to \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n which foreign corporations may be classified separately from both individuals and domestic corporations and dealt with differently. But there are other subjects as to which such a course is not admissible; the distinguishing principle being that classification must rest on differences pertinent to the subject in respect of which the classification is made.\n Here the separate classification of foreign corporations is in respect of the venue of place of bringing transitory actions. The statutes mean foreign corporations doing business within the state by her permission, and therefore having a fixed place of business therein and a resident agent on whom process may be served. We speak only of them. So far as their situation has any pertinence to the venue of transitory actions, it is not distinguishable from that of comestic corporations and individuals. Certainly there is no substantial difference. The opinion of the state court does not point to any relevant distinction, nor have counsel suggested any. Of course the restricted venue as to domestic corporations and individuals is prompted by considerations of convenience and economy; but these considerations have equal application to foreign corporations. So far as the plaintiffs in such actions are affected, it is apparent that there is no more reason for a statewide venue when the action is against a foreign corporation than when it is against a domestic corporation or a natural person. So we conclude that the special classification and discriminatory treatment of foreign corporations are without reasonable basis and essentially arbitrary.\n The state court put its decision on the ground that venue is a question of procedure which the state may determine; and counsel for plaintiff advance the further ground that the defendant impliedly assented to the venue provisions by seeking and obtaining permission to do business within the state, the provisions being then \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n on the statute book. But neither ground can be sustained.\n It of course rests with the state to prescribe the venue of actions brought in her courts. But the exercise of this power, as of all others, must be in keeping with the limitations which the Constitution of the United States places on state action. Procedural statutes are not excepted, but must fall like others when in conflict with those limitations. This is illustrated in a recent case where a statute of Arizona forbidding the granting of injunctions in certain situations was held to be in conflict with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and invalid, notwithstanding a contention that it was merely a procedural provision excluding a particular remedy in equity but leaving remedies at law open. Truax v. Corrigan, supra, pages 322, 330 (42 S. Ct. 125, 128). Further illustration is found in a still later case, where a Wisconsin statute subjecting foreign corporations to a burdensome procedural requirement not laid on other litigants was pronounced invalid under the same constitutional provision. Kentucky Finance Corporation v. Paramount Auto Exchange Corporation, \n262 \nU.S. 544\n, 43 S. Ct. 636. And on turning to state decisions we find direct rulings that venue provisions must conform to the equal protection clause and are invalid where they discriminate arbitrarily against either individuals or corporations. Grocers' Fruit Growing Union v. Kern County Land Co., 150 Cal. 466, 474, 475, 89 P. 120; McClung v. Pulitizer Publishing Co., 279 Mo. 370, 214 S. W. 193.\n The case of Cincinnati Street Ry. Co. v. Snell, \n193 \nU.S. 30\n, 24 S. Ct. 319, is cited as if venue provisions were there held to be beyond the reach of the equal protection clause. But this is a strained and inadmissible interpretation. That was an action by an individual against a corporation which was begun, conformably to a general statutory requirement, in the county where the defendant had its principal office and was engaged in business. Another stat- \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n ute authorized the court to change the venue in such an action 'to the adjacent county most convenient to both parties,' if it appeared that the corporation had more than 50 local stockholders, and if it was also shown by the affidavit of the other party, supported by 5 credible citizens, that he could not have a fair and impartial trial in the county where the suit was begun. A showing was made which brought the case within the statute, and the court changed the venue over the defendant's objection that the statute operated unequally and was invalid, in that it permitted the other party, but not the corporation, to secure the change. The statute doubtless proceeded on the assumption, first, that a corporation with many local stockholders might have such influence in the county that the other party would be at a serious disadvantage, unless provision were made whereby the court, on an adequate showing, might change the place of trial to another county free from such influence and as convenient as might be to both parties; and, secondly, that the corporation was not likely to suffer any prejudice in its home county through having many stockholders there. At all events the difference in the situation of the parties and the relation of that difference to the matter of changing the place of trial were such that it could not be said of such discrimination as was shown in the statute that it was without a reasonable and adequate basis. The opinion affirmatively shows that the defendant was not objecting to the place designated by the court for the trial, but only that the statute did not accord it an equal opportunity to secure a change from the county where the action was begun. When the opinion is examined with the actual situation in mind it has little bearing on the case now before us.\n The contention advanced by counsel for the plaintiff that the defendant impliedly assented to the venue pro- \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n visions is answered and refuted by repeated decisions holding that a foreign corporation by seeking and obtaining permission to do business in a state does not thereby become obligated to comply with, or estopped from objecting to, any provision in the state statutes which is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. The principal cases are cited and reviewed in Hanover Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 U.S. 494\n, 507, et seq., 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713, and Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission of California, \n271 U.S. 583\n, 594, et seq., 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457. To them may be added the case of W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452, 468\n, 21 S. Ct. 423, 429 (45 L. Ed. 619), where it was held that:\n'The acceptance of a license, in whatever form, will not impose upon the licensee an obligation to respect or to comply with any provisions of the statute ... that are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n We accordingly reach the conclusion that the defendant's objection before stated to the validity of the venue provisions was well taken and should have been sustained under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n In order to enter into most of the relations of life people have to give up some of their Constitutional rights. If a man makes a contract he gives up the Constitutional right that previously he had to be free from the hamper that he puts upon himself. Some rights, no doubt, a person is not allowed to renounce, but very many he may. So we must go further than merely to point to the Fourteenth Amendment. I see nothing in it to prevent a foreign corporation agreeing with the State that it will be subject to the general law of torts and will submit to a transitory action wherever it may be sued. That the \n\n[274 U.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n venue for suits against domestic corporations is limited by statute seems to me not enough to invalidate its assent. Every contract is the acceptance of some inequality-and under our decisions I think it cannot be denied that the plaintiff in error did contract. Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., \n243 \nU.S. 93, 96\n, 37 S. Ct. 344. The jurisdiction of the Court would have been unquestionable if it had not been objected to, and I do not see why consent could not be manifested by contract as well as by silence. While we adhere to the rule that a State may exclude foreign corporations altogether it seems to me a mistake to apply the inequality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment with meticulous nicety. The Amendment has been held not to overthrow ancient practices even when hard to reconcile with justice. I think there are stronger grounds for not reducing the power of the States to attach conditions to a consent that they have a right to refuse, when there is no attempt to use the conditions to invade forbidden fields.\n Apart from the contract of the corporation there seems to me a ground for discrimination that ought to be respected when it has satisfied the State. A statute has to be drawn with reference to what is usual and probable. A foreign corporation merely doing business in the State and having its works elsewhere will be more or less inconvenienced by being sued anywhere away from its headquarters, but the difference to it between one county and another is likely to be less than it will be to a corporation having its headquarters in the State. So I repeat that in my opinion the plaintiff in error cannot complain if the State holds it liable to a transitory action wherever it may be served and sued, as it would have been liable at common law.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC UTIL. COMMISSION v. ATTLEBORO STEAM & ELECTRIC CO.(1927)\nNo. 217\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 83, 84]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. W. Boyden, of Boston, Mass., Arthur M. Allen and Charles P. Sisson, both of Providence, R. I., and Frank D. Comerford, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Robert G. Dodge, of Boston, Mass., Archibald C. Matteson, of Providence, R. I., and Harold S. Davis, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the constitutional validity of an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Rhode Island putting into effect a schedule of prices applying to the sale of electric current in interstate commerce.\n The Narragansett Electric Lighting Company is a Rhode Island corporation engaged in manufacturing electric current at its generating plant in the city of Providence and selling such current generally for light, heat and power. The Attleboro Steam & Electric Company is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in supplying electric current for public and private use in the city of Attleboro and its vicinity in that state.\n In 1917 these companies entered into a contract by which the Narragansett Company agreed to sell, and the Attleboro Company to buy, for a period of twenty years, all the electricity required by the Attleboro Company for its own use and for sale in the city of Attleboro and the adjacent territory, at a specified basic rate; the current to be delivered by the Narragansett Company at the state line between Rhode Island and Massachusetts and carried over connecting transmission lines to the station of the Attleboro Company in Massachusetts, where it was to be metered. The Narragansett Company filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Rhode Island a schedule setting out the rate and general terms of the contract and was authorized by the Commission to grant the \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n Attleboro Company the special rate therein shown; and the two companies then entered upon the performance of the contract. Current was thereafter supplied in accordance with its terms; and the generating plant of the Attleboro Company was dismantled.\n In 1924 the Narragansett Company-having previously made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain an increase of the special rate to the Attleboro Company 1-filed with the Rhode Island Commission a new schedule, purporting to cancel the original schedule and establish an increased rate for electric current supplied, in specified minimum quantities, to electric lighting companies for their own use or sale to their customers and delivered either in Rhode Island or at the state line.\n The Attleboro Company was in fact the only customer of the Narragansett Company to which this new schedule would apply. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission thereupon instituted an investigation as to the contract rate and the proposed rate. After a hearing at which both companies were represented, the Commission found that, owing principally to the increased cost of generating electricity, the Narragansett Company in rendering service to the Attleboro Company was suffering an operating loss, without any return on the investment devoted to such service, while the rates to \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n its other customers yielded a fair return; that the contract rate was unreasonable and a continuance of service to the Attleboro Company under it would be detrimental to the general public welfare and prevent the Narragansett Company from performing its full duty to its other customers; 3 and that the proposed rate was reasonable and would yield a fair return, and no more, for the service to the Attleboro Company. And the Commission thereupon made an order putting into effect the rate contained in the new schedule.\n From this order the Attleboro Company prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court of Rhode Island which-considering only one of the various objections urged-held, on the authority of Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S. Ct. 544, that the order of the Commission imposed a direct burden on interstate commerce and was invalid because of conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution; and entered a decree reversing the order and directing that the rate investigation be dismissed. 46 R. I. 496, 129 A. 495.\n It is conceded, rightly, that the sale of electric current by the Narragansett Company to the Attleboro Company is a transaction in interstate commerce, notwithstanding the fact that the current is delivered at the state line. The transmission of electric current from one state to another, like that of gas, is interstate commerce, Coal & Coke Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 84 W. Va. 662, 669, 100 S. E. 557, 7 A. L. R. 108, and its essential character is not affected by a passing of custody and title at the state boundary not arresting the continuous transmission to the intended destination. People's Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n270 \nU.S. 550, 554\n, 46 S. Ct. 371. \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 87]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners contend, however, that the Rhode Island Commission cannot effectively exercise its power to regulate the rates for electricity furnished by the Narragansett Company to local consumers, without also regulating the rates for the other service which it furnishes; that if the Narragansett Company continues to furnish electricity to the Atteboro Company at a loss this will tend to increase the burden on the local consumers and impair the ability of the Narragansett Company to give them good service at reasonable prices; and that, therefore, the order of the Commission prescribing a reasonable rate for the interstate service to the Attleboro Company should be sustained as being essentially a local regulation, necessary to the protection of matters of local interest, and affecting interstate commerce only indirectly and incidentally. In support of this contention they rely chiefly upon Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Com., \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S. Ct. 279; and the controlling question presented is whether the present case comes within the rule of the Pennsylvania Gas Co. Case or that of the Kansas Gas Co. Case upon which the Attleboro Company relies.\n In the Pennsylvania Gas Co. Case, the company transmitted natural gas by a main pipe line from the source of supply in Pennsylvania to a point of distribution in a city in New York, which it there subdivided and sold at retail to local consumers supplied from the main by pipes laid through the streets of the city. In holding that the New York Public Service Commission might regulate the rate charged to these consumers, the court said that while a state may not 'directly' regulate or burden interstate commerce, it may in some instances, until the subjectmatter is regulated by Congress, pass laws 'indirectly' affecting such commerce, when needed to protect or regulate matters of local interest; that the thing which the New York Commission had undertaken to regulate, while part of an interstate transmission, was 'local in its na- \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 88]\n\u00a0\n ture,' pertaining to the furnishing of gas to local consumers, and the service rendered to them was 'essentially local,' being similar to that of a local plant furnishing gas to consumers in a city; and that such 'local service' was not of the character which required general dn uniform regulation of rates by congressional action, even if the local rates might 'affect' the interstate business of the company.\n In the Kansas Gas Co. Case the company, whose business was principally interstate, transported natural gas by continuous pipe lines from wells in Oklahoma and Kansas into Missouri, and there sold and delivered it to distributing companies, which then sold and delivered it to local consumers. In holding that the rate which the company charged for the gas sold to the distributing companies-those at which these companies sold to the local consumers not being involved-was not subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission of Missouri, the court said that, while in the absence of congressional action a state may generally enact laws of internal police, although they have an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, 'the commerce clause of the Constitution, of its own force, restrains the states from imposing direct burdens upon interstate commerce,' and a state enactment imposing such a 'direct burden' must fall, being a direct restraint of that which in the absence of federal regulation should be free, Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 396\n, 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; that the sale and delivery to the distributing companies was 'an inseparable part of a transaction in interstate commerce-not local but essentially national in character-and enforcement of a selling price in such a transaction places a direct burden upon such commerce inconsistent with that freedom of interstate trade which it was the purpose of the commerce clause of secure and perserve;' that in the Pennsylvania Gas Co. Case the decision rested on the ground that the serv- \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 89]\n\u00a0\n ice to the consumers for which the regulated charge was made, was 'essentially local,' and the things done were after the business in its essentially national aspect had come to an end-the supplying of local consumers being 'a local business,' even though the gas be brought from another state, in which the local interest is paramount and the interference with interstate commerce, if any, indirect and of minor importance; but that in the sale of gas in wholesale quantities, not to consumers, but to distributing companies for resale to consumers, where the transportation, sale and delivery constitutes an unbroken chain, fundamentally interstate from beginning to end, 'the paramount interest is not local but national, admitting of and requiring uniformity of regulation,' which, 'even though it be the uniformity of governmental nonaction, may be highly necessary to preserve equality of opportunity and treatment among the various communities and states concerned.'\n It is clear that the present case is controlled by the Kansas Gas Co. Case. The order of the Rhode Island Commission is not, as in the Pennsylvania Gas Co. Case, a regulation of the rates charged to local consumers, having merely an incidental effect upon interstate commerce, but is a regulation of the rates charged by the Narragansett Company for the interstate service to the Attleboro Company, which places a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Being the imposition of a direct burden upon interstate commerce, from which the state is restrained by the force of the commerce clause, it must necessarily fall, regardless of its purpose. Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 199\n, 45 S. Ct. 481; Real Silk Mills v. Portland, \n268 \nU.S. 325, 336\n, 45 S. Ct. 525; Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34\n, 47 S. Ct. 267, 71 L. Ed. -, this day decided. It is immaterial that the Narragansett Company is a Rhode Island corporation subject to regulation by the Commission in its local business, or that Rhode Island is the state from which the electric current is transmitted \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 90]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce, and not that in which it is received, as in the Kansas Gas Co. Case. The forwarding state obviously has no more authority than the receiving state to place a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 596\n, 43 S. Ct. 658, 32 A. L. R. 300. Nor is it material that the general business of the Narragansett Company appears to be chiefly local, while in the Kansas Gas Co. Case the company was principally engaged in interstate business. The test of the validity of a state regulation is not the character of the general business of the company, but whether the particular business which is regulated is essentially local or national in character; and if the regulation places a direct burden upon its interstate business it is none the less beyond the power of the state because this may be the smaller part of its general business. Furthermore, if Rhode Island could place a direct burden upon the interstate business of the Narragansett Company because this would result in indirect benefit to the customers of the Narragansett Company in Rhode Island, Massachusetts could, by parity of reasoning, reduce the rates on such interstate business in order to benefit the customers of the Attleboro Company in that state, who would have, in the aggregate, an interest in the interstate rate correlative to that of the customers of the Narragansett Company in Rhode Island. Plainly, however, the paramount interest in the interstate business carried on between the two companies is not local to either state, but is essentially national in character. The rate is therefore not subject to regulation by either of the two states in the guise of protection to their respective local interests; but, if such regulation is required it can only be attained by the exercise of the power vested in Congress. See Covington Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n154 \nU.S. 204, 220\n, 14 S. Ct. 1087; Hanley v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., \n187 \nU.S. 617, 620\n, 23 S. Ct. 214.\n The decree is accordingly affirmed. \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The business of the Narragansett Company is an intrastate one. The only electricity sold for use without the state is that agreed to be delivered to the Attleboro Company. That company takes less than 3 per cent. of the electricity produced and manufactured by the Narragansett, which has over 70,000 customers in Rhode Island. The problem is essentially local in character. The Commission found as a fact that continuance of the service to the Attleboro Company at the existing rate would prevent the Narragansett from performing its full duty towards its other customers and would be detrimental to the general public welfare. It issued the order specifically to prevent unjust discrimination and to prevent unjust increase in the price to other customers. The Narragansett, a public service corporation of Rhode Island, is subject to regulation by that state. The order complained of is clearly valid as an exercise of the police power, unless it violates the commerce clause.\n The power of the state to regulate the selling price of electricity produced and distributed by it within the state and to prevent discrimination is not affected by the fact that the supply is furnished under a longterm contract. Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 \nU.S. 372\n, 39 S. Ct. 117, 9 A. L. R. 1420. If the commission lacks the power exercised, it is solely because the electricity is delivered for use in another state. That fact makes the transaction interstate commerce, and Congress has power to legislate on the subject. It has not done so, nor has it legislated on any allied subject, so there can be no contention that it has occupied the field. Nor is this a case in which it can be said that the silence of Congress is a command that the Rhode Island utility shall remain free from the public regulation-that it shall be free to discriminate against the citizens of the state by which it was incorporated and in which it does business. That \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 92]\n\u00a0\n state may not, of course, obstruct or directly burden interstate commerce. But to prevent discrimination in the price of electricity wherever used does not obstruct or place a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Such regulation or action is unlike the burden imposed where a transportation rate is fixed, Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific R. Co. v. Illinois, \n118 \nU.S. 557\n, 7 S. Ct. 4; or where property moving in interstate commerce is taxed. Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattleboro, \n260 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S. Ct. 146, 25 A. L. R. 1195. The burden resulting from the order here in question resembles more nearly that increase in the cost of an article produced and to be delivered which arises by reason of higher taxes laid upon plant, operations or profits, Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, \n198 \nU.S. 299, 305\n, 25 S. Ct. 686, 3 Ann. Cas. 1100; American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S. Ct. 522; or which arises by reason of expenditures required under police regulations. Pittsburg & Southern Coal Co. v. Louisiana, \n156 \nU.S. 590\n, 15 S. Ct. 459; Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52\n, 35 S. Ct. 501; Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 \nU.S. 365, 368\n, 39 S. Ct. 114. It is like the regulation sustained in Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S. Ct. 279, where an order of the New York Public Service Commission fixed the rates at which gas piped from without the state and delivered directly to the consumers might be sold.\n The case at bar seems to me distinguishable from others in which the state regulation has been held precluded by the commerce clause. In Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S. Ct. 544, this court held void a regulation which fixed the rates at which gas piped from without the state and delivered to distributing companies could be sold to the latter. The Pennsylvania Gas Co. Case was distinguished, in that there 'the things done were local. ... The business of supplying, on demand, local consumers is a local business, even though the gas be brought from another state and drawn for distribution directly from interstate mains. ... In such case the local interest \n\n[273 U.S. 83, 93]\n\u00a0\n is paramount. ... But here the sale of gas is in wholesale quantities, not to consumers, but to distributing companies for resale to consumers in numerous cities ... in different states. ... The paramount interest is not local but national. ...' Page 309 (44 S. Ct. 546). It was there emphasized that the 'business of the Supply Company, with an exception not important here, (was) wholly interstate.' Page 306 (44 S. Ct. 545). In Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 192\n, 45 S. Ct. 481, 482 (69 L. Ed. 909) where a North Dakota regulation was held invalid, 'about 90 per cent. (of the wheat was) sold within the state to buyers who purchase for shipment, and ship, to terminal markets outside the state' and the 'price paid at the country elevators rises and falls with the price at the terminal markets.' In these two cases the burden was deemed a direct one because the businesses were essentially interstate. In Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553\n, 43 S. Ct. 658. 32 A. L. R. 300, the state regulation was held void as discriminating against interstate commerce.\n In my opinion the judgment below should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1921 the Commission had authorized the Narragansett Company to put into effect a schedule increasing the special rate to the Attleboro Company; but its enforcement had been enjoined on the ground of the lack of an essential finding by the Commission. Attleboro Steam & E. Co. v. Narragansett E. Light Co. (D. C.) 295 F. 895. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] No other electric lighting company supplied by the Narragansett Company required, either then or prospectively, the quantity of current necessary to make the proposed rate applicable. The Commission stated that the Attleboro Company was the only customer of the Narragansett Company affected by the proposed rate; and the brief for the petitioners states that the Attleboro Company was the only customer then falling within the schedule class. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The evidence showed that in 1923 the Narragansett Company had 71, 554 customers, and that about one thirty-fifth of the current which it produced went to the Attleboro Company. \n\n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUEBLO OF SANTA ROSA v.

C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Our order granting the writ of certiorari in this case directed a hearing on the issue as to the existence of authority of counsel who filed the bill to represent complainant. That hearing now has been had.\n The suit is brought to enjoin respondents from offering, listing or disposing of certain lands in Arizona as public lands of the United States. The case was here before on appeal (Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, \n249 \nU.S. 110\n, 39 S. Ct. 185), and was remanded to the District Supreme Court, with directions to overrule a motion to dismiss on the merits and allow defendants to answer the bill. After receipt of the mandate, an answer was filed denying the allegations of the bill and alleging, among other things, that the so-called pueblo had never authorized the suit or ratified or approved the acts of the attorneys in bringing or prosecuting it; and upon that ground, a motion to dismiss, supported by affidavits, was filed at the same time. After a hearing upon the motion, the trial court postponed a decision until final hearing; and the taking of testimony was proceeded with, much of it relating to was issue now before this court. \n\n[273 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n The record is a long one, but the pertinent facts may be shortly stated. About the year 1880, deeds were drawn and acknowledged by a number of Indians, conveying to one Hunter, as trustee, an interest in the lands, grants, and privileges of certain named villages. Among these deeds was one which purported to be made by 'Luis, captain of the village or pueblo of Santa Rosa,' for himself and inhabitants of that village and others, and to convey an undivided half interest in 720 square miles of land. At the same time, powers of attorney were executed by the various grantors. The only one with which we are here concerned is that given by Luis, the terms of which, we assume for present purposes, were sufficient to authorize Hunter to bring and maintain an suit like the present. It granted to Hunter powers of delegation, substitution, and revocation, and recited that, as it was 'accompanied with an interest, ... it is hereby made irrevocable.' While Hunter was authorized to render services in establishing the claim of the Indians to the lands, it does not appear that he agreed to do so unless by implication merely; nor does it appear that there was any other consideration for the conveyance.\n In 1911, Hunter entered into contracts with one Martin, by which the latter was to undertake to establish the Indian title and make certain cash payments in consideration of the conveyance to him of an undivided three-fourths interest in the lands which would fall to Hunter upon a partition between himself and the Indians. The same year, and long after the death of Luis, Hunter executed a delegation of his powers to one Cates. Hunter died in 1912, and this suit was brought in 1914 by a firm of lawyers of which Cates was a member. Cates died in 1920, several years before the motion to dismiss was heard in the court of first instance.\n The Luis deed was not recorded in the counties where the lands are situated until 34 years after its execution \n\n[273 U.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n and 2 years after the death of Hunter, the grantee. The delay is not explained. Careful and comprehensive inquiries, conducted among the Indians over a period of several years, failed to disclose any one who knew of any authority from the Indians to bring or maintain the suit. Among them were contemporaries of Luis, but none had ever heard of the deed or the power; and it is made clear that these instruments properly could not have been executed or any interest of the Indians conveyed without previous deliberation for that purpose on the part of the Indians in council, and that no such council was ever assembled. The evidence further shows that no suit properly could have been brought without the prior consent of the Indians in council, and that no council for that purpose was ever assembled. The attitude of the government seems to have been that the lands claimed are public lands, subject only to the ordinary right of Indian occupancy.\n Early in the year 1922, after consideration, 181 of the 195 adult male inhabitants of the villages said to form the pueblo of Santa Rosa signed a petition declaring that none of them knew about the suit until after it was brought or gave any one a right to bring it, and that none of them approves of it, or wants it to go on, and requesting 'that this suit, which we do not want, and with which we have nothing to do, be dismissed.'\n The court of first instance, assuming, without deciding, that the plaintiff was a pueblo as set forth in the bill and owned the lands in question, held that it had never authorized the bringing or maintenance of the suit, and that it did not have, under any law or by any custom, usage, or tradition, the power to make the conveyance or power of attorney in question, and entered a decree dismissing the bill. The Court of Appeals disapproved the holding of the court of first instance upon the question of authority to bring the suit, on the ground that a chal- \n\n[273 U.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n lenge to the right of counsel to appear is a preliminary matter, to be disposed of before proceeding to the merits, but affirmed the order of dismissal upon the merits. 12 F.(2d) 332. In this we think that court erred.\n The question as to the authority of counsel was raised by motion to dismiss filed with the answer. There was a hearing upon the motion, but the trial court of its own accord postponed a decision upon it until final hearing on the merits, an order clearly within its discretion. Whether, as a matter of practice, the challenge to the authority of counsel was seasonably interposed, it is not important to decide, for in any event the trial court, or this court, has power, at any stage of the case, to require an attorney, one of its officers, to show his authority to appear. In The King of Spain v. Oliver, Fed. Cas. No. 7,814, 2 Wash. C. C. 429, 430, Mr. Justice Washington, sitting in the Circuit Court said:\n'... It would be strange, if a court whose duty it is to superintend the conduct of its officers, should not have the power to inquire by what authority an attorney of that court undertakes to sue or to defend, in the name of another-whether that other is a real or fictitious person, and whether its process is used for the purpose of vexation or fraud, instead of that for which alone it is intended. The only question can be, as to the time and manner of calling for the authority, and as to the remedy, which are in the discretion of the court, and ought to be adapted to the case.'\n\n See, also, W. A. Gage & Co. v. Bell (D. C.) 124 F. 371, 380; McKiernan et al. v. Patrick et al., 4 How, (Miss.) 333, 335; Clark v. Willett, 35 Cal. 534, 539, 541; Miller v. Assurance Co., 233 Mo. 91, 99, 134 S.

Long, 123 Cal. 107, 113, 55 P. 708.\n To justify the conclusion that there was no authority to bring or maintain the suit really needs nothing beyond the foregoing short recital of the facts. That Luis was without power to execute the papers in question, for lack \n\n[273 U.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n of authority from the Indian council, in our opinion is well established. Indeed, there is no evidence to the contrary worthy of serious consideration. The rights of Indians, unlettered and under national wardship, are here involved, and a deed purporting to convey their half interest in an enormous tract of country, without consideration, aside from some indefinite and doubtful promise to establish their claim against the government, is upon its face so improvident as to call for affirmative proof of authority of the clearest kind. Instead of this, we have no affirmative evidence of a substantial character, and the suspicious circumstance of long unexplained delay in recording the deed and power, and in bringing the suit.\n But, wholly aside from this, the conveyance and the power were both void by force of sections 2103 and 2116 Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4087, 4100). The first of these sections provides that any agreement with any tribe of Indians for the payment or delivery of anything of value in present or in prospective, in consideration of services for such Indians relative to their lands, is void, unless, among other requirements, the agreement is in writing, executed before a judge of a court or record, bears the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs indorsed upon it, and contains the names of all parties in interest, their residence and occupation; and further that, 'if made with a tribe, by their tribal authorities, the scope of authority and the reason for exercising that authority, shall be given specifically.' Section 2116 declares that no 'conveyance of lands, or of any title or claim thereto, from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the Constitution.' These sections apply here, whether the Indians concerned are to be classified as nomadic or Pueblo Indians. United States v. Candelaria, \n271 \nU.S. 432, 441\n, 442 S., 46 S. Ct. 561. None of their requirements can be dispensed with, \n\n[273 U.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n and it does not appear that in respect of most of them there was even an attempt to comply. See, and compare, Green v. Menominee Tribe, \n233 \nU.S. 588, 568\n, 34 S. Ct. 706. Lease of Indian Lands for Grazing Purposes, 18 Op. Attys. Gen. 235, 237; Indian Contract, Id. 497.\n We agree with the conclusions of the court of first instance, but are of opinion that the dismissal should have been, not upon the merits, but without prejudice to a suit, if properly brought. The decrees of both courts, therefore, are erroneous, and the cause must be remanded to the court of first instance, with directions to dismiss the bill, on the ground that the suit was brought by counsel without authority, but without prejudice to the bringing of any other suit hereafter, by and with the authority of the alleged pueblo of Santa Rosa. Other grounds appearing from the record, which would lead to the same result, we pass without consideration.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nQUON QUON POY v. JOHNSON(1927)\nNo. 68\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 352, 353]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Warren Ozro Kyle, of Boston, Mass., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Quon Quon Poy, a Chinese boy fifteen years of age, arrived at the port of Boston in June, 1924, and applied for admission to the United States, claiming to be a foreign-born son of Quon Mee Sing, a native-born citizen-whose citizenship was conceded-and, hence under R. S.  19931 (U. S. C. tit. 8,  6 being Comp. St.  3947), to be himself a citizen of the \n\n[273 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n United States. After a preliminary investigation by an inspector, his claim was heard, under the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1917,2 by a Board of Special Inquiry, which decided, on the evidence, that he was not shown to be the son of Quon Mee Sing, and should be excluded as a Chinese alien not a member of any of the exempt classes entitled to enter the United States. On an appeal to the Secretary of Labor-this finding having been approved by the Board of Review-the Secretary sustained the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry; and a deportation warrant was issued to the Commissioner of Immigration.\n The applicant then presented to the District Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was the son of Quon Mee Sing and a citizen of the United States; that he had been denied a fair hearing and opportunity to establish his citizenship by the Department of Labor; that the procedure in the Department by which he had been declared an alien denied him the due process of law to which he was entitled under the Constitution; and that under his claim to citizenship he was entitled to an adjudication by the court as to such procedure and as to his relationship to Quon Mee Sing. The writ was granted. Upon a hearing on the petition and return, in which the record of the Departmental proceedings was introduced, the court, finding that the Departmental decision was conclusive as to the petitioner's citizenship, \n\n[273 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n declined to hear witnesses offered by him for the purpose of independently establishing his citizenship; and entered judgment discharging the writ and remanding the petitioner to the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration. This direct appeal was then allowed under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), prior to the Jurisdictional Act of 1925 ( 43 Stat. 938).\n\n 1. \nThe contention that the petitioner was denied a fair hearing as to his citizenship by the Department of Labor, cannot be sustained. The record shows that in September the inspector to whom the case was referred in its preliminary stage, separately examined, under oath and at length, the petitioner, and his alleged father and an alleged brother who offered themselves as witnesses. Their examination, which was by question and answer, was taken down and is in the record. It was conducted in an entirely fair and impartial manner. Each of them stated at the conclusion of his examination that he had nothing further to say; and no other witnesses offered themselves or were produced. The petitioner was intelligent, had attended school, and stated that he thoroughly understood the interpreter. At the close of this preliminary investigation the case was immediately referred to the Board of Special Inquiry, consisting of the same inspector, and two others. At the commencement of the hearing before the Board the petitioner was informed of his right to have a relative or friend present, and stated that he did not desire to avail himself of this right and was willing to proceed with the hearing. He was also informed that the previous testimony given by himself and his alleged father and brother would be made a part of the proceedings before the Board; to which he made no objection. The petitioner was then further examined by the Board. After a postponement for the purpose of obtaining a report as to the physical condition of the petitioner, the Board resumed its hearing, the petitioner being again present; and after consideration of the entire testimony, being of opinion that his relation- \n\n[273 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n ship to Quon Mee Sing had not been reasonably established, voted to accord him five days in which to submit additional evidence. Notice of this was sent to the attorney representing the petitioner-who had not been present at any of the proceedings-and he replied that the petitioner had no further testimony to offer. The Board then recalled the petitioner for further examination-after which he stated that he had nothing further to say-and again decided that his claimed relationship to Quon Mee Sing had not been reasonably established and that he should be excluded; and informed him of his right to appeal to the Secretary of Labor.\n This appeal having been taken, the Board of Review, after hearing the attorney for the petitioner, made a report in which it reviewed the entire testimony, found that the record was 'exceptionally unfavorable' to the petitioner, and-after referring to his lack of knowledge of matters which clearly should have been within his memory, his unsatisfactory explanations, the discrepancies between his statements and those of his alleged father and brother, and to a previous statement by his alleged father to the effect that he had no such son-concluded that the petitioner had fallen 'far short' of establishing that he was in truth and fact the son of Quon Mee Sing; and accordingly recommended that the exclusion decision be affirmed.\n The entire record discloses a painstaking and impartial effort to ascertain the merits of the petitioner's claim. There is no contention here that the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry had no adequate support in the evidence. The arguments made as to the unfairness of the hearing-in so far as they are based upon anything properly appearing in the record before us-relate to the delay in commencing the hearing, the absence of a friend or relative of the petitioner at the hearing, and the introduction before the Board of the testimony previously taken by the \n\n[273 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n single inspector. These are not well taken. Clearly the mere delay in the commencement of the investigation-although involving the detention of the petitioner-had no bearing upon the fairness of the hearing itself. The argument as to the necessity for the presence of a kinsman or friend of the petitioner at the hearing, is based upon the provision in section 17 of the Immigration Act that while the hearing 'shall be separate and apart from the public,' the applicant for admission 'may have one friend or relative present under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.' Here, however, the Board, at the outset of the hearing, informed the petitioner of his right to have a relative or friend present; and he expressly waived this right and stated that he was willing to proceed with the hearing. And see United States .v Sing Tuck, \n194 \nU.S. 169\n, 24 S. Ct. 621. The contention that the hearing was invalid because the greater part of the testimony was taken before a single inspector and introduced before the Board, is based upon a provision in the same section of the Act that on an appeal from the Board of Special Inquiry the decision shall be rendered 'solely upon the evidence adduced before the Board.' There is, however, no suggestion whatever in the Act that the evidence adduced before the Board of Special Inquiry must be taken in its presence. We see no reason to doubt that evidence properly taken before an inspector, section 16,-which has substantially the same effect as a deposition taken in an ordinary case- may be introduced before the Board and considered by it. See Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 \nU.S. 454, 458\n, 40 S. Ct. 566. And here the petitioner offered no objection to the introduction of such testimony and no application was made to recall the witnesses for re-examination by the Board.\n\n 2. \nIt is also contended that as the petitioner claimed the right of admission to the United States as a citizen thereof under R. S.  1993, the Immigration Act, in vest- \n\n[273 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n ing in the Board of Special Inquiry the authority to determine the question of his citizenship and making its decision when approved by the Secretary of Labor final, is unconstitutional, in that it deprives him of the right to a judicial hearing to which he is entitled as due process under the Constitution; and that it was therefore the duty of the District Court to proceed, independently of the Departmental decision, to an adjudication as to his citizenship. It is clear, however, in the light of the previous decisions of this Court, that when the petitioner, who had never resided in the United States, presented himself at its border for admission, the mere fact that he claimed to be a citizen did not entitle him under the Constitution to a judicial hearing; and that unless it appeared that the Departmental officers to whom Congress had entrusted the decision of his claim, had denied him an opportunity to establish his citizenship, at a fair hearing, or acted in some unlawful or improper way or abused their discretion, their finding upon the question of citizenship was conclusive and not subject to review, and it was the duty of the court to dismiss the writ of habeas corpus without proceeding further.

Ct. 492.\n\n 3. \nIt is also urged in argument that, apart from the petitioner's own claim, Quon Mee Sing was independently entitled to maintain the petition for habeas corpus in enforce ment of his right to the custody of a minor child, and to obtain to that end an adjudication of his kinship to the petitioner. It suffices to say that no such question is here presented. The petition was filed solely in the right of the petitioner. No right was asserted in behalf of Quon Mee Sing. No such question appears to have been presented in the hearing in the District Court; and none was raised by the assignments of error. \n\n[273 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the District Court must accordingly be affirmed. But the Court being advised that the appellee, the Commissioner of Immigration, has died since December 10, 1926, the day on which this case was argued and submitted, the judgment here will be entered nunc pro tunc as of that day.

CO.(1927)\nNo. 228\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 625, 626]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. B. Richards, of Duluth, Minn., and E. C. Carman and Clifford L. Hilton, both of St. Paul, Minn., for appellants.\n Mr. Oscar Mitchell, of Duluth, Minn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court in favor of the plaintiff, the appellee, that prohibits the enforcing of a rate for the carriage of passengers established by the appealing Commission and authorizes the plaintiff to charge not exceeding six cents for carrying passengers within the City of Duluth, subject to conditions not needing mention. 4 F.(2d) 543. The Commission's order allowed a charge of six cents for a single fare but required the plaintiff to issue tickets or tokens at not to exceed twenty-five cents for five rides. The difference, it will be seen, is somewhat narrow and the only question that we have any need to consider is whether the plaintiff had a right to come into the Court of the United States when it did, and whether its suit was not at least premature.\n The plaintiff, an existing street railway company, elected to comply with and come under to terms of Chapter 278, General Laws of Minnesota 1921, by filing the declaration and consent required. Thereby it gained a right to apply to the above-mentioned Commission to fix the rates of fare to be charged in place of the five cents \n\n[273 U.S. 625, 627]\n\u00a0\n to which it had been limited before it came in under the Act. It applied to the Commission; the City of Duluth was made a party; and after a hearing the Commission determined the value of the plaintiff's property used and useful in the street car service in Duluth, found that a return of seven and one-half per cent. was a reasonable rate of return, and fixed the fares that we have stated as sufficient to yield that rate. This was on July 13, 1922. Five days later the plaintiff filed this bill, setting up that the Commission's order was confiscatory and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The objections to the bill are based on the provisions of the Minnesota statute for an appeal. Both the city and the street railway are given the right to appeal to the District Court of the county, and there the whole matter, fact and law, is to be tried before three judges, without a jury. They are to find all material facts, including the fair value of the property and the reasonable rate of return, and to affirm, modify or reverse the order of the Commission, as may be required by law, the Commission being directed to conform to their judgment in its final order. There is a further resort to the Supreme Court. It is said that plaintiff was bound to exhaust the appeal thus granted before going elsewhere, and that it could not cut off the similar right of the City of Duluth. It is said that this is so not only on general principles but is binding on the plaintiff by its assent to the statute, which, it is said, constituted a contract and amounted to an acceptance of the statutory proceedings as the only mode of relief.\n The Supreme Court of the State has declared the proceedings in Court to be judicial not legislative in their nature, and therefore consistent with the constitution of the State, Duluth v. Railroad & Warehouse Commission, 167 Minn. 311, 209 N. W. 10. See Janvrin, Pet'r, 174 Mass. 514, 55 N. E. 381, 47 L. R. A. 319. If \n\n[273 U.S. 625, 628]\n\u00a0\n then the State Court should affirm the rate fixed by the Commission and the matter should become res judicata, a resort to the federal Court would be too late. But the plaintiff if it prefers to entrust the final decision to the Courts of the United States rather than to those of the State has a right to do so. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 391\n, 14 S. Ct. 1047; Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 U.S. 210\n, 228, and cases cited, 29 S. Ct. 67. It might be said that this Court would have to exercise its own judgment as to how the proceedings in the State Court should be characterized and not impossibly might regard them as legislative. Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n, 43 S. Ct. 445. Or again it might be said that however characterized the judgment does not operate as such, but is taken up into the subsequent order of the Commission and therefore is subject to review after has been given that form. But as against these considerations it must be remembered that the requirement that state remedies be exhausted is not a fundamental principle of substantive law but merely a requirement of convenience or comity. Where as here a constitutional right is insisted on, we think it would be unjust to put the plaintiff to the chances of possibly reaching the desired result by an appeal to the State Court when at least it is possible that as we have said it would find itself too late if it afterwards went to the District Court of the United States. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196\n, 44 S. Ct. 553; Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S. Ct. 353.\n The argument that the plaintiff is barred by contract needs but a word. We will assume for the purposes of decision that the plaintiff by coming in under the State law made a contract, and as part of it adopted the statutory method of getting its rates changed. But it would be extravagant to say that it did more than adopt that method in its general character and with its ordinary incidents. If apart from the supposed contract a party \n\n[273 U.S. 625, 629]\n\u00a0\n would have been entitled to go to the Court of the United States at the stage when the plaintiff went there, no reasonable interpretation of the contract forbad the plaintiff to go, and there is no need to consider whether the contract could have forbidden it if it had tried.\n Finally as to the rights of the appellants. It is said that the appeal of the City is cut off by the course the plaintiff has taken. But of course the City would not appeal except on the ground that the plaintiff already was given too favorable terms. The City is in the present case and when as here the plaintiff succeeds in showing that these terms are inadequate on constitutional grounds, the City has had its day and has failed, and the loss of its appeal is merely a consequence of a trial in which it has been heard and has lost.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in this case. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRHEA v. SMITH(1927)\nNo. 199\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 434, 435]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas Hackney, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. R. Robertson, of Joplin, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity of a lien of a judgment of the federal District Court of the Western District of Missouri sitting at Joplin, upon land of the judgment debtor in Jasper county, in that district, of which Joplin is the county seat. It turns on the question whether the law of Missouri, providing for the registration, recording, docketing, and indexing of judgments of the United States district courts for the purpose of making them liens upon land in that state, conforms to the provisions of the state law upon the same subject in refer- \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 436]\n\u00a0\n ence to liens of judgments of the courts of record of the state. If it does, the lien and the title of the petitioner fail, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri must be affirmed. If not, then the case must be reversed.\n The suit herein was brought in Jasper county by William A. Rhea, in one count to determine title to certain real estate in that county, and in another by ejectment to recover its possession. There was a judgment for the defendant in the trial court, and he appealed. The facts were as follows:\n Blanche H. Whitlock was the common source of title of the plaintiff and the defendant, and in 1921, owned the property in dispute. As plaintiff, she had brought a suit in the United States District Court for the Southern Division of the Western District of Missouri at Joplin, in Jasper county. On January 10, 1921, the suit was dismissed and the costs of the case were adjudged against her in the sum of $8,890.20. On April 5, 1921, she conveyed the property in dispute to the defendant, Thomas C. Smith, for a consideration of $5,000. On July 22, 1921, execution was issued upon the judgment in the federal court, and under it the marshal sold part of the land and conveyed it by his deed to the plaintiff, Rhea, for $200. In December, 1921, another execution was issued, under which the marshal sold and conveyed to Rhea the remainder of the land in dispute for $ 25. The contention of Rhea is that the judgment of the federal court is a lien on the real estate from its rendition, that he acquired title to the fee through the execution sales, and that it was superior to any title acquired by subsequent conveyance of the judgment debtor. Smith, the respondent, contended that, in the absence of a transcript of the judgment of the federal court filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of Jasper county, as required by the Missouri law, the judgment was not a lien, and the conveyance to Smith, the respondent, by the \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 437]\n\u00a0\n judgment debtor, was free from its incumbrance. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri, and heard by the Second Division. One of the judges having been absent and the two judges constituting the division differing in opinion, the case was heard en banc, and a majority of the court affirmed the judgment below, two of the judges dissenting.\n In Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 21, 22 (6 L. Ed. 253), this court said, through Chief Justice Marshall, referring to the effect of the last clause of section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution, authorizing Congress to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution powers vested in any department of the government:\n'That a power to make laws for carrying into execution all the judgments which the judicial department has power to pronounce, is expressly conferred by this clause, seems to be one of those plan propositions which reasoning cannot render plainer. The terms of the clause neither require nor admit of elucidation. The court therefore will only say that no doubt whatever is entertained on the power of Congress over the subject.'\n\n By section 3 of the Process Act of May 19, 1828, c. 68, 4 Stat. 278, 281, writs of execution and other final process issued on judgments and decrees, rendered in any of the courts of the United States, were to be the same as those used in the courts of the state, provided, that it should be in the power of the courts, if they saw fit in their discretion, by rules of court, so far to alter final process in said courts as to conform the same to any change which might be adopted by the Legislatures of the respective states for the state courts.\n The effect of this statute was considered in Massingill v. Downs, 7 How. 760, in which the question was of the validity of a lien of a judgment obtained in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Mississippi in 1839. In 1841 the state of Mississippi had passed a \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 438]\n\u00a0\n law requiring judgments to be recorded in a particular way in order to make them a lien upon property. It was held that the statute did not abrogate the lien which had been acquired under the judgment of 1839, although the latter had not been recorded in the manner required by the state. Mr. Justice McLean, speaking for the court, said:\n'In those states where the judgment on the execution of a state court creates a lien only within the county in which the judgment is entered, it has not been doubted that a similar proceeding in the Circuit Court of the United States would create a lien to the extent of its jurisdiction. This has been the practical construction of the power of the courts of the United States, whether the lien was held to be created by the issuing of process or by express statute. Any other construction would materially affect, and in some degree subvert, the judicial power of the Union. It would place suitors in the state courts in a much better condition than in the federal courts.'\n\n It was held, therefore, in that case, that the plaintiffs in the judgment had acquired a right under the authority of the United States, and that that right could not be affected by subsequent act of the state. This principle was affirmed in Brown v. Pierce, 7 Wall. 217, and Williams v. Benedict, 8 How. 107\n\n\n Such was the state of the law until the passage of the Act of August 1, 1888, c. 729, 25 Stat. 357, which was the first formal act to regulate fully the liens of judgments and decrees of the courts of the United States. The whole act was as follows:\n'An act to regulate the liens of judgments and decrees of the courts of the United States.\n\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that judgments and decrees rendered in a circuit \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 439]\n\u00a0\n or district court of the United States within any state, shall be liens on properly throughout such state in the same manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions only as if such judgments and decrees had been rendered by a court of general jurisdiction of such state: Provided, that whenever the laws of any state require a judgment or decree of a state court to be registered, recorded, docketed, indexed, or any other thing to be done, in a particular manner, or in a certain office or county, or parish in the state of Louisiana, before a lien shall attach, this act shall be applicable therein whenever and only whenever the laws of such state shall authorize the judgments and decrees of the United States courts to be registered, recorded, docketed, indexed, or otherwise conformed to the rules and requirements relating to the judgments and decrees of the courts of the state.\n\n'Sec. 2. That the clerks of the several courts of the United States shall prepare and keep in their respective offices complete and convenient indices and cross-indices of the judgment records of said courts, and such indices and records shall at all times be open to the inspection and examination of the public.\n\n'Sec. 3. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the docketing of a judgment or decree of a United States court, or the filing of a transcript thereof, in any state office within the same county or parish in the state of Louisiana in which the judgment or decree is rendered, in order that such judgment or decree may be a lien on any property within such county.'\n\n The third section was amended by the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 180, 28 Stat. 813, to read as follows:\n'Nothing herein shall be construed to require the docketing of a judgment or decree of a United States court, or the filing of a transcript thereof, in any state office within the same county or the same parish in the state of Louisiana in which the judgment or decree is rendered, \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 440]\n\u00a0\n in order that such judgment or decree may be a lien on any property within such county, if the clerk of the United States court be required by law to have a permanent office and a judgment record open at all times for public inspection in such county or parish.'\n\n By the Act of August 23, 1916, the amending act of 1895 was repealed, 39 Stat. 531, c. 397.\n The legislation of Missouri (Rev. St. Mo. 1919), adopted in an effort to comply with the requirement of section 1 of the Congressional act of 1888, was as follows:\n'Sec. 1554. Lien of Judgment in Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals and Federal Courts in This State.-Judgments and decrees obtained in the Supreme Court, in any United States District or Circuit Court held within this state, in the Kansas City Court of Appeals or the St. Louis Court of Appeals, shall, upon the filing of a transcript thereof in the office of the clerk of any circuit court, be a lien on the real estate of the person against whom such judgment or decree is rendered, situate in the county in which such transcript is filed.\n\n'Sec. 1555. Lien in Courts of Record, Generally.-Judgments and decrees rendered by any court of record shall be a lien on the real astate of the person against whom they are rendered, situate in the county for which the court is held.\n\n'Sec. 1556. The Commencement, Extent and Duration of Lien.-The lien of a judgment or decree shall extend as well to the real estate acquired after the rendition thereof as to that which was owned when the judgment or decree was rendered. Such liens shall commence on the day of the rendition of the judgment, and shall continue for three years, subject to be revived as hereinafter provided; but when two or more judgments or decrees are rendered at the same term, as between the parties entitled to such judgments or decrees, the lien \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 441]\n\u00a0\n shall commence on the last day of the term at which they are rendered.'\n\n It is clear that Congress by the first section of the Act of August 1, 1888, quoted above, intended to change and limit the existing rule, as stated by this court, through Justice McLean, in Massingill v. Downs, supra, that federal court judgments were a lien upon lands throughout the territorial jurisdictions of the respective federal courts, but intended to do this only in those states which passed laws making the conditions of creation, scope, and territorial application of the liens of federal court judgments the same as state court judgments, so that, where any state has not passed such laws, the rule that federal judgments are liens throughout the territorial jurisdiction of such courts must still be in force. Dartmouth Savings Bank v. Bates (C. C.) 44 F. 546; Shrew v. Jones, 2 McLean, 78, 22 Fed. Cas. 40, No. 12,818.\n The Missouri statutes prescribe that judgments rendered by any state court of record shall be a lien on the real estate of the person against whom they are rendered, situate in the county for which the court is held, and the lien shall commence on the day of the rendition of the judgment and shall continue for three years. They further provide that judgments obtained in the Supreme Court of the state, in any federal court held within the state, and in the Court of Appeals of either Kansas City or St. Louis, shall upon the filing of a transcript in the office of the clerk of any circuit court be a lien on the real estate of the person against whom such judgment or decree is rendered, situate in the county in which such transcript is filed.\n It is very clear from this recital that a lien of a judgment of the federal court upon lands in the county in which it sits, if we give effect to the state statute, cannot be a lien unless a transcript of the judgment shall be \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 442]\n\u00a0\n made and filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the state in that county; whereas no such transcript of a judgment in the state circuit court is required to create a lien for its judgment, but the lien takes effect the minute that it is entered on its record. Not only is this true with respect to the state circuit court of the county, a court of general jurisdiction, but it is also true of judgments in the county court and in the probate court of that county which are courts of record.\n The majority opinion of the state Supreme Court in this case expresses the view that the difference is of so slight a character that it ought not to be regarded as a failure to conform to the federal statute. The opinion further points out that judgments of the Supreme Court of the state and of the Courts of Appeals of St. Louis and Kansas City can only become a lien upon the real estate of a judgment defendant in a particular county upon the filing of a transcript of them in the clerk's office of the circuit court where the land lies. Thus it is said that the United States District and Circuit Courts are put on the same basis as these appellate state courts, having, like the federal District Court, a larger jurisdiction than a county.\n It is obvious, however that the district court of the United States is a court of first instance of general jurisdiction just as the circuit courts of the various counties in Missouri are courts of general jurisdiction of the first instance. The conformity required should obtain as between them, and not as between the federal court and the state appellate courts.\n We are dealing here with a question necessarily of great nicety in determining the effect and the priority of liens upon real estate, and the subject requires exactness. Merely approximate conformity with reference to such a subject-matter will not do, especially where complete conformity is entirely possible. The Supreme Court of \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 443]\n\u00a0\n Missouri in its opinion says it would take but a short time and very little trouble to transcribe a judgment of the federal court sitting in a county seat and to file it in the office of the clerk of the state circuit court in the same place on the day of its rendition and thus put it on part with the lien of any judgment of the state circuit court rendered on the same day. It may be that the transcript of the judgment, if properly filed, even if the transcribing be delayed, as in usual course it is likely to be for several days, would not prejudice the holder of a judgment in the federal court, because its lien would date from its rendition in the federal court. The risk to be run, however, is in the danger that the agent or attorney of a judgment creditor in the federal court may forget to have the judgment transcribed and filed in the clerk's office of the circuit court of the county. Such forgetfulness by those changed with the duty is a factor to be considered, and makes a real difference between the provision for the lien of the federal court judgment and the instant attaching a lien upon the entry of the state court judgment without further action.\n Reference is made by the state Supreme Court to In re Jackson Light & Traction Co., 269 F. 223, a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit concerning a judgment rendered in Mississippi holding that the required conformity was furnished by the state statute. The statute required the enrollment of a judgment in the state court of general jurisdiction in order that it might become a lien upon the property in the county of its jurisdiction, only if enrolled 20 days after the term of entry of the judgment. The judgments of the federal court, the state Supreme Court and the chancery courts also became liens from the time they were enrolled in the county where the land lay. We think that case may well be distinguished from this one because necessity of enrollment was exacted as to every court. \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 444]\n\u00a0\n The majority opinion of the Supreme Court of Missouri further dwells upon a significance thought to attach to the purpose of Congress in repealing section 3 of the statute of 1888 as amended by the statute of 1895. That section thus amended specifically forbade any state statute seeking conformity to require the docketing of a judgment or decree of a federal court, or the filing of a transcript thereof in any state office within the same county in which the federal judgment or decree was rendered, in order to be a lien on the property in that county, if the clerk of the federal court had a permanent office and a judgment record open at all times for public inspection in such county. It is said that the repeal of that section indicates Congress' intention to permit the requirement in the state statute that there should be some additional record in the state court in the county where the federal court sits of the federal judgment without destroying the required conformity. Even if this be conceded, it does not show that in order to secure conformity there must not be a similar requirement for a formal record in the state court of the county of its judgment to create a lien. It is the inequality which permits a lien instantly to attach to the rendition of the judgment without more in the state court, which does not so attach in the federal court in that same county, that prevents compliance with the requirement of section 1 of the act of 1888. In the Mississippi case, above referred to, there was the same formality of enrollment within 20 days after the judgment in order to secure a lien in both the state court and the federal court in the county where both sat.\n We think that the three sections, 1555, 1556 and 1554, do not secure the needed conformity in the creation, extent and operation of the resulting liens upon land as between federal and state court judgments. The lien of federal court judgments in Missouri therefore attaches to \n\n[274 U.S. 434, 445]\n\u00a0\n all lands of the judgment debtor lying in the counties within the respective jurisdictions of the two federal District Courts in that state. This requires a reversal in this case of judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri. The cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROAD IMPROVEMENT DIST. NO. 1 v. MISSOURI PAC. R. CO.(1927)\nNo. 38\nArgued: April 19, 1926Decided: April 18, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 188, 189]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Dave Partain, of Van Buren, Ark., and Heartsell Ragon, of Clarksville, Ark., for appellants.\n Messrs. Thomas B. Pryor, of Ft. Smith, Ark., and Edward J. White, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to annul an assessment of benefits accruing to a railroad from the improvement of a public road in Franklin county, Ark. \n\n[274 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n The improvement was undertaken by a road district created for the purpose by an act of the state Legislature directing that the cost be distributed over the lands, railroads and other real property within the district in the form of special taxes measured by benefits received. Act 588, Special Road Acts 1919. The benefits were to be assessed by the district's assessors; and any owner aggrieved by their action was to have a right for twenty days to sue in a court of competent jurisdiction to set aside the assessment against his property. Otherwise it was to be 'incontestable, either at law or in equity.'\n The assessors originally assessed the benefits to the railroad at $54, 062, and the railroad company in due time brought this suit to annul that assessment-on the grounds, among others, that it was plainly arbitrary and unreasonably discriminatory and therefore in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n While the suit was pending the state Legislature confirmed the assessments, specifically including that against the railroad, and authorized additional assessments, to be made conformably to the first act, to meet the cost of proposed changes in the width of the roadbed and in other features of the improvement. Act 626, Special Acts 1921. The proposed changes in the plans were made and additional assessments ensued. In this way the total assessment against the railroad came to be $75,686. The Legislature passed an act confirming and approving the additional assessments, again specifically including that against the railroad. Act 109, Special Acts 1923. In supplementary bills, filed by the court's leave, the plaintiff set forth the additional assessment and the legislative confirmations, and challenged their validity on the same grounds that were advanced against the original assessment. \n\n[274 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n On the hearing much evidence was produced; and the District Court found that the assessment against the railroad was plainly arbitrary and unreasonably discriminatory, and on that ground entered a decree setting it aside and enjoining the defendants from attempting to collect any tax based thereon. The Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in the finding and affirmed the decree 2 F. (2d) 340.\n The defendants bring the case here, their contentions being (a) that the legislative confirmation of the assessment is controlling; (b) that the court below erred in finding that the assessment was plainly arbitrary and unreasonably discriminatory; and (c) that, if the assessment was excessive, either in itself or when compared with the assessments against other property, it should be not wholly set aside but reduced to the extent of the excess.\n There can be no doubt that the legislative confirmation placed the assessment on the same plane as if it were made by the Legislature, and thereby cured any mere irregularities on the part of the assessors; but, as the Legislature could not put aside or override constitutional limitations, the confirmation did not prevent inquiry into the alleged violation of such limitations.\n If, as found by the courts below, the assessment was plainly arbitrary and unreasonably discriminatory, it was in violation of both the due process and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; so we turn to the complaint of that finding. As the courts below concurred in the finding on successive examinations of the evidence it should be accepted by us unless shown to be clearly erroneous. Washington Securities Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 34 S. Ct. 725; Baker v. Schofield, \n243 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 37 S. Ct. 333; United States v. State Investment Co., \n264 \nU.S. 206, 211\n, 44 S. Ct. 289; Norton v. Larney, \n266 \nU.S. 511, 518\n, 45 S. Ct. 145.\n The road district extends across Franklin county from east to west along the Arkansas river and is five or six \n\n[274 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n miles wide. The public road which is being improved traverses the district from east to west, is 24 miles long, practically parallels the railroad and touches the same towns. The improvement consists in reducing curves and grades, widening the roadbed and giving it a rock base and hard surface adapted to use at all seasons by all kinds of vehicles, whether drawn by animals or propelled by motors. The road is intended to be part of a projected hardsurface highway extending from Little Rock to Ft. Smith, as the railroad does. The area of the road district is 67,000 acres and that of the railroad right of way therein is 565 acres, or eight-tenths of 1 per cent. of the whole. The benefits assessed to property in the district aggregate $575,421.35, of which $75,686, or 13.2 per cent., is assessed to the railroad.\n The assessment to the railroad is not based on real property alone, but also on rolling stock and other personalty valued at $52,465, while all other assessments are confined to real property. In this there is an obvious and unreasonable discrimination. Further discrimination is said to be shown by testimony indicating that the assessors fixed the benefits to the railroad on a mileage basis regardless of area, and as to other property proceeded solely with regard to area. But this testimony must be put aside by reason of the legislative adoption of the assessments. The modes in which the assessors arrived at the amounts assessed were not shown on the assessment roll or communicated to the Legislature; so the question of discrimination must be determined independently of the theories and processes of the assessors, as if the assessments were made directly by the Legislature.\n Most of the testimony is addressed to the questions whether and how far the railroad will be benefited by the intended improvement of the parallel public road. Some witnesses are of opinion there will be no benefit, and a \n\n[274 U.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n few that there will be great benefit. These are extreme views, and are weakened, rather than supported, by further statements of the same witnesses. Other testimony in substantial volume, coming from witnesses informed by observation and experience, is to the effect that, while an increase in particular traffic with accompanying revenue reasonably may be expected, it will be less than would be realized if the highway extended away from the railroad and reached localities theretofore without such a road; that, unlike such a lateral feeder, the parallel road reaching the same towns as the railroad will through its ready use by motor-driven vehicles withdraw from the railroad much of the less than carload freight between these towns, and much of the passenger traffic between them; that such has been the actual result in similar situations along this and other railroads in Arkansas and other states, specific instances being described; and that the loss to this railroad in the instances described has ranged from 50 to 90 per cent. of such local traffic and compelled a cessation of part of the service to which it was incident. The successful competition of motor trucks in these situations is explained on the grounds that they do not bear the cost of constructing and maintaining the roadway, and are able to receive and deliver freight at the street door and to relieve their patrons from drayage charges. The view that the improved road will be of mixed benefit and detriment to the railroad is not confined to the plaintiff's witnesses but shared by informed witnesses called by the defendants. One of these, a mamber of the state highway commission and familiar with the particular situation and the development in the locality, testifies:\n'Q. What in your opinion is the effect of building this highway upon the revenue of the Missouri Pacific Railway? Will it be a detriment to it, or will it not be a benefit? A. Well, from some standpoints a bene- \n\n[274 U.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n fit, and from others perhaps a detriment, but as a whole perhaps a benefit.'\n\n From all the testimony we think there is ample ground for believing that the improved road will lead to an increase in the traffic and revenue of the railroad, as respects freight moving in carload lots and passengers traveling considerable distances, but that the benefit from this will be cut down by a substantial loss in local freight and passenger traffic attracted to motordriven vehicles moving over the improved road. That such a loss in local traffic usually ensues when hard-surface roads adapted to use by motor-driven vehicles are constructed practically parallel to railroads is not only shown by the testimony, but is common knowledge. It received distinct recognition in the President's message of December 8, 1922, to Congress.\n We think it also appears from the testimony that the increase in revenue reasonably to be expected will be greater than the loss, but that the excess will not be such as to justify an assessment of benefits of $75, 686, or more than a small fraction of that sum. Indeed, on the present showing, we should regard an assessment in excess of $15,000 as passing the outside limit of reasonable judgment and plainly arbitrary.\n Our conclusion is that the assessment against the railroad is unreasonably discriminatory in so far as it is based on personal property, and in this respect violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it is otherwise so excessive as to be a manifestly arbitrary exaction and in violation of the due process of law clause of the same amendment. In these respects the finding and holding below are well grounded.\n It follows that the present assessment is invalid and an injunction should be granted against its enforcement. The District Court so decreed. But as, on the present showing, it appears that an assessment of some benefits- \n\n[274 U.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n in an amount certainly below $15,00-would be justified, the way should be left open for making a new or revised assessment. The defendants ask, if the present assessment be held excessive, that it be reduced in this suit to a proper sum. But to this we do not assent. The state statute commits the assessing of benefits to a special nonjudicial board of assessors, and authorizes that board, when requested by the commissioners of the district, to revise their assessments by 'increasing or diminishing the assessment against particular pieces of property as justice requires.' Act 588,  11, Special Road Acts 1919. The better course is to leave the making of a substituted or revised assessment to that board. The decree will be modified by including a provision that it is without prejudice to a lawful revision of the assessment conformably to the state statute and not exceeding $15,000 in amount.\n Decree modified, and affirmed, as modified. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROBINS DRY DOCK & REPAIR CO. v.

Hupper, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 303, 307]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel by time charterers of the steamship Bjornefjord against the Dry Dock Company to recover for the loss of use of the steamer between August 1 and August 15, 1917. The libelants recovered in both Courts below. 13 F. (2d) 3. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n273 \nU.S. 679\n, 47 S. Ct. 108.\n By the terms of the charter party the steamer was to be docked at least once in every six months, and payment of the hire was to be suspended until she was again in proper state for service. In accordance with these terms the vessel was delivered to the petitioner and docked, and while there the propeller was so injured by the petitioner's negligence that a new one had to be put in, thus causing the delay for which this suit is brought. The petitioner seems to have had no notice of the charter party until the delay had begun, but on August 10, 1917, was formally advised by the respondents that they should hold it liable. It settled with the owners on December 7, 1917, and received a release of all their claims.\n The present libel 'in a cause of contract and damage' seems to have been brought in reliance upon allegation that the contract for dry docking between the petitioner and the owners 'was made for the benefit of the libelants and was incidental to the aforesaid charter party,' etc. But it is plain, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the libelants, respondents here, were not parties to that contract 'or in any respect beneficiaries' and were not entitled to sue for a breach of it 'even under the most liberal rules that permit third parties to sue on a contract made for their benefit.' 13 F. (2d) 4. 'Before a stranger can avail himself of the exceptional privilege of suing for a breach of an agreement, to which he is not a party, he must, at least, show that it was intended for his direct benefit.'

Although the respondents still somewhat faintly argue the contrary this question seems to us to need no more words. But as the case has been discussed here and below without much regard to the pleadings we proceed to consider the other grounds upon which it has been thought that a recovery could be maintained.\n The District Court allowed recovery on the ground that the respondents had a 'property right' in the vessel, although it is not argued that there was a demise, and the owners remained in possession. This notion also is repudiated by the Circuit Court of Appeals and rightly. The question is whether the respondents have an interest protected by the law against unintended injuries inflicted upon the vessel by third persons who know nothing of the charter. If they have, it must be worked out through their contract relations with the owners, not on the postulate that they have a right in rem against the ship. Leary v. United States, 14 Wall. 607; New Orleans-Belize Royal Mail & Central American Steamship Co. v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 202\n, 36 S. Ct. 76.\n Of course the contract of the petitioner with the owners imposed no immediate obligation upon the petitioner to third persons as we already have said, and whether the petitioner performed it promptly or with negligent delay was the business of the owners and of nobody else. But as there was a tortious damage to a chattel it is sought to connect the claim of the respondents with that in some way. The damage was material to them only as it caused the delay in making the repairs, and that delay would be a wrong to no one except for the petioner's contract with the owners. The injury to the propeller was no wrong to the respondents but only to those to whom it belonged. But suppose that the respondent's loss flowed directly from that source. Their loss arose only through their contract with the owners-and while intentionally to \n\n[275 U.S. 303, 309]\n\u00a0\n bring about a breach of contract may give rise to a cause of action. Angle v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Ry. Co., \n151 \nU.S. 1\n, 14 S. Ct. 240, no authority need be cited to show that, as a general rule, at least, a tort to the person or property of one man does not make the tort-feasor liable to another merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other unknown to the doer of the wrong. See National Savings Bank v. Ward, \n100 U.S. 195\n. The law does not spread its protection so far. A good statement, applicable here, will be found in Elliott Steam Tug Co., Ltd., v. The Shipping Controller, (1922) 1 K. B. 127, 139, 140; Byrd v. English, 117 Ga. 192, 43 S. E. 419, 64 L. R. A. 94; The Federal No. 2 (C. C. A.) 21 F. (2d) 313.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have been influenced by the consideration that if the whole loss occasioned by keeping a vessel out of use were recovered and divided a part would go to the respondents. It seems to have been thought that perhaps the whole might have been recovered by the owners, that in that event the owners would have been trustees for the respondents to the extent of the respondents' share, and that no injustice would be done to allow the respondents to recover their share by direct suit. But justice does not permit that the petitioner be charged with the full value of the loss of use unless there is some one who has a claim to it as against the petitioner. The respondents have no claim either in contract or in tort, and they cannot get a standing by the suggestion that if some one else had recovered it he would have been bound to pay over a part by reason of his personal relations with the respondents. The whole notion of such a recovery is based on the supposed analogy of bailees who if allowed to recover the whole are chargeable over, on what has been thought to be a misunderstanding of the old law that the bailees alone could sue for a conversion and were answerable over for the chattel to their bailor. Whether this view be historically correct or not there is no analogy to \n\n[275 U.S. 303, 310]\n\u00a0\n the present case when the owner recovers upon a contract for damage and delay.

SALZ(1927)\nNo. 51\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Messrs. L. T. Hengstler and H. H. Sanborn, both of San Francisco, Cal. (Mr. Frederick W. Dorr, of San Francisco, Cal., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Carroll Single, of San Francisco, Cal. (Mr. S. Hasket Derby, of San Francisco, Cal., of counsel), for respondent. \n\n[273 U.S. 326, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal involves the construction and application of section 3 of the Harter Act, 27 Stat. 445, c. 105 (Comp. St.  8031), which, so far as pertinent here, provides:\n'That if the owner of any vessel transporting merchandise or property to or from any port in the United States of America shall exercise due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied, neither the vessel, her owner or owners, agent, or charterers, shall become or be held responsible for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of said vessel. ...'\n\n Petitioner is a common carrier on the Sacramento river in California, and owns and operates the barge Tennessee, which is not equipped with motive power, and the steamer San Joaquin No. 4. On September 23, 1921, petitioner received from respondent for transportation a quantity of barley in sacks. The bill of lading acknowledges shipment of the barley 'on board of the Sacramento Transportation (Navigation) Co.'s barge Tennessee, ... with the privilege of reshipping in whole or in part, on steamboats or barges; also with the privilege of towing with one steamer, at the same time, ... two or more barges, either loaded or empty.' While being towed by the steamer in the course of transportation, the barge came into collision with a British ship at anchor and was swamped. The barley was a total loss. The sole cause of the collision was the negligence of the steamer. That both barge and steamer were 'in all respects seaworthy, and properly manned, equipped, and supplied,' is not in dispute. Upon these facts, respondent filed its libel in personam against petitioner.\n In the view we take of the case the sole question to be determined is whether the barge alone, or the combina- \n\n[273 U.S. 326, 328]\n\u00a0\n tion of tug and barge, was the 'vessel transporting' the barley, within the meaning of the Harter Act. This question is a nice one, and the answer to it is by no means obvious. The court below thought the contract was between the respondent and the barge, and did not include the tug; that, since the barge had no power of her own, there was an implied contract that a tug would be furnished to carry her to her destination; and that the Harter Act should receive a strict construction, and, so construed, it applied only to the relation of a vessel to the cargo with which she was herself laden-that is to say, in this case, the barge alone. The decree of the District Court for respondent, accordingly, was affirmed. 3 F. (2d) 759.\n The libel recites that it is 'in a cause of towage,' and in argument this is strenuously insisted upon. Towage service is the employment of one vessel to expedite the voyage of another. Here, while there was towage service, the contract actually made with respondent was not to tow a vessel, but to transport goods, and plainly that contract was a contract of affreightment. See Bramble v. Culmer (C. C. A.) 78 F. 497, 501; The Nettie Quill (D. C.) 124 F. 667, 670. Respondent's contention, however, seems to be that the shipping contract as evidenced by the bill of lading was with or for the barge alone, but that, when petitioner took the barge in tow, an implied contract of towage with respondent at once arose. This view of the matter, we think, is fallacious.\n The fact that we are dealing with vessels, which by a fiction of the law are invested with personality, does not require us to disregard the actualities of the situation, namely, that the owner of the tug towed his own barge as a necessary incident of the contract of affreightment, and that the transportation of the cargo was in fact effected by their joint operation. The bill of lading declares that the cargo was shipped on board the barge. \n\n[273 U.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n But it was to be transported, and this the barge alone was incapable of doing, since she had no power of self-movement. If results, necessarily, that it was within the contemplation of the contract that the transportation would be accomplished by combining the barge with a vessel having such power. Respondent says there was an implied contract to this effect; that is, as we understand, a distinct contract implied in fact. But a contract includes, not only the promises set forth in express words, but, in addition, all such implied provisions as are indispensable to effectuate the intention of the parties and as arise from the language of the contract and the circumstances under which it was made. 3 Williston on Contracts,  1293; Brodie v. Cardiff Corporation (1919) A. C. 337, 358. And there is no justification here for going beyond the contract actually made to invoke the conception of an independent implied contract.\n Considering the language of the bill of lading in the light of all the circumstances, it is manifest that we are dealing with a single contract, and the use of the tug must be read into that contract as an indispensable factor in the performance of its obligations. To transport means to convey or carry from one place to another; and a transportation contract for the barge without the tug would have been as futile as a contract for the use of a freight car without a locomotive. In this view, by the terms of the contract of affreightment, in part expressed and in part necessarily resulting from that which was expressed, the transportation of the goods was called for, not by the barge, an inert thing, but by the barge and tug, constituting together the effective instrumentality to that end.\n It is said that the Harter Act is to be strictly construed. The Main v. Williams, \n152 \nU.S. 122, 132\n, 14 S. Ct. 486. Even so, the rule of strict construction is not violated by permitting the words of a statute to have their full meaning, or the more \n\n[273 U.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n extended of two meanings. The words are not to be bent one way or the other, but to be taken in the sense which will best manifest the legislative intent. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396; United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 242\n, 30 S. Ct. 81. In the light of the decisions presently to be noted, the words a 'vessel transporting merchandise,' etc., are entirely appropriate to describe the combination now in question, and we see no reason to think that Congress intended that they should not be so applied. This court and other federal courts repeatedly have held that such a combination constitutes, in law, one vessel. See The Northern Belle, 9 Wall. 526, 528, 529; The Civilta and the Restless, \n103 U.S. 699\n, 701; The Nettie Quill, supra; The Columbia (C. C. A.) 73 F. 226; The Seven Bells (C. C. A.) 241 F. 43, 45; The Fred W. Chase (D. C.) 31 F. 91, 95; The Bordentown (D. C.) 40 F. 682, 687; State v. Turner, 34 Or. 173, 175, 176, 55 P. 92, 56 P. 645.\n In the Northern Belle, supra, this court, speaking of a combination of barge and steamboat, said that 'the barge is considered as belonging to the boat to which she is attached for the purposes of that voyage.' In The Civilta and the Restless, supra, a tug and a ship which she was towing by means of a hawser were held to be in contemplation of law 'one vessel, and that a vessel under steam.'\n In The Columbia, supra, it was held that a barge having no motive power and a tug belonging to the same owner and furnishing the motive power constituted one vessel for the purposes of the voyage. In that case, wheat was to be transported by means of the barge, and the owner of the barge and tug undertook the transportation. The court said (page 237):\n'As the wheat was to be carried on board the barge, which had no motive power, of necessity such power had to be supplied by the carrier. ... When the tug made fast and took in tow the barge, to perform the contract of carriage, the two became one \n\n[273 U.S. 326, 331]\n\u00a0\n vessel for the purpose of that voyage-as much so as if she had been taken bodily on board the tug, instead of being made fast thereto by means of lines.'\n\n It was accordingly held that, without surrendering both vessels, the owner was not entitled to the advantages of Revised Statutes,  4283 et seq. (Comp. St.  8021 et seq.), providing for a limitation of liability of 'the owner of any vessel,' etc.\n The court below rejected this decision as not applicable to a case arising under the Harter Act; but it is hard to see why the case is not pertinent, and, if sound, controlling. What we are called upon to ascertain is the meaning of the term 'any vessel,' and the point decided in that case is that it includes a combination identical in all respects with that here dealt with. True, the court there, in construing the phrase 'the owner of any vessel,' was considering one statute, while here we are considering another and different statute; but there is no such difference between the statutes in respect of the connection in which the phrase is used, or in respect of the subject-matter to which it relates, as to suggest that Congress intended that it should bear different meanings.\n Respondent contends that his view to the contrary is sustained by The Murrel (C. C. A.) 195 F. 483, affirming (D. C.) 200 F. 826, and The Coastwise (C. C. A.) 233 F. 1, affirming (D. C.) 230 F. 505. Some things are said in those cases which, if we should not consider the differences between them and the present case, might justify this contention. The most important of these differences is that in both cases it was held that contracts of towage and not of affreightment were involved. We do not stop to inquire whether this conclusion as to the nature of the contracts was justified by the facts. It is enough that it was so held, and this holding was the basis of the decisions. Here, upon all the facts, as we have just said, the contract upon which respondent must rest is one of affreightment, the obligation of which is to carry a cargo, not to tow a vessel. \n\n[273 U.S. 326, 332]\n\u00a0\n Liverpool, etc., Nav. Co. v. Brooklyn Terminal, \n251 \nU.S. 48\n, 40 S. Ct. 66, also relied upon by respondent, is not to the contrary. There the libel was for a collision with petitioner's steamship, the moving cause of which was respondent's steam tug, proceeding up the East River, with a loaded car float lashed to one side and a disabled tug to the other, all belonging to respondent. The car float came into contact with the steamship; but the court said it was a passive instrument in the hands of the tug and did not affect the question of responsibility. The controversy arose upon a claim to limit liability, petitioner contending that the entire flotilla should have been surrendered. This court held that it was necessary to surrender only the active tug, saying 'that for the purposes of liability the passive instrument of the harm does not become one with the actively responsible vessel by being attached to it.' But this is far from saying that the entire flotilla might not be regarded as one vessel for the purposes of the undertaking in which the common owner was engaged at the time of the collision. The distinction seems plain. There the libel was for an injury to a ship in no way related to the flotilla. It was a pure tort; no contractual obligations were involved; and the simple inquiry was, What constituted the 'offending vessel'? Here we must ask, What constituted the vessel by which the contract of transportation was to be effected? a very different question. It the British ship, which here was struck by the barge, were suing to recover damages, and a limitation of liability were sought by the owner of the tug and barge, the Liverpool Case would be in point. But the present libel is for a loss of cargo, and falls within the principle of The Columbia, supra, where, upon facts substantially identical with those here, a surrender was required of the combined means by which the company undertook the transportation of the cargo.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEEMAN v. PHILADELPHIA WAREHOUSE CO.(1927)\nNo. 198\nArgued: March 8, 1927Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 403, 404]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel F. Frank, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Owen J. Roberts, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought suit in the District Court for Southern New York to recover for the conversion of a quantity of canned salmon pledged to it as security for a loan. The pledgor, who had fraudulently regained possession, sold the salmon to petitioners. The defense set up was that the transaction between respondent and the pledgor was usurious, and therefore void under the law of New York, where the pledgor conducted its business, and where petitioners contend the pledge agreement was made.\n The trial court charged the jury that the New York law was applicable. The jury returned a verdict for petitioners. The judgment on the verdict was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Philadelphia Warehouse Co. v. Seeman, 7 F.(2d) 999. This court granted certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 543\n, 46 S. Ct. 26.\n Respondent is a Pennsylvania corporation, having its only office or place of business in Philadelphia. It has an established credit, and for many years has engaged in a business which is carried on according to the routine followed in the present case, which, respondent contends, results in loans of credit, and not of money. To applicants in need of funds it delivers its promissory note, payable to its own order and then indorsed. The applicant in exchange gives the required security-here ware- \n\n[274 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n house receipts for the salmon-and a pledge agreement by which he undertakes to pay the amount of the note at maturity to respondent at its office in Philadelphia, and agrees that the collateral pledged shall be security for all obligations present and prospective. At the same time the applicant pays to respondent a 'commission' for its 'services' and for the 'advance of its credit,' computed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on the face of the note. He is then free to discount the note and to use the proceeds. In practice, as in the present case, respondent usually, with the consent of the borrower, delivers the note to its own note broker in Philadelphia, receives from him the proceeds of the note, less discount and brokerage, and pays or forwards the amount so received to the borrower. At maturity he must pay the face value of the note to respondent, or, as was the case here, renew the note by paying a new commission and the amount of the discount on the matured note. On each transaction the applicant thus pays, in addition to the amount of the proceeds of the note, the commission and the discount. Respondent, after taking up its note, retains the commission alone as the net compensation for its part in the transaction. In addition, the applicant may, as was the case here, pay the fees of the note broker and the fee or compensation of a loan broker, acting as intermediary in securing the accommodation by respondent, a total amount far exceeding 6 per cent., the legal rate of interest in New York. The commission and discount paid here varied from 8 1\/2 to 10 1\/2 per cent. per annum of the face amount of the notes, taking no account of fees paid to brokers.\n In Pennsylvania, the exaction of interest on loans of money in excess of 6 per cent., the lawful rate, does not invalidate the entire transaction, but excess interest may be recovered by the borrower. Penn. Stat. 1920,  12491, 12492; Montague v. McDowell, 99 Pa. 265, 269; Stay- \n\n[274 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n ton v. Riddle, 114 Pa. 464, 469, 7 A. 72; Marr v. Marr, 110 Pa. 60, 20 A. 592. The business carried on by respondent as described, was considered and upheld by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as not usurious in Righter, Cowgill & Co. v. Philadelphia Warehouse Co., 99 Pa. 289.\n To avoid the application of the Pennsylvania law to the present transaction and others for which the salmon was held as security, and to bring them within the prohibition of the New York law, petitioners at the trial relied on evidence that preliminary negotiations were had in New York City between the pledgor and the agent of respondent from which it might be inferred that the agreement was in fact made there, although the formal documents were dated at Philadelphia and respondent actually executed its note and delivered it to the note broker there. Petitioners also relied on the special circumstances of the case, particularly the fact that respondent itself procured the proceeds of the note in Philadelphia and forwarded them to the borrower in New York, as ground for the inference by the jury that the real transaction was the loan of money thinly disguised as a loan or sale of credit. As the total amount paid to respondent included both the discount and the commission, aggregating more than the legal rate of interest, it is insisted that these charges, if for a loan of money, were usurious, even though respondent retained only the commission after satisfying the demands of the discounting banks.\n The court below held that there was no evidence that the transaction was other than that of its form, a loan of credit; that the agreement between the lender and the borrower was completed only when the respondent delivered its note to the broker in Philadelphia, and that the agreement must therefore be regarded as a Pennsylvania contract, valid under the law of that state; and that in \n\n[274 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n any case, as Philadelphia, by the express terms of the contract, was made the place of payment by the borrower, the legality of the transaction must be determined by the law of Pennsylvania, and not of New York.\n But, in the view we take, we think it immaterial whether the contract was entered into in New York of Pennsylvania, and it may be assumed for the purposes of our decision that the jury might have found that in fact the parties stipulated for a loan of money rather than of credit. \n1\n Respondent, a Pennsylvania corporation having its place of business in Philadelphia, could legitimately lend funds outside the state, and stipulate for repayment in Pennsylvania in accordance with its laws, and at the rate of interest there lawful, even though the agreement for the loan were entered into in another state, where a different law and a different rate of interest prevailed. In the federal courts, as was said in Andrews v. Pond, 13 Pet. 65, 77, 78 (10 L. Ed. 61):\n'The general principle in relation to contracts made in one place, to be executed in another, is well settled. They are to be governed by the law of the place of performance, and if the interest allowed by the laws of the place of performance is higher than that permitted at the place of the contract, the parties may stipulate for the higher interest, without incurring the penalties of usury.' Miller v. Tiffany, 1 Wall. 298; Bedford v. Eastern Building & Loan Association, \n181 \nU.S. 227, 242\n, 243 S., 21 S. Ct. 597.\n\n See Junction R. R. v. Bank of Ashland, 12 Wall. 226, 229; Peyton v. Heinekin, 131 U. S. Append. ci. Cf. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n96 U.S. 51\n, 62.\n In support of a policy of upholding contractual obligations assumed in good faith, this court has adopted the \n\n[274 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n converse of the rule quoted from Andrews v. Pond, supra:\n'If the rate of interest be higher at the place of the contract than at the place of performance the parties may lawfully contract in that case also for the higher rate.'\n\n See Miller v. Tiffany, supra, 310; Junction R. R. Bank of Ashland, supra, 229; Cromwell v. County of Sac, supra, 62; Wharton, Conflict of Laws,  510h. Cf. Tilden v. Blair, 21 Wall. 241; and see Cockle v. Flack, \n93 U.S. 344\n, 347.\n A qualification of these rules, as sometimes stated, is that the parties must act in good faith, and that the form of the transaction must not 'disguise its real character.' See Miller v. Tiffany, supra, 310. As thus stated, the qualification, if taken too literally, would destory the rules themselves, for they obviously are to be invoked only to save the contract from the operation of the usury laws of the one jurisdiction or the other. The effect of the qualification is merely to prevent the evasion or avoidance at will of the usury law otherwise applicable, by the parties' entering into the contract or stipulating for its performance at a place which has no normal relation to the transaction and to whose law they would not otherwise be subject. Wharton, in his Conflict of Laws, section 210o, in discussing this qualification, says:\n'Assuming that their real, bona fide intention was to fix the situs of the contract at a certain place which has a natural and vital connection with the transaction, the fact that they were actuated in so doing by an intention to obtain a higher rate of interest than is allowable by the situs of some of the other elements of the transaction does not prevent the application of the law allowing the higher rate.'\n\n See Van Vleet v. Sledge (C. C.) 45 F. 743, 752; Goodrich v. Williams, 50 Ga. 425, 435; U. S. Savings & Loan Co. v. Harris (C. C.) 113 F. 27, 32.\n Here respondent, organized and conducting its business in Pennsylvania, was subject to laws of that state, and \n\n[274 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n had a legitimate interest in seeking their benefit. The loan contract, which stipulated for repayment there, and which thus chose that law as governing its validity, cannot be condemned as an evasion of the law of New York, which might otherwise be deemed applicable.\n Petitioners rely upon the fact that in some instances, in connection with other transactions between respondent and the pledgor, payments on account of amounts due were made by deposits in respondent's account in a New York bank, although the other payments were made in Philadelphia. But we do not think this circumstance, standing alone, is sufficient to vary the application of the rule. There is no suggestion to be found in the record that in the negotiations preliminary to the signing of the contract, or at any other time, there was any agreement by the parties that payment should be made other than in accordance with the tenor of the written agreement. The pledgor never did pay the amount of the note involved in the present transaction. It was three times renewed, and on each renewal the discount on the maturing note and the commission on the renewal were either paid by the pledgor by check in Philadelphia or deducted there by his authority from the proceeds of the renewal note. The fact that in some instances wholly unexplained such payments were received elsewhere affords no basis for the contention that the written stipulation for payment in Philadelphia was not the real one, or that its obligation was waived. If the creditor might have compelled payment in the federal courts in New York (see Bedford v. Eastern Building & Loan Association, supra), he could receive payment there of a part of the debt without forfeiting the balance.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Forgotston v.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 195\nArgued: October 12, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. B. Wilcox, of San Juan, Porto Rico, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. J. Donovan, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a review of a sentence against the petitioners upon a criminal information, filed in the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico, charging in the first count possession, and in the second count transportation, of intoxicating liquors in violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). The conviction on the possession count was set aside by the Circuit Court of Appeals, so that only the second count is here involved. Upon arraignment, petitioners waived a reading of the information and pleaded not guilty. Their counsel thereupon requested that they be furnished with a copy of the information free of charge. The request was denied by the court and an exception noted, the trial court stating that the defendants and their counsel were free to examine the information and to make copies themselves, or have the clerk make them on payment of his fee.\n At the trial, Alfonso Ceballos, chief of police at Carolina, Porto Rico, testified for the prosecution that, having received a confidential telephone meassage that Segurola was driving a Buick automobile with a load of liquor from \n\n[275 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n Luquillo to Loiza, he procured one Ismael Colon to drive him in a Ford car out to a point on the road where he awaited the appearance of the Buick machine; that when that car appeared he tried to intercept it by obstructing the road with the Ford, but Segurola operated his Buick so as to force the Ford aside, by threat of a collision, and went by at high speed; that the officer was in uniform, which Segurola must have observed; that he followed in the Ford into Carolina, where, owing to obstacles encountered by the Buick, he managed to get around in front of it and, when Segurola saw his way blocked by the Ford, he stopped the Buick, put it in reverse, and crashed into an electric wire post; that Ceballos then arrested Segurola, as well as Santiago, who was sitting beside him, and that a search by Ceballos of the rear compartment of the Buick, which was a roadster, disclosed a number of sacks containing bottles of whisky, brandy, and gin.\n In the cross-examination, Ceballos was asked who gave him the information by telephone. Counsel for the government objected that 'they are the secrets of the police force, which should not be stated in a court of justice, and the stating of the source of such information would be against public policy.' The objection was sustained and an exception noted. Evidence was given of the alcoholic content of the liquor and the identity of that examined with that seized. When the liquor was offered and received in evidence, it was objected to on the ground that it had not been properly identified, but the objection was overruled and the liquor admitted. Thereafter, counsel for the defendants moved to suppress the liquor, as evidence, on the ground that the search was without a warrant and did not appear to have been made upon probable cause, and, also, for the reason that upon the issue of probable cause defendants were not permitted to cross-examine the seizing officer as to the person from whom he \n\n[275 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n received by telephone the information which induced him to go to look for the Buick car. The motion was overruled. No objection was ever made to the evidence of the officers and others that liquor was found in the car and no evidence to dispute these facts was offered by the defense. At the close of the trial the jury found the defendants guilty as charged and the court sentenced them to pay fines.\n The case was carried upon writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 16 F. (2d) 563. That court affirmed the judgment, holding that the refusal to furnish a copy of the information without payment of a fee to the clerk was right and, even if erroneous, was, under the circumstances, a harmless error; that the refusal to permit cross-examination of the officer as to his informant in respect to the coming of Segurola and the contents of his car was in accord with approved public policy and that the circumstances constituted probable cause for a legal seizure.\n The error assigned to the failure to direct the delivery of a copy of the information rests on the second section of the Organic Act of Porto Rico (Act of March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat. 951, U. S. C., Title 48,  737 (48 USCA  737, Comp. St.  3803aa)), in which it is provided that:\n'In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to have a copy thereof, to have a speedy and public trial, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.'\n\n The District Judge held that this did not mean that the defendant was to have a copy of the information without paying the regular copying fees to the clerk. We think this was an erroneous construction of the statute. It was enacted by Congress to apply in a country where there were two languages, and in which a \n\n[275 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n criminal procedure, new in some of its aspects, was to be put into effect. It was not strange, therefore, that it was thought necessary ex industria to emphasize the means by which the accused could be advised of the charge made against him. These circumstances make the case of United States v. Van Duzee, \n140 \nU.S. 169, 172\n, 11 S. Ct. 758, relied on by the Circuit Court of Appeals, inapplicable. The words do not appear in the analogous provisions of the guaranty of the rights of the accused in our Constitution. They should be given some real effect and the opportunity thus conferred to read the charge upon which the accused is brought into court should not be obstructed by the necessity for paying fees for its enjoyment. We think, therefore, that the court was wrong in not directing that a copy be furnished to each defendant. But that is very different from saying that because of the failure of the court to issue this order, the trial which ensued should be held for naught and a new trial had. As a matter of fact, the petitioners, when attended by counsel, waived a reading of the information and pleaded not guilty, which was an indication that they already knew what the information was and that they really suffered no prejudice which would justify a new trial. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals in its conclusion that in any view the error was a harmless one.\n The questions which have been chiefly argued here are, first, the correctness of the refusal of the court to allow the police officer to be cross-examined as to the name of the person who communicated to him the information that the defendants were engaged in transporting liquor in a Buick car; and, second, the question of the existence of probable cause to justify the seizure of the automobile under the circumstances shown.\n We think that these two questions do not arise, and that the judgment should be affirmed, without regard to the proper answer to them. The results of the search \n\n[275 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n and seizure were shown by the testimony of the chief of police and of the other witnesses without any objection on behalf of the defendants; and thus was disclosed the fact that the defendants had been engaged in transporting a large amount of liquor in the Buick. No motion was made to strike that evidence out, and no evidence was introduced to contradict what was disclosed by the statements of the chief of police and other witnesses upon this point. The only objection made toward the close of the evidence for the government was that, when it was proposed to introduce the liquor, it had not been properly identified, but there was ample evidence to show that it had. The motion made thereafter to suppress the liquor as evidence, on the ground that there had been an illegal search, did not include a motion to strike out the evidence of the witnesses as to what occurred when the car was stopped. The objection to the seizure was plainly an afterthought.\n As there was no evidence introduced by the defendants to refute or deny the testimony unobjected to, which clearly showed the illegal transportation of the liquor and sustained the verdict, the admission in evidence of the liquor and the refusal to permit cross-examination of Ceballos worked no prejudice for which a reversal can be granted. Moreover, the principle laid down by this Court in Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585\n, 24 S. Ct. 372, and recognized as proper in Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 395\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, and in Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192\n, 48 S. Ct. 74, No. 185, October term, 1927, decided this day, applies to render unavailing, under the circumstances of this case, the objection to the use of the liquor as evidence based on the Fourth Amendment. This principle is that, except where there has been no opportunity to present the matter in advance of trial, Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 305\n, 41 S. Ct. 261; Amos v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 313, 316\n, 41 S. Ct. 266; Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 34\n, 46 S. Ct. 4, a court, when engaged in trying a criminal case, will not take notice of \n\n[275 U.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n the manner in which witnesses have possessed themselves of papers or other articles of personal property, which are material and properly offered in evidence, because the court will not in trying a criminal cause permit a collateral issue to be raised as to the source of competent evidence. To pursue it would be to halt in the orderly progress of a cause and consider incidentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such litigation and which is wholly independent of it. In other words, in order to raise the question of illegal seizure, and an absence of probable cause in that seizure, the defendants should have moved to have the whisky and other liquor returned to them as their property and as not subject to seizure to use as evidence. To preserve their rights under the Fourth Amendment, they must at least have seasonably objected to the production of the liquor in court. This they did not do, but waited until the liquor had been offered and admitted and then for the first time raised the question of legality of seizure and probable cause as a ground for withdrawing the liquor from consideration of the jury. This was too late.\n On behalf of Santiago, the companion of Segurola in the Buick, it is urged that there was no evidence to justify his conviction and that his is a case of poor dog Tray. He accompanied Segurola from Luquillo to Carolina and in the race of cars which occurred on that trip. There were 188 bottles of liquor lying loose in eleven sacks in a box back of the seat under him in the Buick. He could hardly have been unconscious of their presence. The seizing officer said that Santiago was present and saw the liquor as seized. But Santiago testified that he didn't see the liquor and did not know why he and his companion were being taken to the station. In view of the jar of the collision of the Buick with the electric wire post and the exciting race between the cars and the contradicting evidence of the government witnesses, the jury evidently \n\n[275 U.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n thought that Santiago protested too much and had destroyed his credibility. We cannot say that there was no evidence to sustain their verdict.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHIELDS v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 944\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. E. Lowry Humes, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Solicitor General Mitchell, of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. John J. Byrne, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question here for review is the judgment of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals of February 14, 1927. \n\n[273 U.S. 583, 584]\n\u00a0\n A petition for certiorari was filed in this court February 28, 1927, and is this day granted. For reasons to be explained, we proceed at once to consider the case on its merits.\n Shields, the petitioner, was indicted and tried with eight or nine others for conspiracy to violate the Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/4 et seq.), and also for direct violations of the act. He was convicted of conspiracy and acquitted of the other charges. The case had been submitted to the jury February 12, 1926. Before the court convened the next morning, the jury still being out, counsel for the defendants and the assistant United States attorney in charge of the prosecution visited the trial judge in chambers and requested that the jury be held in deliberation until they should agree upon a verdict. Shortly after the opening of the court the jury returned for additional instructions on the subject of entrapment, and having received the same, retired for further deliberation. At 2:30 o'clock that afternoon the jury again returned to court, in the absence of petitioner and his counsel, and reported that they could not agree. What instructions, if any, were then given the jury the record does not disclose. It appears that the jury again retired to deliberate, and between 4:30 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon sent from their jury room to the judge in chambers the following written communication:\n'We, the jury, find the defendants John G. Emmerling, Charles Lynch not guilty on all counts. E. W. Hardison, J. E. Hunter, and J. L. Simler guilty on all counts. Daniel J. Shields, Harry Widman, J. M. Gastman unable to agree.\n\n'(Signed) E. B. Milligan, Foreman.'\n\n The judge from his chambers sent back the following written reply:\n'The jury will have to find also whether Shields, Widman, and Gastman are guilty or not guilty.\n\n F. P. Schoonmaker, Judge.' \n\n[273 U.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n These communications were not made in open court, and neither the petitioner Shields nor his counsel was present, nor were they advised of them. Shortly after, the jury returned in court and announced the following verdict:\n'We, the jury, find that the defendants John G. Emmerling, Charles Lynch, not guilty on all counts. E. W. Hardison, J. L. Simler, J. E. Hunter guilty on all four counts. Daniel J. Shields, Harry Widman, J. M. Gastman guilty on first count and recommended to mercy of court. Not guilty on 2d, 3d and 4th counts, this 13th day of February, 1926\n\n\n\n'E. B. Milligan, Foreman.'\n\n Upon this verdict the court rendered its judgment, sentencing Shields to pay a fine of $2,000 and to be imprisoned in jail for one year. Shields then filed in court a petition alleging that not until April 21, 1926, more than two months later, did he or his counsel have any knowledge of the tentative verdict sent by the jury to the judge in chambers, or of the reply thereto by the judge, and praying that he be allowed an exception to the action of the judge in sending the reply. The court refused to grant the petition, for the reason, as stated by it:\n'That counsel for the defendant Daniel J. Shields requested the court to hold the jury in deliberation until they should agree upon a verdict, and therefore, when the court received the communication from the jury, it was returned with the instructions complained of, although it is true that the defendant's counsel was not present when the communication was handed to the court from the jury.\n\n'(Signed) Per Curiam, S.' \n\n[273 U.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n An exception was allowed, however, to the foregoing refusal to grant an exception, the record reciting in this respect:\n\n'Eo die an exception to the above refusal to grant an exception is hereby noted to the defendant Daniel J. Shields.\n\n'F. P. Schoonmaker, Judge.'\n\n Shields took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals, assigning among other errors the action of the District Court in sending the communication to the jury and the refusal of the court to grant an exception to that action. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the judgment, said:\n'The justified reliance of court on the request of counsel, avoidance of abortive mistrials, and the timely administration of a court's work, based on the verdict of a jury which had evidence to support it, all unite in making the case one where with one breath a court can not be asked by counsel to take a step in a case, and later be convicted of error because it has complied with such request, for, as is said in 17 Corpus Juris 373, 374: 'A defendant in a criminal case cannot complain of error which he himself has invited.'\n\n The petitioner urges first that the request joined in by counsel for the defendants, that the jury be held in deliberation until they had reached a verdict, could not be properly construed as a consent that the court might communicate with the jury out of court and in the absence of the defendants and their counsel; second, that the action of the District Court in thus communicating with the jury was a denial to petitioner of due process of law; third, that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals upholding that action is in conflict with the decision of this court in Fillippon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76\n, 39 S. Ct. 435; Fourth, that the instruction in the \n\n[273 U.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n communication to the jury that it 'will have to find also whether Shields, Widman, and Gastman are guilty or not guilty,' was additionally erroneous because in violation of section 1036 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1702), which authorizes a jury to bring in a verdict as to those of the defendants regarding whom they are agreed, and declares that the case as to the other defendants may be tried by another jury; fifth, that in this respect the instruction of the District Court runs counter to the decision of this court in Bucklin v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 680, 682\n, 16 S. Ct. 182, 305; and, sixth, that the direction to the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty or not guilty as to the three defendants named had the effect of coercing the jury into rendering a verdict which they were plainly reluctant to return.\n The Solicitor General advises us that, after a careful study of the record in this case, the government is unable to find any satisfactory ground for opposing the petition for a writ of certiorari, and that no brief in opposition will therefore be filed, and, if the writ issues, the government will submit the case without being heard further.\n In view of this, we deem it proper to dispose of the case at once. On the statement of the case as we have given it, we think the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed on the first and third grounds urged, and the cause remanded to the District Court for a new trial. The joint request to the court of counsel for the defendant and the assistant district attorney to hold the jury in deliberation until they should agree upon a verdict, made in chambers without the presence of the defendant, cannot be extended beyond its exact terms. It did not include any agreement that the court should receive a communication from the jury and answer it, without giving the defendant and his counsel an opportunity to be present in court to take such action as they might be advised, especially when the communication as \n\n[273 U.S. 583, 588]\n\u00a0\n to the result of the deliberations of the jury showed a marked difference in the views which the jury had as to the guilt of the various defendants. Counsel, in making it, necessarily assumed, as they had a right to, that any communication from the jury would be made in open court, and that they must necessarily be offered an opportunity to withdraw the request already preferred or to vary it. It is hardly fair to say that a general request to hold the jury for a verdict can be properly applied to such a situation as subsequently developed by the communication of the jury showing their views as to the various defendants.\n In the case of Fillippon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76\n, 39 S. Ct. 435, which was a suit for damages for personal injuries, it appeared that after the trial judge had completed his instructions, and the jury had retired for deliberation, and while they were deliberating, it sent to the judge a written inquiry on the question of contributory negligence, to which the trial judge replied by sending a written instruction to the jury room, in the absence of the parties and their counsel, and without their consent, and without calling the jury in open court. A new trial was ordered on this account. The court said:\n'Where a jury has retired to consider of its verdict, and supplementary instructions are required, either because asked for by the jury or for other reasons, they ought to be given either in the presence of counsel or after notice and an opportunity to be present; and written instructions ought not to be sent to the jury without notice to counsel and an opportunity to object.'\n\n If this be true in a civil case, a fortiori is it true in a criminal case? The request made jointly by the counsel for the defendant and for the government to the court did not justify exception to the rule of orderly conduct \n\n[273 U.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n of jury trial entitling the defendant, especially in a criminal case, to be present from the time the jury is impaneled until its discharge after rendering the verdict. We reverse the judgment without reference to the other causes of error assigned.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHUKERT v. ALLEN(1927)\nNo. 193\nArgued: Decided: March 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. B. McIlvaine, of Chicago, Ill., and Arthur F. Mullen, of Omaha, Neb., for petitioners.\n Mr. Thomas H. Lewis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of a federal estate tax paid by the plaintiffs, petitioners, under duress. The District Court directed a verdict for the defendant, the collector (300 F. 754), the judgment upon which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (6 F.(2d) 551). A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n269 \nU.S. 543\n, 46 S. Ct. 24.\n The tax was levied under the Revenue Act of 1918, Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18,  402(c), 40 Stat. 1057, 1097 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 c), which provides that the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including all property 'to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has ... created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' etc. By section 401 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 b) the tax is laid upon the transfer of the net estate. The transfer taxed in this case was made by the testator on May 5, 1921, and was a conveyance to the United States Trust Company of Omaha of notes and bonds valued at $225,000, par, in trust to accumulate the income (subject to certain small deduc- \n\n[273 U.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n tions in case of the extreme destitution of the testator's wife or of any of the beneficiaries named) until February 1, 1951, unless the last of the beneficiaries should have died more than twenty-one years before that date, etc., and then to divide the principal and undistributed income among his three children by name. The testator died on September 29, 1921, a few months after creating this trust, but it is not argued that he created it in contemplation of death as a device to escape taxes. The only question is whether the trust was one intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his death, as was ruled below.\n The transfer was immediate and out and out, leaving no interest remaining in the testator. The trust in its terms has no reference to his death but is the same and unaffected whether he lives or dies. Although the Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have thought otherwise, the interest of the children respectively was vested as soon as the instrument was executed, even though it might have been divested as to any one of them in favor of his issue if any, or of the surviving beneficiaries, if he died before the termination of the trust. See Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities,  108(3). It seems plain from the little evidence that was put in that the testator was not acting in contemplation of death as a motive for his act, or otherwise, except in the sense that he was creating a fund intended to secure his children from want in their old age, whoever might dissipate the considerable property that he retained and left at his death; and that being fifty-six years old, if he thought about it, he would have contemplated the possibility or probability of his being dead before the emergency might arise. Of course it was not argued that every vested interest that manifestly would take effect in actual enjoyment after the grantor's death was within the statute. There certainly is no transfer taking effect after his death to be taxed under section 401. \n\n[273 U.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n It is not necessary to consider whether the petitioner goes too far in contending that section 402(c) should be construed to refer only to transfers of property the possession or enjoyment of which does not pass from the grantor until his death. But it seems to us tolerably plain, that when the grantor parts with all his interest in the property to other persons in trust, with no thought of avoiding taxes, the fact that the income vested in the beneficiaries was to be accumulated for them instead of being handed to them to spend, does not make the trust one intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor's death.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSIMMONS v.

Bryant, of Hartford, Conn., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles Fairhurst and William A. Davenport, both of Greenfield, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the petitioner for breach of a contract. At the trial the judge directed a verdict for the defendant and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 11 F.(2d) 267. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n273 \nU.S. 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 91.\n By the contract the defendant agreed to sell to the petitioner, the plaintiff, a pickle factory, its specified equipment, and the good will of the business. For this the plaintiff agreed to pay $15,000, as follows: $ 500 on the signing of the agreement, 'check for which is hereby acknowledged'; $2,500 to be paid on or before October 1, 1923; $12,000 by the plaintiff's note to the defendant's order, carrying interest at 6 per cent. and payable on demand, to be secured by mortgage on the property conveyed. The defendant was also to convey the pickles then in tanks on the premises for which the plaintiff was to pay the sum of $4 per thousand \n\n[275 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n by a note signed by himself, F. C. Gould and Thomas J. Molumphy as joint makers. The time for performance was on or before October 1, 1923, and the place the office of Davenport & Fairhurst, Greenfield, Massachusetts. Time was declared to be of the essence of the contract and in case of the plaintiff's failure to perform any of his agreements, the $500 paid at the time of signing was to be retained as liquidated damages. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was ready, willing and able to perform his part. If in view of the facts any matter of waiver or excuse should have been pleaded, no question of pleading was raised and none is open here.\n A short statement of the dominant facts as they might have been found seems to us sufficient to show that the plaintiff had a right to go to the jury. The plaintiff and his party went to the appointed place on the appointed day, but the defendant was not there and his whereabouts were not to be ascertained, until about 2 o'clock when he telephoned that he was on his way to Greenfield and probably should be there by three. He arrived somewhere about 5 or later. After some discussions necessary to finish the business, at from 6 to 7 the papers were signed and ready. The plaintiff then offered to the defendant for the $2,500 that he was to pay, a certificate of deposit from the Produce National Bank of South Deerfield- a bank near by the of unquestioned solvency. The defendant thereupon asked his lawyer if he had got to take it; the lawyer intimated that he was not bound to, and the defendant said, 'Well, if I haven't got to take it, I am not going to take it; and I will simply say good night, gentlemen;' took his hat and coat and walked out. Of course at that hour the banks were closed and the plaintiff could not get legal tender before the next day. In consequence of a frost the price \n\n[275 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n of pickles had risen greatly, and the judge at the trial said that it was perfectly obvious that the defendant was trying to get out from under his contract. It will be noted that the contract contemplated that the first payment should be by check, and on September 22 the defendant had sent to the plaintiff a letter addressed to the Silver Lane Pickle Company, assumed to be interested, asking for a 'check in full for the pickle stock' for which by the agreement he was to receive a note; the amount, as it turned out, being nearly $15,000. In such circumstances and in view of the way in which business is done at the present day, it might be found to have been natural and reasonable to suppose that a certificate of deposit from a well-known solvent bank in the neighborhood would be enough. It seems likely that it would have been except for the defendant's desire to escape from his contract. If without previous notice he insisted upon currency that was strictly legal tender instead of what usually passes as money, we think that at least the plaintiff was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to get legal tender notes, and as it was too late to get them that day might have tendered them on the next. But the jury might find also that the defendant's behavior signified a refusal to go farther with the matter and therefore that the plaintiff was not called upon to do anything more. If these were found to be facts, as they might be, the defendant broke his contract and the plaintiff has a right to recover. We have not mentioned some qualifying details insisted upon by the defendant because we have to consider only what the jury might find. The qualifications do not impress us but there are some important contradictions. The defendant will have an opportunity to present them if the case is tried again. See Servel v. Jamieson (C. C.

C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n These are suits brought in the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico to restrain the collection of taxes imposed by the laws of Porto Rico. On January 7, 1927, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed decrees of the District Court dismissing the bills. On March 4, 1927, by chapter 503,  7, of the Acts of that year, Congress provided that section 48 of the act to provide a civil government for Porto Rico should be amended to read as follows:\n'Sec. 48. That the Supreme and District Courts of Porto Rico and the respective judges thereof may grant writs of habeas \n\n[275 U.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n corpus in all cases in which the same are grantable by the judges of the District Courts of the United States, and the District Courts may grant writs of mandamus in all proper cases.\n\n'That no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment of collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Porto Rico shall be maintained in the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico.'\n\n 44 Stats. 1418, 1421 (48 USCA  872).\n Writs of certiorari were granted by this court on May 16, 1927, but argument was ordered on the question whether the cases had not become moot by virtue of that act.\n Apart from a natural inclination to read them more narrowly there would seem to be no doubt that the words of the statute covered these cases. To maintain a suit is to uphold, continue on foot and keep from collapse a suit already begun. And although the Circuit Court of Appeals in Gallardo v. Porto Rico Ry., Light & Power Co., 18 F.(2d) 918, 923, with some color of authority has held that the act does not apply, we cannot accept that view. To apply the statute to present suits is not to give it retrospective effect but to take it literally and to carry out the policy that it embodies of preventing the island from having its revenues held up by injunction; a policy no less applicable to these suits than to those begun at a later day, and a general policy of our law. Rev. Stat.  3224 ( 26 USCA  154 (Comp. St.  5947)). So interpreted the act as little interferes with existing rights of the petitioners as it does with those of future litigants. There is no vested right to an injunction against collecting illegal taxes and bringing these bills did not create one. Hallowell v. Commons, \n239 \nU.S. 506, 509\n, 36 S. Ct. 202. This statute is not like a provision that no action shall be brought upon a contract previously valid, which in substance would take away a vested right if held to govern contracts then in force. It does not even attempt to validate previously unlawful taxes. It simply makes it plain that these cases are not excepted from the well \n\n[275 U.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n known general rule against injunctions. It does not leave the taxpayer without power to resist an unlawful tax, whatever the difficulties in the way of resisting it.\n The sequence of the clause in the amendment after others giving authority to grant writs of habeas corpus and mandamus shows that it puts a limit to the power of the court. See Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 \nU.S. 118, 119\n, 36 S. Ct. 275. That is a question of construction and common sense. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 28 S. Ct. 641. Therefore when the District Court required a deposit in the registry of a sum to secure payment of the tax in dispute, the money should be returned as there is no jurisdiction to dispose of it otherwise.\n Of course it does not matter that these cases had gone to a higher court. When the root is cut the branches fall. McNulty v. Batty, 10 How. 72.\n As the bills were dismissed upon the merits (with partial injunction in Valdes v. Gallardo and Finlay, Waymouth & Lee, Inc. v. Gallardo) the decrees should be reversed and the cases sent back with directions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.\n Decrees reversed and bills ordered to be dismissed.\n Money deposited in court for payment of taxes in case of adverse decision to be returned.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND was absent. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

Rucks, of Angleton, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants, some of whom are citizens of Texas, filed their bill in the District Court for Southern Texas against \n\n[273 U.S. 388, 389]\n\u00a0\n appellees, the county commissioners of Brazoria county, certain tax officials of that country, and the commissioners of the Brazos River harbor navigation district and others, all citizens of Texas. The relief prayed was a preliminary and final injunction restraining appellees from levying assessments on appellants' land and from issuing or selling bonds pursuant to a plan authorized by the Act of February 19, 1925, c. 5, General Laws of Texas,  7, creating a taxing district to raise funds to defray the cost of a proposed improvement of navigation at the mouth of the Brazos river.\n The jurisdiction of the district court was based solely upon allegations in the bill that the Texas statutes and the proceedings had under them for the formation of the Brazos River harbor navigation district violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.\n No application was made for a preliminary injunction. Testimony was taken before a special master and final hearing had before three judges on the assumption that a trial by three judges was required by section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925,  1 (Comp. St.  1243). From the judgment of the district court, dismissing the bill on the merits, (13 F.(2d) 1007), the case has been brought here by direct appeal under sections 238 and 266 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St. 1215, 1243), which permit an appeal from a final decree in an injunction suit of this kind in which the final hearing must be had before three judges, as provided in that section. The jurisdiction of this court turns on whether or not section 266, as amended, required the hearing below to be before three judges.\n Section 266 before the amendment of February 13, 1925, required, as it still does, all applications for an interlocutory injunction testraining state officers from enforcing state statutes or orders of administrative boards or com- \n\n[273 U.S. 388, 390]\n\u00a0\n missions, upon the ground of unconstitutionality, to be heard by a court of three judges. But as the section then stood, the final hearing might be had before a single district judge who might arrive at a different conclusion from that reached on the preliminary hearing by the three judges, one of whom was a justice of the Supreme Court or a circuit judge. Compare Patterson v. Mobile Gas Co., \n271 \nU.S. 131\n, 46 S. Ct. 445, and Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, 42 S. Ct. 244. To remove this anomaly and save the right of direct appeal to this court from the operation of the repealing provisions of the Act of February 13, 1925, section 266 was amended by the addition of the following provisions:\n'The requirement respecting the presence of three judges shall also apply to the final hearing in such suit in the district court; and a direct appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction in such suit.'\n\n See Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461, 465\n, 46 S. Ct. 577\n\n\n It is to be noted that this amendment provides that the 'requirement' of a court of three judges 'shall also apply' to the final hearing 'in such suit.' The question now presented is whether the phrase 'such suit' was intended to refer only to a suit in which a preliminary injunction had been in fact sought or to a suit in which an application for such an interlocutory injunction might have been but in fact was not made. Before the amendment the section applied only when interlocutory relief was actually sought, regardless of the scope of the bill, and direct appeal to this court was permitted only from the determination of the court of three judges on such an application. The general purpose of the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936) was to relieve this court by restricting the right to a review by it. Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n272 \nU.S. 317\n, 47 S. Ct. 105. The specific purpose of the amendment to \n\n[273 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n section 266, as already noted, was to end the anomalous situation in which a single District Judge, on the final hearing might reconsider and decide questions already passed upon by the three judges on the application for an interlocutory injunction. Both purposes are accomplished if the amendment is taken as its language suggests, not to extend the application of the section with respect either to the requirement of three judges or the right of direct appeal to any case in which an interlocutory injunction is not sought.\n We conclude that the section as amended does not require a court of three judges on the final hearing unless an application for preliminary injunction is pressed to a hearing. In that case, an appeal either from the determination on the preliminary application or from the final decree may be taken directly to this court. The plaintiff is thus given an election. He may either make application for an interlocutory injunction, which must be heard by three judges, in which case the final hearing must be before a like court with appeal directly to this court, or he may not press an application for an interlocutory injunction, in which case the final hearing may be before a single judge, whose decision may be reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and this court under other applicable provisions of the Judicial Code. Here there was no application for an interlocutory injunction and hence no necessity for a final hearing before three judges, although it may not have been erroneous for three judges to sit, a question we do not find it necessary to decide. There is therefore no jurisdiction in this court to hear the appeal, which must accordingly be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMYER v. U.S.(1927)\nNo. 131\nArgued: January 14, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. E. J. Smyer, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought to recover upon the official bond of Smyer, who was postmaster at Birmingham, Ala., the amount of moneys embezzled by one Smith, Assistant superintendent of mails at that office. The moneys came into Smith's hands as collections made by him upon numerous C. O. D. parcels, or collected upon such parcels by letter carriers and turned over to him. The condition of the bond is that the postmaster 'shall faithfully discharge all duties and trusts imposed on him by law and by the regulations of the Post Office Department.' \n\n[273 U.S. 333, 334]\n\u00a0\n All parcel post matter which came to the office was in charge of Smith. Parcel post matter and money order business were separately handled in different departments of the office. It was Smith's duty to receive and handle C. O. D. parcels, and collect from the addressees the amounts called for upon tags attached to the parcels, and thereupon purchase from the money order department money orders payable to the senders of the parcels for the several amounts. These tags, signed by the addressees, were considered by the Post Office Department as applications for money orders payable to the senders of the parcels. The moneys so collected were converted to Smith, and never came into the hands of any one connected with the money order department. The court below affirmed a judgment in favor of the government. 6 F.(2d) 12.\n The right of the government to recover depends upon the construction and application of sections 4045 and 3846, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  7577, 7208), copied in the margin. \n1\n We are of opinion that under neither section is there liability upon the bond.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 333, 335]\n\u00a0\n The language of section 4045, so far as pertinent here, is that 'all money received for the sale of money orders, including all fees thereon, ... shall be deemed and taken to be money order funds and money in the Treasury of the United States.' We are of opinion that, until the money intended for the purchase of money orders, reaches the hands of the postmaster, or some employee of the post office, authorized to issue money orders, it has not been received for the sale of money orders within the meaning of the language quoted. These sums of money were received, not for the sale-that is, as a price paid in for money orders-but for the purchase of money orders. That by the words, 'for the sale of money orders,' was meant a completed purchase, is borne out by the phrase immediately following, 'including all fees thereon.' There could, of course, be no money received for fees on the sale of money orders here until actual payment to the money order department. The section further requires that it shall be the duty of the assistant treasurer, at the request of the Postmaster General, to open an account of 'money order funds' deposited by postmasters to the credit of the Postmaster General, etc. It cannot have been intended that money, collected for the specific purpose of buying a money order for the sender of a parcel, might be deposited to the credit of the Postmaster General as 'money order funds' before being put to that use. Section 4045 was enacted on June 8, 1872, while the act providing for the collection on delivery of articles sent by parcel post was not passed until August 24, 1912. 37 Stat. 539, 558, c. 389. Certainly, when section 4045 was originally enacted, Congress could have had in mind only a completed purchase, since a situation like the present was not then provided for. And while that consideration would be of no value where the language of the statute plainly applied to conditions subsequently arising, it may aid to some degree in the construction of a statute where, as here, the words are of doubtful import. \n\n[273 U.S. 333, 336]\n\u00a0\n In United States v. Mann (D. C.) 160 F. 552, a similar collection was made by a rural letter carrier, and having failed to purchase a money order for the sender he was indicted under section 4046 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  7578) for converting to his own use 'money order funds.' The contention of the government as to the application of section 4045 was the same as here, but the court held that the money did not constitute money order funds, and directed a verdict of not guilty. In the course of an opinion subsequently filed, it was said:\n'It is nothing more or less than money which the regulation of the Postmaster General authorizes his qualified employee to accept from the citizen, with the duty of purchasing a money order therewith. It becomes no part of the 'money order funds' until that purchase has been made, and then it is within the category of the first class of the definition, viz. 'money received for the sale of money orders.\"\n\n Nor is the case for the government helped by the more general language of section 3846. By that section, postmasters must keep safely 'all the public money collected by them, ... until it is ordered by the Postmaster General to be transfered or paid out.' The collections made by or turned over to Smith were in his hands for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of being remitted in the form of money orders to the persons for whom the collections were made and to whom the moneys equitably belonged. True, these moneys came to Smith's hands under color of his office, but subject to no form of disposition except for the use to which they were specifically devoted. Public money, within the meaning of section 3846, obviously is money belonging to the United States in such sense that it may be ordered by the Postmaster General to be transferred or paid out. It seems clear that the sums of money here in question were not subject to that control until \n\n[273 U.S. 333, 337]\n\u00a0\n after they had reached the hands of the money order department.\n There is a clear distinction between public money and these sums of money received by an employee of the office charged with the specific duty of transmitting them to their real owners in a definitely prescribed manner. That money though received under color of office may not be public money, is clearly recognized by section 225 of the Criminal Code (35 Stat. 1088, 1133, c. 321 (Comp. St.  10395)), which defines the offense of embezzlement in part as the conversion by any person in the postal service of any money coming into his hands under color of his office, whether the same shall be the money of the United States or not.\n Judgment reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice STONE dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 4045. All money received for the sale of money orders, including all fees thereon, all money transferred from the postal revenues to the money order funds, all money transferred or paid from the money order funds to the service of the Post Office Department, and all money order funds transferred from one postmaster to another, shall be deemed and taken to be money order funds and money in the Treasury of the United States. And it shall be the duty of the assistant treasurer of the United States to open, at the request of the Postmaster General, an account of 'money order funds' deposited by postmasters to the credit of the Postmaster General, and of drafts against the amount so deposited, drawn be him and countersigned by the Sixth Auditor.\n Sec. 3846. Postmasters shall keep safely, without loaning, using, depositing in an unauthorized bank, or exchanging for other funds, all the public money collected by them, or which may come into their possession, until it is ordered by the Postmaster General to be transferred or paid out. \n\n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY. CO. v. COMMONWEALTH(1927)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward P. Humphrey, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. J. P. Hobson, of Frankfort, Ky., for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A judgment against plaintiffs in error for franchise taxes imposed under the laws of Kentucky in respect of \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n certain lines of railway was affirmed by the highest court of that state. 204 Ky. 388, 264 S. W. 850. And see 193 Ky. 474, 237 S. W. 11. Reversal is sought on the ground that, as applied, these laws contravene the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The statutes1 (sections 4077-4081) provide that every foreign or domestic railway company, in addition to other taxes imposed by law, shall pay an annual tax on its franchise. The provisions apply whether the privilege is exercised by the corporation in its own name or in the name of another which it adopts. A company's railway system is deemed to include lines operated, leased, or controlled, whether technically owned or not. The tax is on intangible property. Where the railroad is partly within and partly without the state, the value of the intangible property so to be taxed may be determined substantially as follows: Capitalize the net railway operating income of the entire system for the accounting year last ended; assign to Kentucky its mileage proportion of that amount; deduct the assessed value of the tangible property otherwise taxed; and the remainder is the value taken as the basis for the franchise taxes. When the railroad is wholly within the state, the capitalized net, less the assessed value of tangible property on which other taxes are paid, is taken to be the value of intangible property. Greene v. Louis. & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 U.S. 499\n, 510, and cases cited, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Louis. & Nash. R. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 522, 539\n, 37 S. Ct. 683, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 97.\n Plaintiff in error the Southern Railway Company is a Virginia corporation. The lines of its systems of railroads, exclusive of the Kentucky mileage in question, exceed 9,500 miles, and extend from Washington, D. C., into Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. The company also has a line from New Albany, Ind., to East St. Louis, Ill. It does \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n not own any railroad in Kentucky. The 'Southern Railway Company in Kentucky' owns 127.63 miles, all of which are in that state. Its branches connect with the line of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Company, which extends from Cincinnati to Chattanooga, and connects it with the system. Its stock is owned by the Virginia company. The same persons are officers of both. The lines of the Kentucky company are reported to public authorities and are advertised as a part of the system. The Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, the Cumberland Railroad Company, and the Cumberland Railway Company own, in all, about 53.3 miles of railroad in Kentucky, but their lines are not connected with the lines of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky. The Virginia company through stock ownership controls these companies; but they and the Southern Railway in Kentucky, in their own names and as owners, made reports and paid in full all taxes assessed under Kentucky laws on their tangible and intangible properties.\n The commonwealth brought this suit against the Virginia company and the Director General to recover additional franchise or intangible property taxes for 1918 and 1919 in respect of the Kentucky mileage of these companies. The Court of Appeals held that there was no such connection or unity of use between the system of the Virginia company and the lines of the Mobile & Ohio, the Cumberland Railroad, and the Cumberland Railway, as would justify recovery of any franchise taxes in respect of their Kentucky mileage. Stipulated facts tended to show that the Virginia company controlled the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific; and the court held that, by means of its lines, the railroad of the Southern Railway in Kentucky was so connected with the lines of the Virginia company as to be a part of the system. The value of intangible property adjudged to have been omitted, and on which the additional franchise taxes were \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n calculated, for 1918 was $1,730,090.02, and for 1919 was $3,028,592.62. These amounts were arrived at as follows: The net railway operating income for the entire system was capitalized at 7 per cent.; there was deducted an amount to cover the value of shops, terminals, and double tracks outside Kentucky in excess of corresponding tangible property connected with the lines in that state; there was allocated to Kentucky such proportion of the remainder as 424.61 miles, which were attributed to Kentucky, bore to the total mileage of the system; that amount was equalized for taxation at 75 per cent. for 1918 and at 85 per cent. for 1919; and from the result there was deducted the values of tangible and intangible property (including the Kentucky mileage of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific) on which taxes had been paid. But the average value per mile so deducted was less than the system average per mile. The amounts so arrived at were assigned to the 127.63 miles of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky and the 197.5 miles in Kentucky of the lines of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific. The increase per mile for 1918 was $5,334.55, and for 1919 was $9,338.34.\n The Court of Appeals rightly declared that a state may tax property permanently within its jurisdiction belonging to one domiciled elsewhere and used to carry on commerce among the states; that, where property is a part of a system and has its actual use only in connection with other parts of the system, that fact may be considered, even though other parts of the system are outside the state; that the state may not tax property outside its jurisdiction belonging to one domiciled elsewhere; and that the mileage basis of apportionment cannot be adopted in the taxation of railroad franchises where the result is shown to be arbitrarily excessive. These propositions are derived from the decisions of this court. \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 499\n, 24 S. Ct. 498; Pittsburgh, etc., Railway Co. v. Backus, \n154 U.S. 421\n, 427-431, 14 S. Ct. 1114; Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275, 282\n, 39 S. Ct. 276; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 40 S. Ct. 435.\n The question is whether the state made valid application of the governing principles. The value of tangible property is not involved in this case. The demand of the commonwealth against the plaintiffs in error was for taxes on intangible properties over and above the amounts that had been paid by the owning companies. And the entire amount added as a basis for additional taxes is attributable only to the lines of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky. There was no claim for any taxes in respect of the lines of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific. That company had also reported its earnings and paid taxes on its tangible and intangible properties in Kentucky. These taxes were based on values per mile in excess of the average values per mile for the system arrived at by capitalization of net railway operating income in accordance with the rule applied by the state. No part of the amounts adjudged to have been omitted could properly be assigned thereto. The Mobile & Ohio, the Cumberland Railroad, and the Cumberland Railway, were held not to be a part of the system. Plaintiffs in error insist that the enforcement of the taxes on these amounts, as measuring the additional values of intangible properties inhering in the lines of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky, operates to tax the property of the Virginia company located beyond the borders of Kentucky, and that such amounts are arbitrarily excessive.\n The value of the physical elements of a railroad-whether that value be deemed actual cost, cost of reproduction new, cost of reproduction, less depreciation or some other figure-is not the sole measure of or guide to \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n its value in operation. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 547\n, 18 S. Ct. 418. Much weight is to be given to present and prospective earning capacity at rates that are reasonable, having regard to traffic available and competitive and other conditions prevailing in the territory served. No intangible element of substantial amount over and above the value of its physical parts inheres in a railroad that cannot earn a reasonable rate of return on its bare bones-as the mere tangible elements properly may be called. See Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., \n218 \nU.S. 180, 202\n, 30 S. Ct. 615, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1084\n\n\n The amount adjudged to have been omitted equals an increase on the lines of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky of $13,555 per mile for 1918 and of $23,730 for 1919. The 1917 average net operating income per mile for the system was the basis for determining the Kentucky franchise taxes for 1918, and the average for 1918 controlled the amount of the 1919 taxes. The average for the system was $3,642 per mile for 1917, and was $3, 623 for 1918. The corresponding net income per mile of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky for 1917 was $878. There was a loss of $4,741 per mile in 1918. The record also shows a loss in each of the years 1914, 1915, and 1916. The average for the five years was a loss of $1,230 per mile per year.\n If considered alone, the railroad of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky would be a losing venture. Its operating loss was more than $157, 000 per year for the average of the five years reported in the record. But, assuming it a part of the system, it is right to take into consideration the parts outside the state that are operated in connection with it. The mileage used as an integral part of a railroad system may have elements of value that it otherwise would not possess, and the state properly may have regard to the whole in order to ascertain the value of the part that is within its borders. Fargo v. Hart, supra, 499 (24 S. Ct. 498). But, if the method pursued in valuing prop- \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n erty within the state is arbitrary, and the resulting valuation is grossly excessive, the tax must be condemned as in contravention of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, supra, 282 (39 S. Ct. 276) and cases cited. It is not permissible for the state to take into account any of the outside property, 'unless it can be seen in some plain and fairly intelligible way that it adds to the value of the road and the rights exercised in the state.' Wallace v. Hines, supra, 69 (40 S. Ct. 436).\n The operating results of the system, compared with those of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky, show that, on the basis of valuation adopted by the state, the average value per mile of the lines of that company is very much less than the average value per mile of the system. If taken separately, it is clear that, because of lack of net earnings, no substantial intangible elements of value could reasonably be attributed to the railroad of that company. In order to justify the increases made, there would have to be attributed to these lines large amounts from system earnings. To sustain the addition for 1919, it is necessary to take enough to overcome the deficit of $4,741 per mile, plus a fair return on the value of the physical property and on the $23,730 per mile fixed as a basis for additional taxes. The draft on earnings from other parts of the system to sustain the increase for 1918 would not be so heavy. But it is equally obvious that there is no foundation for the finding that there existed in these lines intangible values of $1,730,090, or any other substantial amount in excess of the value fairly to be attributed to the physical elements of the railroad. If intangible elements were attributed to the system at the same rate per mile as results from the distribution of the added amount to the mileage of the Southern Railway in Kentucky, their value would be more than $200,000,000 for 1919 and more than $120, 000,000 for 1918. Clearly there is no foundation for any such results. The mere \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n statement of the figures is sufficient to show that the amount added as a basis for franchise taxes is so excessive and unreasonable that it cannot be sustained; and such an application of the system earnings amounts to an attempt to tax property outside the state. And, as the direct earnings per mile of the lines of that company are so much less than the average for the system, it is plain that the amount adjudged to have been omitted was arbitrarily excessive and included values of system property beyond the limits of Kentucky.\n Moreover, the percentages used to make the apportionment to Kentucky were too high. Reference to the figures for 1919 will be sufficient. There was taken 4,273 per cent. of $432,326,444.12, the system value to be apportioned. The system mileage was 9,939.1, and that used for the apportionment was 424.61. The Southern Railway Company in Kentucky had 127. 63 miles, the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific, 197.5, the Mobile & Ohio, 38.693, the Cumberland Railroad, 12.9 and the Cumberland Railway, 1. 74. As the court held that the lines of the three companies last mentioned were not so connected with the system that plaintiffs in error were liable in respect of them, their mileage was erroneously included in the factor used for apportionment to the lines taxed. And, for the reasons stated, the mileage of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific should not have been included. The mileage used to make the apportionment was more than three times that of the Southern Railway in Kentucky, and was more than 30 per cent. in excess of the combined mileage of that company and the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific. Obviously deduction of the lesser values of the Kentucky mileage on which the owners had paid taxes did not eliminate the error.\n The enforcement of the franchise taxes so assessed would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 85]\n\u00a0\n The commonwealth asserts that in the Kentucky courts the company did not make 'the objection which is made here that this was a tax on property outside the state.' But the record shows the contrary. The petition alleged that a portion of the Kentucky franchise had been omitted from assessment, and prayed that such portion be assessed and taxed. The answer of plaintiffs in error not only denied liability and alleged that to hold the company liable and to attempt to add to that assessment would be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, but it also stated:\n'Defendants say that the effort made herein is simply for the purpose of endeavoring to bring into the state of Kentucky, for purposes of taxation, property not in Kentucky, and values appertaining to property not in Kentucky, and earnings derived from property not in Kentucky; that to do this would be in violation of ... the Constitution of the United States, particularly the Fourteenth Amendment thereof.'\n\n In its first decision (193 Ky. 474, 488, 237 S. W. 11, 17), the Court of Appeals said:\n'It is our conclusion, therefore, that the court should have assessed against defendant (Southern Railway Company of Virginia) Kentucky's portion of its intangible property assessed by the proportion of the mileage that the lines nominally operated by the 'Southern Railway Company in Kentucky' bear to the entire mileage of defendant's system estimated according to the method provided by the statute. But it is insisted that this would result in taxing in Kentucky property having no situs here. ...'\n\n Then follows the court's answer to that contention. This shows that the court distinctly recognized and passed upon the contention that the imposition of the additional franchise taxes would be to tax property outside Kentucky. That decision, according to the local rule, not only bound the lower court, but controlled the disposition of the case on the second appeal. Hopkins v. Adam Roth Grocery Co., 105 Ky. 357, 358, 49 S. W. 18. The objec- \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 86]\n\u00a0\n tions were reiterated in an amended answer filed after the first decision. And the Court of Appeals in its second decision declared that the additional assessments 'were made in accordance with, and are concluded by, the former opinion herein.' Clearly, the objections made in the state courts were sufficient. They went to the point that, as proposed to be applied and enforced, the state statutes would operate to tax property outside and beyond the jurisdiction of Kentucky, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. And, notwithstanding these objections, the Court of Appeals in its first decision directed the making of these additional assessments; and, in its second decision, declared that they had been made as directed and affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court by which they were determined.\n A petition for certiorari was filed, but, as the case is properly here on writ of error, the petition will be denied.\n Judgment reversed on writ of error.\n Petition for certiorari denied.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n I do not consider the merits of this case, because, in my opinion, it should be affirmed on a point of practice which was urged here by the commonwealth. On writ of error to a state court, even where, as here, this court has jurisdiction, no objection is reviewable which was not made there. The question on which the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is reversed was not raised or passed upon below.\n The claim made below was that the Southern could not be taxed at all in Kentucky under the unit rule, and that therefore the statute as applied was void. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 U.S. 282\n, 288-290, 42 S. Ct. 106. The commonwealth admitted that the Southern, a Virginia corporation, did not own the Kentucky lines di- \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 87]\n\u00a0\n rectly. The Southern admitted that it controlled them by stock ownership. In support of the claim that the unit rule could not be applied, the Southern made two contentions. The first was dealt with by the Court of Appeals in its first opinion (193 Ky. 474, 237 S. W. 11); the second, in its second opinion (204 Ky. 388, 264 S. W. 850). The first contention was that the unit rule could have no application, because the Southern was not doing business in Kentucky. That contention the Court of Appeals decided against the Southern for all the years; and this court affirms the ruling. The second contention was that the unit rule did not apply, because there was not unity of use and operation of the Kentucky lines with its lines elsewhere. The question depended upon the amount of control exercised by the Southern Railway Company over the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway, which connected the Southern Railway in Kentucky with the rest of the Southern system. This contention the Court of Appeals decided in favor of the Southern for the years 1914, 1915, and 1916, but against it for the years 1917 and 1918. With this ruling also this court agrees. The reversal by this court is based on an entirely different claim. It is on the ground that the method of assessment used was such as to furnish, as a basis for the franchise tax, an amount so unreasonable and arbitrary as to involve taxation of property outside the state, in view (1) of the fact that the per mile earnings of the entire system were so much larger than the per mile earnings of the Southern in Kentucky; and (2) of the supposed use of too large a percentage intended to represent the proportion of the mileage in Kentucky to the total mileage of the system.\n The Court of Appeals recognized clearly that it could not tax in Kentucky any property outside its limits. It upheld the tax as an increase of assessment upon property located confessedly in Kentucky, applying the rule of Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 338\n, 43 S. Ct. 366, 368 ( 67 L. Ed. 682) that-\n'If \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 88]\n\u00a0\n the property be part of a system and have an augmented value by reason of a connected operation of the whole, it may be taxed according to its value as part of the system, although the other parts be outside the state; in other words, the tax may be made to cover the enbanced value which comes to the property in the state through its organic relation to the system.'\n\n Applying the unit rule, however, there are two grounds on which a decision sustaining the claim that property outside the state has been taxed might have rested, if the appropriate claim had been made below. It might have been held that the statute, so far as it required the adoption of the mileage plan of valuation, was void as applied, because the different character of the line outside Kentucky precluded the application of the per mile method as a basis of valuation. Compare Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490\n, 24 S. Ct. 498; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 40 S. Ct. 435. Or it might have been held that the tax was void, because the additional assessment based on mileage without the state was so arbitrary and unreasonable in amount as to violate due process. Compare Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275\n, 39 S. Ct. 276; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 70 S., 40 S. Ct. 435. But neither of these claims was made in the court below. The only contentions made there were those which this court and the lower court agree in holding unfounded, namely, that the Southern was not doing business in Kentucky and that there was no such unity of use and operation of the lines within and those without the state as to permit of the application of the unit rule. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 76, 89]\n\u00a0\n The second opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals recites that 'it is admitted that the assessments for 1917 and 1918 were made in accordance with and are concluded by the former opinion.' Hence it was necessary for the plaintiff in error to show that the objections insisted upon in this court were raised upon the first trial or the appeal in the state court. \n2\n A consideration \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 90]\n\u00a0\n of the entire answer and of the entire first opinion make it altogether clear that the contention, which was advanced by the answer and refuted by the opinion, consisted solely of the claim that any assessment against the Southern would be unconstitutional as taxing property outside the state, because the Southern was not doing business within the state. Neither the record nor the opinion of the Court of Appeals discloses that there was an objection to the assessment as such. Nowhere in the opinion is there any reference to the figures urged here as showing the arbitrariness of the statute as applied.\n It cannot be said 'that the necessary effect in law of a judgment, which is silent upon the question, is the denial of a claim or right which might have been involved therein, but which in fact was never in any way set up or spoken of.' Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193, 200\n, 19 S. Ct. 379, 381 (43 L. Ed. 665). The rule that a claim or right which was not asserted in the state court cannot be deemed to have been denied, and hence cannot be insisted upon in this court has been long established. \n3\n It is true also that the party defeated upon a federal question in a state court will not be limited in this court to the same arguments upon that question (Dewey v. Des Moines, supra, at page 198 (19 S. Ct. 379)), and that, if the federal question is properly raised, it is immaterial that the state court may have refused to discuss the point (Erie R. R. Co. v. Purdy, \n185 \nU.S. 148, 154\n, 22 S. Ct. 605). But, \n\n[274 U.S. 76, 91]\n\u00a0\n if the contention made below differs from the contention made here to such a degree that the decision upon one would not necessarily conclude the other, the raising of one below will not permit the raising of the other here, even if the same provision of the Constitution be the basis of both claims. Compare Dewey v. Des Moines, supra; Marvin v. Trout, \n199 U.S. 212\n, 223-224, 227, 26 S. Ct. 31.\n The importance of the rule of practice is illustrated by the case at bar. 4 Because the reasonableness of the method of assessment was not questioned below, there is nothing in the record to show what figures and what method of calculation were used by the taxing officers. The figures adopted by this court are presented only in the brief of the plaintiff in error. They are protested by counsel for the commonwealth. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the inferences drawn from them are unsound. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provisions are printed in the margin of Louis. & Nash. R. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 U.S. 522\n, at page 533, 37 S. Ct. 683, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 97. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The reason urged by the Southern in support of the second contention was, as the second opinion recites, that the Kentucky lines 'had neither physical nor operative connection with lines outside of the state, ... and that to apply the notion of organic unity to all its lines under such circumstances is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it brings into Kentucky for taxation purposes values wholly outside of the state. Whether or not this is true is the sole question presented for decision upon these appeals.' The Court of Appeals decided the second contention in favor of the Southern for the years 1914, 1915, and 1916, because it concluded 'that there was in fact no physical connection between the Northern branch and the Southern branch of the defendant's lines, and that, despite the defendant's ownership and control of both of these separate branches, they cannot, under the many decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, be considered as parts of a single system for the purpose of ascertaining the value of defendant's franchise employed in Kentucky without violating the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.' It held the Southern taxable for the years 1917 and 1918, because in 1917 the 'defendant acquired the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Company, and thus unified all of its holdings into a single unit of use and management.' In considering the situation for the earlier years, it stated: 'The question for decision then finally narrows to whether for the purpose of valuing defendant's franchise employed in Kentucky, the line from Danville, Ky., to St. Louis, Mo., is to be considered as a separate unit or as a part of a system including also defendant's eastern and southern lines.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As showing that they were raised, this court relies upon the allegation of the answer that 'the effort made herein is simply for the purpose of endeavoring to bring into the state of Kentucky for purposes of taxation, property not in Kentucky; ... that to do this would be in violation of ... the Fourteenth Amendment,' and upon a quotation from the first opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals to the effect that 'it is insisted that this would result in taxing in Kentucky property having no situs here. ... The reliance of this court appears to rest upon a misapprehension. On the first trial, the lower courts dismissed the state's petition. As no method of assessment was before the Court of Appeals, it could not, in its first opinion, have passed upon the arbitrariness of this or any other method of assessment. See 193 Ky. 474, 489, 237 S. W. 11. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In 1836 Mr. Justice Story, because of the fact 'that a different impression exists at the bar,' reviewed all the cases that had reached this court from the state courts, finding that they exhibited 'a uniformity of interpretation ... which has never been broken in upon,' requiring that, in order to give the court jurisdiction, the question sought to be reviewed had both to be raised in the court below and there decided.

Arnold, of New York City, opposed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion by Spiller to amend the judgment of this Court and retax costs in St. Louis & San Francisco R. R. v. Spiller, \n274 \nU.S. 304\n, 47 S. Ct. 635, which was decided on May 16, 1927. The October term, 1926, closed on June 6. Under rule 31, the issue of the mandate was necessarily deferred until after the close of the term, as no order shortening the time for issue had been made. It was filed in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court of Appeals on August 4, 1927. This motion, filed August 22, 1927, was submitted on the first day of this term.\n The mandate directed that the petitioners recover $2,219.70 'for their costs herein expended and have execution therefor.' The judgment entred by this court had made no express provision as to costs. It directed merely:\n'That the decree of the said United States Circuit Court of Appeals in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed in part and reversed in part, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this court.'\n\n The opinion stated:\n'The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed, in so far as it reversed the decree of the District Court dismissing the intervening petition, and is reversed in so far as it directed that the judgment is a prior lien, enforceable for the full amount, exclusive of counsel fees, against the property of the new company.' Page 316 (47 S. Ct. 639).\n\n The relief sought does not involve amendment of the judgment entered. The motion is aimed at the alleged mistake of the clerk in including the direction for the \n\n[275 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n payment of costs in the mandate. Clerical errors of that nature, if occurring, may be corrected after expiration of the term at which the judgment was entered. Compare The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 10; Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Wistar, 3 Pet. 431, 432; Jackson v. Ashton, 10 Pet. 480; Bank of United States v. Moss, 6 How. 31, 38; Alviso v. United States, 6 Wall. 457; Schell v. Dodge, \n107 \nU.S. 629, 630\n, 2 S. Ct. 830. There is added reason for allowing correction where the clerical error was made during the vacation of the court.\n Was there such an error here? In other words, was the clerk's action contrary to an applicable statute, or not in keeping with the rules and practice of the court? The contention most strongly urged by Spiller is that immunity from costs was conferred by paragraph 2 of section 16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended. Acts of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 382, 384, June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  5, 24 Stat. 584, 590, and February 28, 1920, c. 91,  424, 41 Stat. 474, 491 (49 USCA  16 (Comp. St .  8584)). That paragraph, which deals with suits to enforce reparation orders issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, provides:\n'Such suit in the Circuit (District) Court of the United States shall proceed in all respects like other civil suits for damages, except that on the trial of such suit the findings and order of the Commission shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, and except that the petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the Circuit (District) Court nor for costs at any subsequent stage of the proceedings unless they accrue upon his appeal. If the petitioner shall finally prevail he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee, to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit.'\n\n The argument is that this suit is a 'subsequent stage' of the action against the carrier commenced by Spiller in the District Court for Western Missouri and prosecuted \n\n[275 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n there to final judgment. This proceeding arises out of the same cause of action which was the basis for the reparation order and for that action. But it is, in no sense, an 'appeal' of the action brought in the Western district. In that action Spiller 'finally prevailed' in 1920, when the judgment in personam recovered against the carriers in the District Court for Western Missouri was reinstated by this court. Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117\n, 40 S. Ct. 466. This proceeding is a new and independent one. It is directed at parties other than the carriers against whom the reparation order and that judgment issued. It is a petition based on that judgment, filed in the receivership proceedings pending in the District Court for Eastern Missouri, and seeks to enforce an alleged lien or equity against property which once belonged to the carrier and which passed upon foreclosure sale to other parties. If this were, as contended, 'a subsequent stage' of the original action, Spiller would have been entitled in this proceeding to an 'attorney's fee, to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs.' The Circuit Court of Appeals denied recovery in this case even of the attorney's fees forming a part of the judgment recovered in the Western district. That ruling was acquiesced in by Spiller, and, in this respect, the judgment was affirmed by this court. \n274 \nU.S. 304, 316\n, 47 S. Ct. 635. The purpose of Congress in making the provision concerning costs was to discourage harrassing resistance by a carrier to a reparation order. It was not to deny in independent litigation against third persons a customary incident of success. What the clerk did was not contrary to any provision of the Act to Regulate Commerce.\n The question remains whether the clerk was justified by rule and practice in inserting in the mandate the direction concerning costs. Prior to the January term, 1831, costs were seldom allowed in this court upon a \n\n[275 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n reversal. But see Turner v. Enrille, 4 Dall. 7, 8; Wilson v. Mason, 1 Cranch, 45, 102. Compare Mr. Justice Baldwin, 5 Pet. 724. Rule 37 adopted at that term, made each party chargeable with one- half of the legal fees for a copy of the printed record. 5 Pet. 724. Compare McKnight v. Craig's Adm'r, 6 Cranch, 183, 187, and rule 22, adopted at the February term, 1810, 1 Wheat. xvii. Rule 47, adopted at the January term, 1838, provided that in all cases of reversal, except for want of jurisdiction, costs shall be allowed in this court to the plaintiff in error or appellant, unless otherwise ordered by the court. 12 Pet. vii. Rule 24(3) of the Revised Rules adopted at the December term, 1858, eliminated the exception concerning reversals for want of jurisdiction. 21 How. xiv. The rule as then revised has remained in force ever since without substantial change. See \n108 U.S. 587\n; 222 U. S. Appendix, 29. It is now embodied in rule 29(3) of the Revised Rules adopted June 8, 1925. \n266 U.S. 675\n. At no time has the rule expressly prescribed whether costs shall be allowed when the judgment or decree below is reversed only in part. But it has long been the practice of the clerk to insert in the mandate, in such cases, the provision for payment of costs by the defendant in error, appellee, or respondent, in the absence of specific direction by the court. The acquiescence of the court in this practice has operated to give effect to it as a practical construction of the rule. We are of opinion that the rule was properly applied in this case. Compare Baldwin v. Ely, 9 How. 580, 602. Therefore there has been no clerical error for us to correct.\n Motion denied. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST. LOUIS & S. F. R. CO. v. SPILLER(1927)\nNo. 577\nArgued: April 12, 1927Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick H. Wood, of New York City, and Edward T. Miller, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Messrs. W. H. Saunders, of St. Louis, Mo., and D. A. Murphy, of Kansas City. Mo., for respondents. \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1913, the federal court for eastern Missouri appointed receivers for the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad. In 1916, the system was sold on foreclosure, was purchased for the reorganization committee and was conveyed to the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, which has operated it since. In 1920, Spiller recovered in the federal court for western Missouri a judgment against the old company in personam for $30, 212.31 and for counsel fees taxed as costs pursuant to section 16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8584)1. Thereupon he filed in the receivership suit,2 upon leave granted, an intervening petition praying that the judgment be satisfied out of the property so acquired by the new company. The master recommended that the prayers of the petition be granted. The District Court denied Spiller any relief and dismissed the intervening petition, without costs to either party. 288 F. 612. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree, remanded the case to the lower Spiller in the amount of the judgment, with sipller in the amount of the judgment, with interest, but without counsel fees, declared that the judgment was prior in lien and superior in equity to the mortgages of the old company, and directed that it be enforced against the property conveyed to the new company. 14 F.(2d) 284. This court granted the petition of the two companies for a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 680\n, 47 S. Ct. 111, 71 L. Ed. -.\n The judgment which Spiller seeks to enforce through the intervening petition was entered by the trial court \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n in 1916, after the foreclosure sale and before confirmation thereof, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in 1918, and was reinstated by this court in 1920. Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117\n, 40 S. Ct. 466. It is for overcharges collected by the old company, in 1906, 1907, and 1908 under a freight tariff which had been increased in 1903, and which was held by the Interstate Commerce Commission to be unreasonable in 1905 and again in 1908. Cattle Raisers' Association v. Missouri, Kansas & Texas R. R. Co. et al., 11 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 296; Id., 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 418. The action in which the judgment was recovered was begun in 1914, after the appointment of the receivers. The reparation order on which the action was based was entered also after their appointment, but the petition for reparation was filed prior thereto.\n The validity of the judgment as against the old company is not challenged in this proceeding. The question here is whether Spiller is entitled to have it satisfied out of the property of the new company. The railroads contend that in nature the claim is one not entitled to preferential payment; and that, in any event, Spiller is barred by laches or otherwise from obtaining any relief in this suit. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the old company became liable as trustee ex maleficio for overcharges and that this liability is enforceable, as upon a constructive trust, against the property acquired by the new company on foreclosure. It held further that Spiller was not barred by laches or otherwise, because of the provision of the foreclosure decree, by which the purchaser became bound to pay, as a part of the purchase price, any unpaid claims of creditors of the old company which should be adjudged superior in equity to its mortgages, the court reserving to itself jurisdiction to determine the amount and validity of any such claim.\n First. The contention that the judgment constitutes a lien or equity upon the property of the new company, \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n as upon a constructive trust, rests upon the following argument: The freight rates being unreasonable were unlawful. The shipper was obliged to pay the charges exacted, although they were unlawful, because they were the published rates. As the shipper was obliged to pay the unlawful charges the payment was made under duress. One may be held as trustee ex maleficio of funds obtained by duress as well as of those procured by fraud. The old company by collecting the unlawful charges became trustee ex maleficio of the funds collected. These can be traced and may be followed. They passed to the receivers who took the funds with notice and without paying value. Upon the foreclosure they passed to the new company. It also took them with notice and is subject to the trust, either because the shipper's equitable lien or interest was not cut off by the foreclosure sale, to one with notice, in a suit to which the shipper was not a party, or because the new company agreed to pay pursuant to the foreclosure decree claims prior in lien and superior in equity to the mortgages of the old company.\n We need not consider whether, in the absence of legislation, charges illegally exacted by a carrier may be recovered under the doctrine of a constructive trust, or whether the alleged equitable remedy is applicable to overcharges subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, which provides a different remedy,3 or whether the equitable remedy, if any, has been lost by proceeding to judgment at law; for even if the overcharges, when collected, were subject to a constructive trust in favor of the shipper, the contention that the money exacted by \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n the old company in 1906, 1907, and 1908 can be traced into the hands of the receivers is unfounded. The money was not earmarked. It was mingled when collected with other money received from operation. And no special account was kept of it. The latest exaction occurred five years before the appointment of the receivers. The assertion that the money collected can be traced into the receiver's hands is confessedly without any support except the stipulated fact that, throughout the ten years which elapsed between the earliest exaction and the transfer of the properties to the new company, the old one and the receivers had, at all times, in the several banks on which checks for current expenses were drawn, a working balance, in the aggregate, largely in excess of Spiller's claim. Such a showing fails to bring the present case within the rule by which, when trust funds are mingled with others, the cestui may assert an equitable lien upon the mingled mass to the extent of his contribution thereto.4 American Can Co. v. Williams (C. C. A.) 178 F. 420, 423; In re A. D. Matthews' Sons (C. C. A.) 238 F. 785, 787. An illegal exaction does not impress an indelible trust upon all funds which the wrongdoer and his successors may thereafter have on deposit in their banks. For aught that appears, all the money illegally exacted may have been spent for current operating expenses.\n Second. Spiller contends that he was entitled to preferential payment of his judgment for the excess charges, out of operating income accruing during the receivership, on the doctrine of Fosdick v. Schall, \n99 U.S. 235\n, 251-255. See New York Dock Co. v. The Poznan, No. 229, \n274 \nU.S. 117\n, 47 S. Ct. 482, decided April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 304, 311]\n\u00a0\n It is argued that the test of this equity is the nature of the claim; that a liability for excess charges unlawfully exacted by the carrier before the receivership is an expense of operation like a debt incurred for labor, supplies, equipment or improvements; and that, as such, it is entitled to priority over bondholders. We need not determine whether the noncontractual claim here in suit is in its nature within the class of debts entitled to preferential payment under the doctrine of Fosdick v. Schall. For, by long established practice, the doctrine has been applied only to unpaid expenses incurred within six months prior to the appointment of the receivers. See Lackawanna Coal Co. v. Trust Co. \n176 \nU.S. 298, 316\n, 20 S. Ct. 363. Compare Gregg v. Metropolitan Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 183\n, 25 S. Ct. 415. The cases in which this time limit was not observed are few in number and exceptional in character. See Burnham v. Bowen, \n111 U.S. 776\n, 780-783, 4 S. Ct. 675; Union Trust Co. v. Morrison, \n125 \nU.S. 591\n, 8 S. Ct. 1004. In no case which has come to our attention has the doctrine been applied to liabilities which, like those here in question, accrued many years before the receivership began.\n Third. Preferential payment is urged also on the ground of public policy. The argument is that the carrier is invested through its franchise with a part of the sovereign power; that in the exercise of the power conferred the old company exacted illegal rates which the shipper was obliged by law to pay; that when the old company's property passed into the hands of the court it was augmented by the illegal exactions; that it became the court's duty to make restitution; and that, having failed to do so while the property was in its hands, the court may require payment from the new company. It may be assumed that this claim for overcharges is meritorious in character; but the fact that it arose many \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 312]\n\u00a0\n years before the appointment of the receivers is conclusive against including it among those entitled to preferential payment.\n Fourth. In order to establish as against the new company either the alleged equity or a right to preferential payment, it was moreover assumed to be necessary that the claim should be one of those which the purchaser, under the decree of foreclosure, agreed to pay, as part of the purchase price. The decree provided that the purchaser would not be required to pay any 'claim or demand which has not been presented in this cause in accordance with the orders, heretofore made, requiring presentation thereof' unless it be 'a claim or demand which may arise after the entry of this decree.' An interlocutory decree had ordered that all claims be presented before February 1, 1916, or be barred of enforcement against the property in the hands of the receivers or the proceeds thereof. Due notice of the order had been given by publication. Spiller did not file his claim within the time limited. He contends that the time limit has no application to his claim, because it arose after entry of the decree.\n The argument is that while the claim accrued in 1914, when the reparation order was entered, or earlier when the overcharges were illegally collected, it did not 'arise' until 1920 when this court, reversing the Circuit Court of Appeals, reinstated the judgment sought to be enforced by the intervening petition; that, in this connection, the term 'arise' must have been used by the District Court in a sense different from 'accrues.' For, knowing through its receivers, that their counsel were, at the time of the entry of the decree of foreclosure, hotly contesting Spiller's claim, and that he was asserting that it was superior in equity to the mortgages to be foreclosed, and knowing also that the claim had not been filed in the receivership suit, the court must have intended that if \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 313]\n\u00a0\n Spiller ultimately prevailed, his claim should be satisfied by the new company. Unless so construed, the provision for claims which may 'arise' after the decree would be practically inoperative. The argument is not persuasive. We are of opinion that the term 'arise' was used in the decree as the equivalent of 'accrue'; that Spiller's claim arose at least as early as 1914, when the reparation order was entered, not when the judgment was recovered; Ry. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 662, 666\n, 35 S. Ct. 444, 59 to pay it. See Phillips v. Grand Trunk Sy. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 662, 666\n, 35 S. Ct. 444. Moreover, while the barring clause of the final decree excepted claims arising after entry thereof, the clause stating the liability of the purchaser included only claims against the old company which should be adjudged prior in equity to the old company's mortgages. We have already decided that the claims in question are not of such a character.\n Fifth. Spiller contends also that he is entitled, under the doctrine of Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S. Ct. 554, to require the new company to satisfy in full his judgment against the old. The argument is that, under the reorganization plan, stockholders of the old company were allowed to participate in the new, but that he, a creditor, was not offered an opportunity to do so. There is no evidence in the record which supports the assertion that Spiller was not afforded an opportunity of participating in the reorganization. The contrary appears. The order confirming the foreclosure recites that 'a fair and timely offer of cash ... or participation' was made to those unsecured creditors who had filed claims. Spiller did not file his claim. The fact that he did not have actual knowledge of the order limiting the time for filing claims is not material in this connection. Notice by publication was legally sufficient. The mere fact that his claim was contested did not exclude him from the scope of the order. He might have \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 314]\n\u00a0\n filed it although he was litigation elsewhere. He cannot bring himself within the doctrine of the Boyd Case by showing that no offer was made to him personally. For aught that appears an offer would have been made, or his rights otherwise preserved, if he had filed his claim. There is no occasion to consider whether a petition for intervention filed in the receivership proceedings four years after confirmation of the foreclosure sale is an appropriate method of enforcing the claim on this theory.\n Sixth. While the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in granting the specific relief prayed in the petition for intervention, it does not follow that Spiller must be denied all remedy. He was guilty of a serious inadvertence in not filing his claim in the receivership suit within the time limited by the interlocutory order. But it is clear that he has not been guilty of laches. Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, \n250 U.S. 483\n, 488- 490, 39 S. Ct. 533. And it does not appear that his inadvertence misled in any way the court, the receivers, the reorganization committee or the new company. He had prosecuted his claim with vigor for years before the receivers were appointed. His diligence does not appear to have slackened either during the receivership or after the foreclosure sale. Throughout the whole period, the claim appears to have been resisted with equal vigor. After the old company ceased to function, counsel for the receivers conducted the defense. After the receivers ceased to function, counsel for the new company conducted the defense. It is clear that neither the receivers nor the new company considered the failure to file the claim in the receivership a bar to the relief.\n Before Spiller recovered judgment in the trial court, the sale on foreclosure was had; but the hearing on the order to confirm the sale was yet to be held. At that hearing Spiller gave, before the confirmation of the sale, notice in open court, and otherwise to the old company, the receivers, to the reorganization committee and \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 315]\n\u00a0\n to the new company, that he had recovered judgment 14 days before. He notified them that he claimed that the purchaser would take the property subject to all his rights; and that these included a charge upon the property in the hands of the purchaser for full payment of the judgment. With knowledge of Spiller's claims, the reorganization committee and the new company took over the property. Later, the new company assumed the further defense to the action in which the judgment had been recovered. The issue of the securities of the new company and the distribution of its stock among stockholders in the old occurred after these notices of Spiller's claim had been given. Under such circumstances, neither the long delay, nor the failure to file claims as required by the interlocutory and final decrees, should operate to prevent the appropriate relief;5 and the District Court had jurisdiction to grant it. Compare Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93\n, 24 S. Ct. 399; Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, \n208 U.S. 38\n, 54-57, 28 S. Ct. 182.\n The new company contends, that since the shipper's claim was not filed within the time limited by the interlocutory decree it was among those declared barred by the terms of the final decree; and that by intervening he estopped himself from obtaining any relief. \n6\n No good reason is shown why relief may not be had as well upon an intervening petition as upon an original bill. As this may be done, he should be put, as nearly as may be consistently with the rights of others, into the position which he would have occupied had he filed his claim in the \n\n[274 U.S. 304, 316]\n\u00a0\n receivership proceedings in the proper time. It does not appear that it is not possible for the new company to give him the benefit now of the offer which was made by the reorganization committee to the other unsecured creditors of the old company; nor that such a course would be inequitable to others in interest. The ascertainment of the relevant facts and the precise form of the relief must be left to the District Court. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed in so far as it reversed the decree of the District Court dismissing the intervening petition, and is reversed in so far as it directed that the judgment is a prior lien enforceable for the full amount exclusive of counsel fees against the property of the new company.\n Decree affirmed in part, and reversed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion to amend judgment and retax costs denied 275 U.

MELLON(1927)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 12, 13]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John B. Johnson, of Tallahassee, Fla., and Peter O. Knight, of Tampa, Fla., for the State of Florida.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., and Robert P. Reeder, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for defendants.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 12, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Florida seeks leave to file a bill of complaint against the defendants, citizens of other states, to enjoin them from attempting to collect in Florida inheritance taxes imposed by section 301 of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 69, 70. A rule upon the defendants to show cause why such leave should not be granted was issued and answered.\n The complaint alleges that under the Constitution of Florida no tax on inheritances can be levied by the state or under its authority; that, by section 301 of the act referred to, certain graduated taxes are imposed on the estates of decedents subject to the following provision:\n'The tax imposed by this section shall be credited with the amount of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory or the District of Columbia, in respect of any property included in the gross estate. The credit allowed by this subdivision shall not exceed 80 per centum of the tax imposed by this section, and shall include only such taxes as were actually paid and credit therefor claimed within three years after the filing of the return required by section 304.'\n\n It is further alleged that the defendants are officers of the United States and are seeking to enforce the provisions of section 301; that citizens of Florida have died since the act was passed, leaving estates subject to taxation under the terms of that section; that defendants have required and are requiring the legal representatives of such decedents to make returns under that section, and, unless such action is restrained, it will result in the withdrawal from Florida of several million dollars per annum, and thus diminish the revenues of the state derived \n\n[273 U.S. 12, 16]\n\u00a0\n largely from taxation of property therein; that the state is directly interested in the matter, because it raises by taxation a sufficient amount of revenue to pay the expenses of the state government otherwise than by imposing inheritance taxes or taxes on incomes; and that the provisions of the said section constitute an invasion of the sovereign rights of the state and a direct effort on the part of Congress to coerce the state into imposing an inheritance tax and to penalize it and its property and citizens for the failure to do so. It is further alleged that the state is directly interested in preventing the unlawful discrimination against its citizens which is effected by section 301, and in protecting them against the risk of prosecution for failure to comply with the enforcement provisions of the act; that the several states, except Florida, Alabama, and Nevada, levy inheritance taxes, but, by reason of the provisions of its Constitution, Florida cannot place its citizens on an equality with those of the other states in respect of the tax in question, and therefore the tax is not uniform throughout the United States, as required by section 8 of article 1 of the federal Constitution.\n The allegations of the bill suggest two possible grounds upon which the asserted right of complainant to invoke the jurisdiction of this court may be supported: (a) That the state is directly injured because the imposition of the federal tax, in the absence of a state tax which may be credited, will cause the withdrawal of property from the state with the consequent loss to the state of subjects of taxation; and (b) that the citizens of the state are injured in such a way that the state may sue in their behalf as parens patriae. Neither ground is tenable.\n While judicial relief sometimes may be granted to a quasi sovereign state under circumstances which would not justify relief if the suit were between private parties (Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488), nevertheless it must appear that the state has suffered \n\n[273 U.S. 12, 17]\n\u00a0\n a wrong furnishing ground for judicial redress or is asserting a right susceptible of judicial enforcement. The mere fact that a state is the plaintiff is not enough. Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 287\n, 8 S. Ct. 1370; Oklahoma v. A., T. & Santa Fe Ry., \n220 \nU.S. 277, 286\n, 289 S., 31 S. Ct. 434.\n The act assailed was passed by Congress in pursuance of its power to lay and collect taxes, and, following the decision of this court in respect of the preceding act of 1916 (New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660), must be held to be constitutional. If the act interferes with the exercise by the state of its full powers of taxation or has the effect of removing property from its reach which otherwise would be within it, that is a contingency which affords no ground for judicial relief. The act is a law of the United States, made in pursuance of the Constitution, and therefore the supreme law of the land, the Constitution or laws of the states to the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever the constitutional powers of the federal government and those of the state come into conflict, the latter must yield. Ex parte Virginia, \n100 U.S. 339\n, 346; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 606\n, 16 S. Ct. 644; Cummings v. Chicago, \n188 \nU.S. 410, 428\n, 23 S. Ct. 472; Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 77.\n The contention that the federal tax is not uniform, because other states impose inheritance taxes while Florida does not, is without merit. Congress cannot accommodate its legislation to the conflicting or dissimilar laws of the several states, nor control the diverse conditions to be found in the various states, which necessarily work unlike results from the enforcement of the same tax. All that the Constitution (article 1 ,  8, cl. 1) requires is that the law shall be uniform in the sense that by its provisions the rule of liability shall be alike in all parts of the United States.\n The claim of immediate injury to the state rests upon the allegation that the act will have the result of inducing potential taxpayers to withdraw property from the state, \n\n[273 U.S. 12, 18]\n\u00a0\n thereby diminishing the subjects upon which the state power of taxation may operate. The averment to that effect, however, affords no basis for relief, because, not only is the state's right of taxation subordinate to that of the general government, but the anticipated result is purely speculative, and, at most, only remote and indirect. Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n194 \nU.S. 48, 68\n, 70 S., 24 S. Ct. 598. If, as alleged, the supposed withdrawal of property will diminish the revenues of the state, non constat that the deficiency cannot readily be made up by an increased rate of taxation. Plainly, there is no substance in the contention that the state has sustained, or is immediately in danger of sustaining, any direct injury as the result of the enforcement of the act in question. See in re Ayers, \n123 \nU.S. 443, 496\n, 8 S. Ct. 164; Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S. Ct. 597\n\n\n Nor can the suit be maintained by the state because of any injury to its citizens. They are also citizens of the United States and subject to its laws. In respect of their relations with the federal government-\n'it is the United States, and not the state, which represents them as parens patriae, when such representation becomes appropriate; and to the former, and not to the latter, they must look for such protective measures as flow from that status.' Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra, pages 485, 486 (43 S. Ct. 600).\n\n It follows that leave to file the bill of complaint must be denied.\n Rule discharged, and leave denied. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA v. FIRST NAT. BANK OF ST. PAUL(1927)\nNo. 245\nArgued: December 13, 1926Decided: March 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Patrick J. Ryan, Clifford L. Hilton, and G. A. Youngquist, all of St. Paul, Minn., for the State of Minnesota.\n Messrs. Thomas D. O'Brien, Alexander E. Horn, and Edward S. Stringer, all of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the court.\n The state of Minnesota, the petitioner, brought suit in the district court of Ramsey county, Minn., to recover from the First National Bank of St. Paul, the respondent, taxes assessed against its shareholders for the years 1921 and 1922. Respondent resisted the payment of the tax on the ground that the assessment was at a higher rate than that on moneyed capital employed in competition with national banks, and hence prohibited by section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  9784). The trial court gave judgment for petitioner. On appeal judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota and a new trial ordered. 164 Minn. 235, 204 N. W. 874. Upon the second trial, had upon the record of the first, the district court held that at the time of the assessment of the taxes in question 'a substantial and relatively material portion of the money and credits so listed and assessed in said \n\n[273 U.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n Ramsey county consisted of moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of said county, coming into competition with the business of national banks in said county, and with the business of said defendant.' Judgment in respondent's favor was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota. 164 Minn. 235, 205 N. W. 375. This court granted certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 550\n, 46 S. Ct. 121; Judicial Code,  237(b), being Comp. St.  1214\n\n\n The questions raised are similar to those considered in First National Bank of Hartford v. City of Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548\n, 47 S. Ct. 462, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this day, and may be disposed of by the application to the present facts of the principles there considered.\n Under the Minnesota statutes, shares of national banks and the moneyed capital of banks or mortgage loan companies organized under the laws of the state are assessed and taxed at 40 per cent. of their full value in the district where located. Gen. Stat. 1923,  2023; Laws 1921, c. 416. Money and credits are taxed at the rate of 3 mills on the dollar of their full cash value and are exempt from all other taxation. Gen. Stat. 1913,  2316; Laws of 1911, c. 285. Mortgages upon real estate and executory contracts for the sale of real estate are separately taxed at a lower rate; 15 cents per $100 where the period to run is for five years or less, and 25 cents per $100 on mortgages and contracts for a longer period. Gen. Stat. 1913,  2301, et seq.; Laws 1921, c. 445. Money is defined as gold and silver coin, all forms of currency, and all deposits subject to withdrawal on demand. Credits include every demand for money or other valuable thing. Gen. Stat. 1923,  1980; Laws 1917, c. 130. Under these statutes money and credits, as defined, are taxed at the 3-mill rate and mortgages on real estate at a lesser rate.\n It appears that the tax assessed upon the shares of respondent was 67 mills in 1921 and 61 1\/2 mills in 1922. Although based upon a 40 per cent. valuation, the actual rate upon the shares was \n\n[273 U.S. 561, 564]\n\u00a0\n higher than the prescribed tax of 3 mills per dollar of full valuation of money and credits and therefore was discriminatory. Petitioner argues that in its actual operation, the tax on national bank shares is no greater than the tax on credits, since under the statute individuals are taxed at the rate of 3 mills upon the full value of their credits without deducting their liabilities, whereas in taxing bank shares, the liabilities of the banks are deducted from their assets in ascertaining the 40 per cent. valuation of their shares. Therefore, it is urged, if bank shares were taxed at the same rate without deducting the bank's liabilities in ascertaining the value of their shares, the amount of the tax would be approximately the same. This argument ignores the fact that the tax authorized by section 5219 is against the holders of the bank shares and is measured by the value of the shares, and not by the assets of the bank without deduction of its liabilities (Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103\n, 44 S. Ct. 23), and that the bank share tax must be compared with the tax assessed on competing moneyed capital of individuals invested in credits, or the tax on capital invested by individuals in the shares of corporations whose business competes with that of national banks (Mercantile Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 156\n, 157 S., 7 S. Ct. 826; First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 348\n, 46 S. Ct. 135). Thus compared, the actual tax imposed upon the shares of respondent, like the tax imposed upon credits in the hands of individuals, is assessed without deducting the liabilities of their individual owners, but at different rates. This discrimination is prohibited by section 5219, if moneyed capital in the hands of individuals in Minnesota is employed in substantial competition with national banks within the state.\n The evidence shows that there were money and credits listed for taxation in the entire state during each of the years in question in excess of $400,000,000, exclusive of municipal bonds and recorded real estate mortgages, and \n\n[273 U.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n in Ramsey county alone, where respondent conducts its banking business, there were like money and credits in excess of $83,000,000, all of which were subject to the 3-mill tax. The evidence shows that in Ramsey county there were listed for taxation for 1921 in the hands of individuals, promissory notes amounting to $2,481,446, and bonds, exclusive of tax- exempt bonds and real estate mortgages, to $7,595,975; for 1922, notes to $ 1,648,810, bonds to $9,931,955. There was invested in those years in real estate mortgages in Minnesota over $185,000,000 annually. The investment of national banks in Minnesota in those years in real estate mortgages was in excess of $19,000,000, in United States government bonds in excess of $ 41,000,000 and in other securities $33,800,000. The share value of national banks in Minnesota in those years, not including real estate, was a little more than $60,000,000, and less than two-thirds of their total investment in the securities mentioned.\n Note brokers within the state in those years made loans to their customers upon paper which they sell to banks and other investors, amounting to as much as $100,000,000 annually. Much of this paper is sold outside of the state, but the amount sold to banks and to individuals within the state is substantial. One class of this paper known as 'cattle loan paper' exceeded $22,000,000 annually in the years in question, and of this $13,000,000 was sold to banks, corporations, firms and individuals in Minnesota. The amount shown to have been sold to individuals approximated $ 1,000,000. Eleven business concerns to whom respondent made loans, borrowed from their own officers and employees in one of the years in question about $1,500,000.\n Individuals and corporations using substantial capital are engaged within the state in business as investment houses, dealing in bonds and mortgages, such as normally enter into the business of banking. Two such corpora- \n\n[273 U.S. 561, 566]\n\u00a0\n tions in Ramsey county had a capital aggregating $2,250,000. One of them sold $13,000,000 of bonds in Minnesota in 1922, and had sold prior to May 1, 1921, mortgages which were still outstanding aggregating more than $25, 000,000.\n Taken as a whole, the evidence tends to show without material contradiction that there is a large amount of moneyed capital in the state employed in normal banking activities, such as loans, purchases and sale of notes, bonds, and real estate mortgages, and that large amounts of capital are invested and reinvested in such securities by individual investors within the state.\n But petitioner asserts that it does not appear from the record whether those engaged in the business of note brokers or in the business of acquiring and selling securities are individuals or corporations, and the amount of capital employed by any of them is not indicated. While this assertion is not borne out completely by the record, in the view we take, its truth is not of controlling consequence. The business and activities described could not be carried on in the volume indicated without the employment of large amounts of capital and in fact some corporations engaged in these activities were shown to have a large capitalization. It was not necessary that the particular amounts be specified. That capital, if invested in the business of individuals, is moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens, within the meaning of section 5219. If invested in corporations, as appears in some instances, the share capital in the hands of shareholders is likewise moneyed capital within the meaning of that section.\n It is said also that the evidence as to individuals was that large amounts of credits, including bonds, mortgages, and notes, were acquired by individuals by loan or purchase in the state and county, but that there is no evidence tending to show that any of these securities were held or employed by individuals in banking or investment business \n\n[273 U.S. 561, 567]\n\u00a0\n or in any other business. But, as we have held in First National Bank of Hartford v. City of Hartford, the competition guarded against by section 5219 may arise either from the employment of capital invested in a business, even though the competition be with some, but not all, phases of the business of national banks, or it may arise from the employment of capital invested by institutions or individuals in particular operations or investments like those of national banks.\n It is also urged that the record does not admit of a finding that the funds invested in these credits come into competition with national banks within the meaning of section 5219. To this it is answered by respondent that the court is required to take judicial notice of general conditions to which the law applies and that the taxing laws of Minnesota construed in the light of conditions generally known, show upon their face that they create a discrimination against national banks not permitted by the federal act. But it is unnecessary for us to enter upon the field of judicial notice, for it clearly appears from the evidence, as the court below found, that a large proportion of these investments consisted of investments of individuals out of surplus funds which they were investing and reinvesting in bonds, mortgages, and other evidence of indebtedness and that these transactions or continued activities are such as normally constitute an important part of the business of banking as conducted by respondent and other national banks in Minnesota. There is direct evidence, also, that the investments of individuals in this type of security aggregating large amounts lessens the opportunity for the investment of capital by national banks. The only witness called by petitioner admitted that to some extent such competition existed. In this state of the record we think the findings of the state court are supported by the evidence.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 561, 568]\n\u00a0\n That capital of individuals thus seeking investment and reinvestment in competition with the capital in national banks is moneyed capital coming into competition with the business of national banks within the meaning of section 5219 is the effect of our decision in First National Bank of Hartford v. City of Hartford, supra, and other cases there considered.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI v.

This order, set aside by the circuit court of Cole county, was reinstated by the Supreme Court of Missouri. 306 Mo. 149, 267 S. W. 102. The case is here on writ of error to that court, on the ground that the order results in an unconstitutional deprivation of property, impairs the obligation of contract, and violates paragraph 18,  1, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as added by Act May 29, 1917, and amended by Act Feb. 28, 1920,  402 (Comp. St.  8563). Judicial Code,  237, before amended (Comp. St.  1214).\n All the proceedings below were limited in their purpose and effect to the removal of the single grade crossing named. There is no dispute that the hazardous character of the crossing makes the separation of grades necessary. The controversy arises from the fact that the change in grade at Delmar Boulevard is the initial step in a general \n\n[273 U.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n scheme for abolishing all grade crossings within an extensive area of the city. Both the railroad and the city have evolved comprehensive plans for grade crossing elimination. The essential difference between the two programs is that the city proposes the depression of the railroad tracks with a consequent elevation of streets spanning the tracks by viaduct, while the railroad urges the elevation of the tracks upon embankments, leaving the streets at their present level. The Delmar Boulevard crossing is so situated that the commission's order directing depression of the railroad tracks there is a virtual, though not legal, adoption of the city plan to the extent that other crossings at grade in the vicinity can, as a practical matter, be eliminated only by depressing the tracks. The commission, however, expressly disclaimed passing on other details of the plan. A consideration of the proposed plans is necessary for a fuller understanding of the issues involved, although our review is limited to the immediate change at Delmar Boulevard directed by the order.\n The Wabash Railway passes from Delmar Boulevard southeasterly through a residential district, thence through Forest Park. The location of its tracks within this large public park was fixed by a contract with the park commissioners. The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, also a party to the proceeding, enters the city from the west, crosses the right of way of the Wabash several squares southeast of Delmar Boulevard, runs parallel with both the Wabash tracks and the northern end of Forest Park, and then joins the Wabash line, whose tracks it uses through the park to the Union Terminal. Its right to use the tracks is defined by the contract considered in Joy v. St. Louis, \n138 \nU.S. 1\n, 11 S. Ct. 243. It is not directly affected by the commission's order except insofar as the separation of grades at Delmar crossing amounts to an adoption of the city plan causing a change of level of the \n\n[273 U.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n Wabash tracks at other crossings and requiring a similar change of its own.\n The city plan, in its principal features, calls for the lowering of all the tracks within a cut screened from view, the relocation of the tracks within the park, so that the railroad would intersect with fewer streets as it emerges from the park, and the construction of viaducts with a verticle clearance of 18 feet. The plan also provides for the depression or abandonment of part of the Rock Island's tracks, for proper safeguards to be taken to obviate the danger of flood from a neighboring stream, and the purchase of additional land to increase the width of the right of way uniformly to 100 feet within a designated area. The railroad plan makes unnecessary the change of location of the right of way in the park, but involves the construction of unsightly embankments, which would materially reduce the value of residential property in the district. Each party makes claim for its plan the advantages of safety, economy, numerous mechanical and engineering conveniences, and the avoidance of certain mechanical and engineering hazards, all or most of which, it is insisted, the other lacks. The commission found that either plan is practicable from an engineering standpoint. The parties differ principally with respect to the prospective costs, the details of which, in view of the disposition to be made of the case, need not be considered.\n Treating the commission's order as an approval and effective adoption of the entire city plan, plaintiffs in error contend that the order deprives them of their property without due process of law; that it impairs the Wabash Railway's charter, its contract with the park commissioners, by which the present right of way of the railroad was located in Forest Park, and the contract under which the Rock Island is now using the tracks of the Wabash through the park, all in violation of article \n\n[273 U.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n 1,  10, of the Constitution. It is also urged that the order by its indirect adoption of the comprehensive city program calling for a partial abandonment and relocation of tracks is invalid as violating paragraph 18 ,  1, of the Interstate Commerce Act, which requires a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission before tracks may be abandoned or relocated.\n To support the burden of proving that the order of the commission is arbitrary and unreasonable, plaintiffs in error criticize numerous engineering features of the city's plan, especially the provision for an 18-foot clearance between tracks and viaduct, which is characterized as dangerous to life and limb.\n While the federal questions thus raised, so far as they relate to the order now before us, are not difficult of solution, in view of the complexity of the facts to which the principles announced by this court are to be applied, we cannot say that these questions are so unsubstantial as to deprive us of jurisdiction to pass upon them and to make proper disposition of the case as it is now presented.

Comm. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376. But we find it unnecessary to decide these questions because of the situation which has been created since the entry of the judgment below by the enactment of the Railroad Clearance Act. Laws of Missouri of 1925, pp. 323, 324. That statute provides that clearances over railroad tracks shall not be less than 22 feet, 'except in cases in which the Public Service Commission finds that such construction is impracticable.' The state commission directed that the clearance at Delmar Boulevard crossing be 18 feet, but it made no finding that the construction of a 22-foot clearance is impracticable. There is thus presented a question of state law; the effect \n\n[273 U.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n of this statute upon the commission's order, the judgment of the state Supreme Court, and upon action taken pursuant to them.\n Ordinarily this court on writ of error to a state court considers only federal questions and does not review questions of state law. Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590; Detroit & Mackinac Ry. v. Paper Co., \n248 \nU.S. 30\n, 39 S. Ct. 13. But where questions of state law arising after the decision below are presented here, our appellate powers are not thus restricted. Either because new facts have supervened since the judgment below (Kimball v. Kimball, \n174 \nU.S. 158\n, 19 S. Ct. 639: Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S.

Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503\n, 32 S. Ct. 542), this court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, may consider the state questions thus arising and either decide them ( Steamship Co. v. Joliffe, supra), or remand the cause for appropriate action by the state courts (Gulf, Col. & S. F. Ry. v. Dennis, supra; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n, 44 S. Ct. 323). The meaning and effect of the state statute now in question are primarily for the determination of the state court. While this court may decide these questions, it is not obliged to do so, and, in view of its nature, we deem it appropriate to refer the determination to the state court. Dorchy v. Kansas, supra, 290, 291 (44 S. Ct. 323). In order that the state court may be free to consider the question and make proper disposition of it, the judgment below should be set aside, since a dismissal of this appeal might leave the judgment to be enforced as rendered. Gulf, Col. & S. F. Ry. v. Dennis, supra, 509 (32 S. Ct. 542). The judgment is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI, EX REL. WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY v.

Turney, of El Paso, Tex., C. M. Cureton, of Austin, Tex., and C. W. Taylor, of Corsicana, Tex., for the State of Texas.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the State of New Mexico against the State of Texas in 1913 to settle a controversy \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 282]\n\u00a0\n concerning the location of the part of their common boundary extending southwardly in the valley of the Rio Grande River an air-line distance of about fifteen miles from the parallel of 32 degrees north latitude to the parallel of 31 degrees 47 minutes on the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. This is an off-set in the southern boundary of New Mexico extending nearly to El Paso.\n In its bill New Mexico alleged that under certain designated statutes and other public proceedings1 the channel of the Rio Grande as it existed in 1850 became and was the boundary of Texas and the Territory of New Mexico between these two parallels, that this boundary had 'remained unchanged' and 'now is' the boundary between the two States, and that a correct delineation of this line in the middle of the channel was shown on a map attached as an exhibit to the bill; and prayed specifically that 'the middle of the channel of the Rio Grande as it existed in the year 1850,' and as shown upon this map, be 'decreed to be the true boundary line.' In its answer and cross-bill Texas also alleged that the true boundary line is the channel of the Rio Grande as it existed in the year 1850, but denied the correctness of the location shown on the map exhibited with the bill, and alleged that the line was correctly delineated on a map attached as an exhibit to the answer, and prayed that the boundary line \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 283]\n\u00a0\n 'be declared to be the middle of the channel of the Rio Grande as it actually existed in the year 1850,' and as shown upon the map exhibited with the answer. And in its answer to the cross-bill New Mexico again stated that the true boundary line 'is the channel of the Rio Grande ... as it existed in the year 1850,' but denied that this was correctly located on the map exhibited with the answer.\n Each State thus asserted that the true boundary line is the middle of the channel of the Rio Grande in 1850. Neither alleged that there had been any change in this line by accretions. And the only issue was as to the true location of the channel in that year.\n Upon this single issue a large mass of testimony was taken before examiners, during a period of several years. Some of this, as bearing evidentially upon the location of the river in 1850, related incidentally to subsequent changes by accretions and avulsions. In 1924 New Mexico, on its motion, was allowed by the Court2 to take, subject to rebuttal, the additional testimony of one witness on the question whether, assuming that in what is known as the Country Club area, the river had been located in 1850 on the western side of the valley as claimed by Texas, it had thereafter moved eastward by accretions. But-still claiming that in fact the river was located in 1850 on the eastern side of the valley, in a position that was inconsistent with such accretions-New Mexico neither averred in its motion that there had in fact been such accretions, nor sought to amend its pleadings so as to allege either that they had taken place, or that, if so, the boundary line had been changed by reason thereof. And the question as to the location of the middle of the channel in 1850, remained, as before, the sole issue under the pleadings. \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 284]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter the Court referred the cause to a special master, with directions to make special findings, based upon the entire record, on all material questions of fact, and report the same with his recommendations. \n3\n The master, after a full hearing,4 made his report, to which both states filed exceptions. And the cause has been heard on the report and these exceptions.\n In the territory in dispute the Rio Grande flows southwardly through a plain of alluvial and sandy bottom land, composed largely of detritus, and bordered on the east and west by ranges of hills. The valley is about four miles wide at the northern end and narrows gradually to a canyon or gorge at the southern end. The river in normal times is very shallow; but at frequently recurring periods freshets caused by melting snow in the mountains and heavy rains or cloudbursts, flood and overflow the banks of the river and result in many changes in the channel both by erosions and accretions and by sudden and violent avulsions.\n At the time the bill was filed the river ran on the eastern side of the valley in the northern portion of the area in dispute, and, crossing the valley in the southern portion, ran on the western side until it reached the gorge. Neither State claims that this was the location in 1850. New Mexico, on the one hand, contends that the river then ran the entire distance from the 32d parallel to the gorge on the eastern side of the valley, near the eastern range of hills. Texas, on the other hand, contends that it crossed the parallel about three-fifths of a mile westwardly, ran farther to the west in the northern portion of the disputed area, and, crossing about midway to the western side of the valley, ran most of the way to the \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 285]\n\u00a0\n gorge near the western range of hills. That is, broadly speaking, New Mexico contends that the river then ran on the eastern side of the valley, and Texas, that it ran mainly on the western side. The distance between the two locations midway of the disputed area is about four miles.\n The master made an elaborate and thorough report in which he considered at length the contentions of the two states and the salient features of the testimony. He found, on all the evidence that the allegations of New Mexico as to the location of the Rio Grande 'as it existed in the year 1850' were not sustained, and that the river then followed in general the course claimed by Texas, and on the dates nearest to 1850 of which there was credible evidence, was located as particularly described in the report,5 and had an average width of 300 feet; but that thereafter, between 1852 and the filing of the bill, the channel in certain portions of the course, including the Country Club area, was moved eastward by reason of accretions. \n6\n And he reported that the true boundary line when the oill was filed was the middle of the channel of the river in the location occupied after such accretions, as descrived in the report,7 and recommended that this be fixed 150 feet from the east and west banks, respectively, as found by him.\n The questions presented are whether the master's finding as to the location of the river in 1850 is correct; and, if so, whether the boundary line was subsequently changed by accretions, and to what extent.\n Location of the Rio Grande in 1850.\n\n 1. \nNew Mexico while not excepting specifically to the ultimate finding of the master as to the location of the \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 286]\n\u00a0\n river in 1850, has filed various exceptions to matters leading to this general finding, by which it challenges the correctness of certain incidental statements of the master; his conclusions as to certain portions of the evidence; and the fact that he refers to certain official reports and maps which he thought might be judicially noticed, several of which he filed as exhibits to his report. Some of these exceptions are plainly immaterial. And none of them need be dealt with separately, as they are merged in the ultimate question whether, upon the competent evidence, viewed in its entirety, the master's finding as to the location of the river in 1850 is correct.\n The evidence relating to this matter is so voluminous8 that it is entirely impracticable to refer to it in any detail. And while we have considered the various contentions relating to its many phases, we can here deal with the question of its weight only in the broadest outlines.\n To establish its contention as to the location of the river New Mexico relied mainly upon the testimony of a large number of Indians and Mexicans, most of whom-with others who did not testify-had been members of different parties that had accompanied its engineers on various trips down the river between 1912 and 1914, shortly before and after the filing of the bill, for the purpose of pointing out the location of the old river; the testimony of a former registrar of the Land Office, who had known the river in 1857 and 1858 when conductor on a state route and had been employed by New Mexico to find witnesses having knowledge of the old river; and a survey of the 32d parallel made in 1859 by John H. Clark, United States commissioner, with the testimony of its engineers, surveyors and others relating thereto. \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 287]\n\u00a0\n 2. While there were various discrepancies and contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses as to the location of the old river, their evidence was to the general effect that at different times between 1850 and 1860, it ran, as they recollected, on the eastern side of the valley, near the eastern range of hills, substantially as claimed by New Mexico.\n The master, in dealing with the evidence of the Indian and Mexican witnesses, said:\n'Most of the witnesses were illiterate; they were unable to estimate distances with any degree of accuracy. ... All ... were old men, some very old, and some were only ten years of age or less at the date when they passed along the river between the years 1850 and 1860. There was much evidence that in those years the country was wild and infested with hostile Indians, ... Many of the witnesses traveled part of the time at night. From White's Ranch to Alamitos, there was but one, if any, house prior to 1857. The names given by the witnesses, therefore, to points along the river with relation to which ... they located the river, ... referred to bends, hills, bosques, esteros, cottonwood trees, etc. There was no stage coach route prior to 1857. Many of the witnesses had not traveled along the river since the Civil War; and only a few claimed to have had any continuous knowledge of the river. ... Moreover, most of the whole river plane or valley had been altered in condition since 1850-1860. In those years, it was uninhabited, uncultivated and covered in many parts near the river with thick bosques (groves or forests) of cottonwood and tornillo trees. The ... land, in 1912-1914, was considerably settled and cultivated; the town of Anthony had come into existence; there were farms, cornfields, and alfalfa fields, paved roads and a railroad, in many places where they located the bed of the old 1850 river. ... In \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 288]\n\u00a0\n many years, at the time of annual floods ... the river covered the whole valley from its western to its eastern margin. When the floods subsided, the river at times resumed its former channel, and at times it did not. ... (As) testified to by plaintiff's engineer witness, Post: 'There are old river beds or indications of old river beds in various parts of the valley. ... If I had started out to survey old river beds ... I would not be through surveying yet.' He further stated that, in surveying throughout the valley, he had seen old water courses and river beds as distinct and more distinct than that claimed by the witnesses to be the river of 1850. The river has always carried and deposited large quantities of silt, mud and other detritus. At times of flood, many old channels were filled with deposits and their presence effaced. The river valley, at places , ... has been raised in level many feet. The Santa Fe Railroad has been obliged to raise its railroad bed several times, and in doing so has, at places, excavated from the sandhills at the east. In describing the manner in which they located the river in 1912-1914, the witnesses testified that they walked along depressions, low ground, old channels, etc., which they pointed to Post and the surveyors as the bed of the river of 1850, according to their recollection; that this bed, as a rule, showed banks not more than two or three feet high; ... that for a considerable distance, at various points, the bed of the old river was then occupied by the railroad tracks, by the county road, and by the river as it flowed in 1912-1914. Many of the witnesses ... testified that, before they made their trips, the channel of the old river had been outlined by the surveyor's stakes. Several witnesses said that they followed the stakes. ... Under all the conditions outlined above, I consider it improbable that Indian and Mexican witnesses would be able to trace accurately, on \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 289]\n\u00a0\n the ground, the course of a river as it flowed over fifty to sixty years prior.'\n\n The master further found that the identification of the point from which these witnesses began their location of the old river, as the place called Alamitos where there had been prior to 1857 a camp or watering place for travelers on the east bank of the river, was 'particularly doubtful and difficult of belief,' and that the road leading up the river past Alamitos, to which they referred, did not run on the eastern side of the valley or along the eastern sand hills, as claimed, but up the valley bottom, west of the location of the river claimed by New Mexico and in a position incompatible therewith. And, after referring to the testimony of the former registrar of the Land Office, he concluded:\n'In view of all the evidence in the case, I am unable to attach great weight or credit to the testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses as to the location either of the bed or of the course of the Rio Grande as it flowed in 1850. ... I am of opinion that their memories were defective, and especially that they were mistaken as to dates, and that they confused the course of the river as they knew it in later years with their knowledge of it in earlier years. If not so mistaken ... it is apparent that many of them were testifying as to ... those periods of the year when the river was in flood and may well have been flowing along the eastern as well as the western banks. There is also evidence ... as to the existence on the east side of the remains of an old river channel of 1826, which had left sloughs or esteros at various points; also as to the existence of old ditches . ... It is probable that the river, subsiding from floods, at times ran in these sloughs, esteros, or ditches, as a minor channel or branch, and that it was thus mistaken by some witnesses for the main channel of the river.' \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 290]\n\u00a0\n 3. The survey of John H. Clark, United States commissioner, was made by him as a member of the United States and Texas Boundary Commission,9 in and after 1859, of a portion of the boundary line between Texas and the territories of the United States, including the lines of the 103d meridian and the 32d parallel between that meridian and the channel of the Rio Grande River, which then constituted part of the boundary between Texas and the Terriory of New Mexico,10 connecting on the west with the line running down the channel of the river here in dispute. In 1891 the lines of the meridian and parallel established by Clark were 'confirmed' by an Act of Congress and a Joint Resolution of the Texas Legislature as boundary lines between Texas and the Territory of New Mexico.11\n\n The significance of Clark's survey lies in its bearing upon the location of the east bank of the Rio Grande in 1859. His report shows, admittedly, that he placed at the initial point of the survey on the 32d parallel a pyramid of stone, designated as Monument No. 1, standing 600 feet \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 291]\n\u00a0\n from the east bank of the river. This monument has long since disappeared. New Mexico contended that as shown by the field notes and as re- established by its engineers with reference to other objects called for in the field notes and shown on the maps, the location of this Monument coincided with that of Station 1 on the survey of the parallel from which Clark took the bearings of various objects, and that the river bank was thereby fixed at a point 600 feet west of this Station-whose location was agreed upon-substantially as shown by the witnesses who testified to the location of the old river. On the other hand, Texas contended that as shown by the field notes and as re-established by its engineers with reference to other objects, this Monument was located at a point about 2800 feet west of Station 1, and the river bank was thereby fixed at a like distance west of the location claimed by New Mexico; and further that in 1911-1913 this Monument had been re-established at a point about 200 feet west of the location shown by its witnesses, by joint commissioners of the United States and Texas, and this re-establishment was binding upon New Mexico, irrespective of its precise accuracy.\n The basis of the latter contention is this: Before the Territory of New Mexico had been admitted as a State under the Enabling Act of 1910,12 a Constitution was adopted for the proposed State,13 which, disregarding entirely the lines of Clark's survey, declared in general terms that its boundaries ran along the 103d meridian to the 32d parallel, along that parallel to the Rio Grande, as it existed on September 9, 1850, and with the main channel of the river, as it existed on that date, to the parallel of 31 degrees and 47 minutes. Thereupon, in \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 292]\n\u00a0\n February, 1911, Congress, by a Joint Resolution 14 declared that any provision of this constitution that tended to annul or change the established boundary lines between the Territory and the State of Texas15 run by Clark in 1859 and 1860, 'shall be of no force or effect' and be construed so as not to affect or alter the Clark lines in any way, and that the ratification of these lines by the United States and the State of Texas in 1891 'shall be held and deemed a conclusive location and settlement of said boundary lines,' and the lines run and marked by monuments along the 103d meridian and the 32d parallel shall 'remain the true boundaries of Texas and New Mexico.' This Resolution further authorized the President, in conjunction with the State of Texas, to re- establish and remark the Clark boundary lines, and, for such purpose, to appoint a commissioner who, with a commissioner for the State of Texas, should re-mark the boundary between the Territory of New Mexico and Texas on the line run by Clark for the 103d meridian to the southeast \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 293]\n\u00a0\n corner of New Mexico, and thence west with the 32d parallel as determined by him to the Rio Grande; the position of the boundary lines as marked by him to be determined by his old monuments and lines where found on the ground, or otherwise by their original position as shown by parol evidence or his topographical maps and field notes.\n In August, 1911, Congress, in a Joint Resolution16 declaring that New Mexico should be admitted as a State upon compliance with certain specified conditions, specifically provided that such admission 'shall be subject to the terms and conditions of' the Joint Resolution of February, 1911. In January, 1912, New Mexico was admitted as a State. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Thereafter, the joint commissioners appointed to re-mark the Clark boundary lines-commonly called the Scott-Cockrell Commission-submitted to the President reports of their proceedings. In one of these, relating to Clark's Monument No. 1 on the 32d parallel, they stated that, on completing their field work in September, 1911, being unable after a second effort to locate this Monument from any physical facts found upon the ground or oral testimony, they had determined the approximate scale of the topographical map accompanying Clark's report, and measuring westward on the ground from his Monument No. 4 the distance to his Monument No. 1 indicated on the map, had re-established his Monument No. 1 at the point thus ascertained, and erected there a concrete monument marked to show such re-establishment. In February, 1913, the President by an Executive Order18 approved the \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 294]\n\u00a0\n reports of the commissioners, and confirmed and established their findings, conclusions and acts for the establishment and demarcation of the boundary lines between New Mexico and Texas.\n The Clark Monument No. 1, as re-established by the Scott-Cockrell Commission, is almost exactly 3,000 feet west of Station 1, and, if this is conclusive as to its original location, places the river bank in 1859 substantially in the position claimed by Texas. As to this New Mexico contended that in re-establishing the Monument the Commission had mistaken Clark's Monument No. 3 for his Monument No. 4 and consequently started the measurement from a point 3,000 feet too far to the west, and, further that as the re-establishment was not made until after New Mexico had been admitted as a State, it was not bound thereby.\n The master, in dealing with Clark's survey-as to which there was much conflicting evidence-and the re-establishment of Monument No. 1, found, as a matter of law, that New Mexico was bound by the Clark lines as re- established by the Commission and could not challenge the correctness of its acts, and that hence in locating the boundary line extending southwardly from the 32d parallel through the valley the starting point on the parallel could not be fixed east of the re-established Monument. And he further found that it was shown by the evidence, as a matter of fact, that the location of Clark's Monument No. 1 did not coincide with that of Station 1, but was at a point 2,783 feet west of that Station, 216.5 feet east of the point where the Monument had been re-established by the Commission, thereby showing that the river bank was at least 2,783 feet west of the location claimed by the witnesses for New Mexico; that the theory that the Commission had measured from Monument No. 3 instead of Monument No. 4, was without basis; and that the location of Monument No. 1, either as found by \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 295]\n\u00a0\n him or as fixed by the Commission, was utterly inconsistent with the location of the river claimed by New Mexico.\n\n 4. \nIn support of its contention as to the location of the river, Texas further relied upon various old surveys, patents and maps, and the testimony of its engineers in regard thereto, as showing the true course of the river southwardly through the valley from the point where it crossed the parallel. These documents consisted mainly of the socalled Salazar-Diaz Survey of the Rio Grande, made in 1852 by Diaz, a Mexican engineer, by order of Salazar, the Mexican member of the Joint Commission under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo; 19 a survey made in 1860 and a resurvey made in 1886, by Texas surveyors, of a Mexican grant on which Texas reissued a patent in 1886; surveys made by Texas surveyors between 1848 and 1873, several of which were bounded on the west by the river bank, on which Texas issued patents between 1860 and 1874; maps of surveys made in 1852-1853 and 1855 under the direction of the American surveyor for the Joint Boundary Commission under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo and the American member of the Joint Boundary Commission under the Gadsden Treaty, and agreed to by the joint Commissions, which showed the course of the river; and War Department maps of surveys made in 1854-1856 in the course of explorations for a railroad route to the Pacific Ocean likewise showing the course of the river. And Texas also relied upon long acquiescence by the United States before the Territory of New Mexico had been admitted as a state.\n The Salazar-Diaz Survey covered the course of the Rio Grande through all the area in dispute except in the extreme northern portion. The evidence of this Survey consisted of two copies of a document containing Diaz's memoranda and field notes. One was a copy of the \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 296]\n\u00a0\n original document in the archives of the International Boundary Commission under the Convention of 1889,20 which was authenticated by a certificate of the Mexican Commissioner. This was introduced in evidence by Texas, over the objection of New Mexico that the Commissioner had no authority to make such a certificate. \n21\n A few days later counsel for New Mexico stated that they would offer in evidence a copy of these memoranda and field notes properly certified by one of the departments of the Mexican Government. They later furnished counsel for Texas a copy certified by a government officer in the City of Mexico.22 The copy so furnished was thereafter introduced by Texas, without objection; and engineers of both States were examined and cross-examined as to their work and calculations based on this copy, concerning the reproduction of the survey on the ground. Two years later, in 1918, on the day that the taking of testimony was closed by agreement, New Mexico moved to strike out both copies from the record on the ground that they were not so authenticated as to be admissible in evidence; and introduced evidence in support of this motion for the purpose of showing that there was not in fact any original of the document in the department in the City of Mexico as they had believed when they furnished the copy to the counsel for Texas.\n We agree with the view of the master that the objections to the two copies were not well taken. The first was \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 297]\n\u00a0\n admissible upon authentication by the Mexican Boundary Commissioner having proper custody of the original. See United States v. Wiggins, 14 Pet. 334, 346, and United States v. Acosta, 1 How. 24, 26. And under all the circumstances the motion to exclude the second copy came too late, apart from any question as to its proper authentication. See Benson v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 325, 333\n, 13 S. Ct. 60.\n There was much conflict in the evidence of the engineers for New Mexico and Texas as to the location of the river as shown by the Salazar- Diaz Survey, which was described in the field notes by traverse from triangulation points; also as to the location of the Texas patent on the Mexican grant and other Texas surveys and patents. New Mexico also challenged the authenticity of the Salazar-Diaz Survey.\n\n 5. \nThe master found from the evidence:\n That the Salazar-Diaz Survey was authentic; that the course of the river as surveyed in 1852 had been reproduced by the engineers for Texas, by traverse from the triangulation points, with substantial correctness, and that even if the engineers for New Mexico were correct in certain contentions, the resultant reproduction would not place the river anywhere near the location claimed by New Mexico;\n That the boundaries of the patent issued by Texas on the Mexican grant-which extended nearly across the entire valley-except possibly the river boundary, could be substantially identified on the ground, and by far the greater part of the land patented was west of the location of the river claimed by New Mexico;\n That, although according to New Mexico's contention as to the location of the river a large part of the Texas surveys for lands lying between the 32d parallel and the Mexican grant claiming a frontage on the river, would be located in the sand-hills east of the valley, they were in fact located in the valley; \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 298]\n\u00a0\n That, although some of the Texas surveys for lands lying south of the Mexican grant and extending to the end of the valley, might, if exactly surveyed now, extend across the river and on the western bank, they claimed land lying, at least in part, west of the location of the river for which New Mexico contended, and that the western line of the lands claimed in the surveys and patents fairly corresponded, with minor variations, to the line of the river shown by the Salazar-Diaz Survey; and\n That the Salazar-Diaz Survey was corroborated by certain of the maps of the surveys made for the Joint Boundary Commissions and the War Department, and by a map accompanying Clark's survey of the 32d parallel, and that all these maps-as well as certain other maps that had not been introduced in evidence, but of which he thought judicial notice might be taken-sustained the contention of Texas as to the course of the Rio Grande in 1850 and were inconsistent with the contention of New Mexico.\n He further found that for many years prior to the admission of New Mexico as a State in 1912, surveys were made by Texas surveyors and patents issued by Texas on substantially all the land in the area in dispute;23 that the occupancy and physical possession of this land by Texas patentees and persons claiming under them, had been admitted by counsel at the hearing before him; that there was no evidence that from 1850 to 1911 the United States had issued any patents specifically covering lands east of the river as located by the Salazar-Diaz Survey, or conflicting with any of the patents issued by Texas; and \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 299]\n\u00a0\n that, for at least thirty years prior to the admission of the Territory of New Mexico as a State, the United States made no challenge of the claims to lands asserted by Texas and its citizens and, impliedly at least, recognized the practical line that had been established as the boundary between the territory and Texas.\n The master concluded on all the evidence that the allegations in New Mexico's bill as to the location and course of the Rio Grande 'as it existed in the year 1850' were not sustained, and that the river did not then flow on the eastern side of the valley as claimed by New Mexico; that its location and course in 1850 was, in general, as alleged in the cross- bill of Texas, and, in particular, that on the dates nearest to 1850 of which there was credible evidence it followed the course set forth in his report and described by reference to Clark's Monument No. 1, two Texas surveys made in 1860, a Texas survey made in 1849, and the Salazar-Diaz Survey of 1852, substantially as reproduced by the engineers for Texas; and that under the testimony the average width of the river should be estimated as 300 feet, and the middle of the channel fixed at 150 feet from the line of its east bank as shown by the Texas surveys, and 150 feet from the line of its west bank as shown by the Salazar-Diaz Survey.\n\n 6. \nWe need not determine whether any of the documents referred to by the master that had not been introduced in evidence were properly the subject of judicial notice. Be that as it may, since New Mexico had no opportunity to introduce evidence in explanation or rebuttal of them, we have not considered them in reaching our own conclusions.\n\n 7. \nUpon the whole case we are satisfied that the master's finding as to the location of the river in 1850 is substantially correct, and fixes its course as accurately as is \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 300]\n\u00a0\n possible after the lapse of more than three-quarters of a century. Whithout attempting to set out our reasons in detail, we conclude: That the testimony of the witnesses as to their recollection of the old river is far from satisfactory, and does not, in view of the other evidence in the case, sustain the burden of proof resting upon New Mexico; that the greater weight of the evidence shows that Clark's Monument No. 1 did not coincide with Station 1, but was located at least 2783 feet west thereof, substantially as re-established by the Scott-Cockrell Commission; that under the Joint Resolution of February and August, 1911, preceding and conditioning the admission of New Mexico as a State, it is bound by the re- establishment of the Monument by the Commission and cannot question its accuracy; that this necessarily extends the Clark boundary line along the 32d parallel to the east bank of the river, at a point 600 feet west of the re-established Monument; that, according to the greater weight of the evidence, the river, in 1850, or as near thereto as may now be determined, ran southwardly through the valley from the parallel, as shown by certain of the surveys, patents and maps relied on by Texas-especially the Salazar- Diaz Survey of 1852, the Texas surveys of 1849 and 1860, the maps of the surveys made in 1852-1855 for the Joint Boundary commissions, and the Clark map of 1859-on the course and in the location set forth and described in the master's report; and that this conclusion is reinforced by the tacit and long-continued acquiescence of the United States, while New Mexico was a Territory, in the claims of those holding the land in controversy under Texas surveys and patents, and the undisturbed possession of the Texas claimants. In short, we find that New Mexico has failed to sustain the burden of proof and that the master's report is in accord with the greater weight of the evidence. \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 301]\n\u00a0\n 8. New Mexico's exceptions to so much of the report as deals with the location of the river in 1850, are accordingly overruled.\n Accretions.\n Both states have filed exceptions to the master's report in reference to accretions. Texas, on the one hand, insists that he was in error in reporting as the boundary line the location occupied by the river after it had been moved eastward from its location in 1850 by accretions. New Mexico, on the other hand, insists conditionally-that is, only if its exceptions as to the location in 1850 are not sustained-that in determining the accretions in the Country Club area the master fixed the line of such accretions in an indefinite manner and not far enough to the east. We find that the contention of Texas is well taken and the conditional contention of New Mexico is therefore immaterial.\n This case is not one calling for the application of the general rule established in Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359\n, 12 S. Ct. 396; Missouri v. Nebraska, \n196 \nU.S. 23\n, 25 S. Ct. 155; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158\n, 38 S. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258 and Oklahoma v. Texas, \n260 \nU.S. 606\n, 43 S. Ct. 221, as to changes in State boundary lines caused by gradual accretions on a river boundary.\n We reach this conclusion without reference to the fact that there were no issues under the pleadings as to accretions or changes in the boundary line since 1850, and without considering the propriety of permitting amendments to the pleadings, since in any event the outcome must be the same.\n By the legislative compact created by an Act of Congress of September 9, 1850, and an Act of the Texas Legislature of November 25, 1850, the channel of the Rio Grande southwardly from its intersection with the 32d parallel was established as a boundary between Texas and the territory of the United States. By this same Act of Congress the territory of New Mexico was created, and \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 302]\n\u00a0\n by that Act, supplemented by an Act of 1854 following the Gadsden Treaty, the channel of the river between the 32d parallel and the parallel of 31 degrees 47 minutes became a boundary between the Territory of New Mexico and the State of Texas. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n New Mexico, when admitted as a State in 1912, explicitly declared in its Constitution that its boundary ran 'along said thirty-second parallel to the Rio Grande . . . as it existed on the ninth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty; thence, following the main channel of said river, as it existed on the ninth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, to the parallel of thirty-one degrees, forth- seven minutes north latitude.' This was confirmed by the United States by admitting New Mexico as a State with the line thus described as its boundary; and Texas has also affirmed the same by its pleadings in this cause. Since the Constitution defined its boundary by the channel of the river as existing in 1850, and Congress admitted it as a State with that boundary, New Mexico, manifestly, cannot now question this limitation of its boundary or assert a claim to any land lying east of the line thus limited. And it was doubtless for this reason that New Mexico alleged in its pleadings and has consistently asserted throughout this litigation that the true boundary is the channel of the river as it existed in 1850.\n The exceptions of Texas to so much of the master's report as deals with the question of accretions and fixes the boundary with reference thereto, are accordingly sustained; and the conditional exceptions of New Mexico to so much of the report as relates to accretions in the Country Club area, are overruled.\n Conclusion.\n Our conclusion on the entire case is that the boundary line between New Mexico and Texas in the area in dis- \n\n[275 U.S. 279, 303]\n\u00a0\n pute is the middle of the channel of the Rio Grande as it was located in 1850, extending southwardly from the parallel of 32 degrees north latitude to the parallel of 31 degrees 47 minutes, as found and described by the master in Section V(1) of his report; the intersection of the east bank of the river with the line of the 32d parallel to be taken at a point 600 feet west from the Clark Monument No. 1 as reestablished by the Scott- Cockrell Commission, and the middle line of the channel to be taken 150 feet from the east and west banks of the river, respectively, as found by the master.\n It results that the bill of New Mexico must be dismissed; and that under the cross-bill of Texas, the line above described must be decreed to be the boundary between the two states.\n This boundary line should now be accurately surveyed and marked by a commissioner or commissioners to be appointed by the Court, whose report shall be subject to its approval.\n The parties may submit within forty days the form of a decree to carry these conclusions into effect.\n Bill dismissed and decree directed under cross-bill. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For memorandum opinion on rehearing see 48 S.

C., for defendant Sanitary District of Chicago. \n\n[274 U.S. 488, 489]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought in this court by the state of New York against the state of Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago to enjoin them from continuing a very substantial diversion of water from Lake Michigan. The character and purpose of the diversion are shown in Sanitary District of Chicago v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405\n, 45 S. Ct. 176, and do not call for special comment now. The greater part of the bill proceeds on the theory that the diversion impairs the navigable capacity of the Great Lakes and the rivers leading from one lake to another and then to the Atlantic Ocean, and thereby obstructs and burdens commerce over these waterways to the serious injury of the plaintiff state and her people. To this part of the bill the defendants have answered, and evidence on the issues so framed has been or is being taken before a special master. The bill, in its third paragraph, attempts to set up another injury from the diversion. The paragraph has not been answered, but is assailed by a motion to strike it out. The court has heard oral argument on the motion and will now rule on it.\n The third paragraph of the bill apparently proceeds on the theory that the diversion may interfere with or prevent the use of the waters of the Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers by the plaintiff state and her citizens for the development of power. But it does not show that there is any present use of the waters for such purposes which is being or will be disturbed, nor that there is any definite project for so using them which is being or will be affected. The waters are international and their use for developing power may require the assent of the Dominion of Canada and the United States. No consent of either is shown. The suit is one for an injunction, a form or relief which must rest on an actual or presently \n\n[274 U.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n threatened interference with the rights of another. Plainly no basis for such relief is disclosed in what is said about water power development. At best the paragraph does no more than present abstract questions respecting the right of the plaintiff state and her citizens to use the waters for such purposes in the indefinite future. We are not at liberty to consider abstract questions. New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 329\n, 46 S. Ct. 122. So the motion to strike out the paragraph must be sustained. This ruling will be without prejudice, so that the plaintiff state, if later on in a position to do so, may be free to litigate the questions which the paragraph is intended to present.\n Motion to strike out paragraph III of bill of complaint sustained without prejudice. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OHIO v.

Ellis, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An ordinance, No. 76, 1918, of the city of Cincinnati, requires the licensing of pool and billiard rooms, and prohibits the issue of licenses to aliens. Plaintiff in error petitioned the Supreme Court of Ohio for a writ of mandamus commanding defendant in error, the auditor of Cincinnati, to grant him a license to conduct a billiard and pool room in that city. The petition alleged that plaintiff was a subject of the King of England, and that he had been refused a license solely because he was not a citizen. It drew in question the validity of the ordinance as violating article I of the treaty between Great Britain and the United States of July 3, 1815, 8 Stat. 228, and August 6, 1827, 8 Stat. 361 (1 Malloy, Treaties, 624, 645 ), and as denying the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[274 U.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n Defendant answered, traversing the allegation of citizenship, and asserting that billiard and pool rooms in the city of Cincinnati are meeting places of idle and vicious persons; that they are frequented by lawbreakers and other undesirable persons, and contribute to juvenile delinquency; that numerous crimes and offenses have been committed in them and consequently they require strict police surveillance; that noncitizens as a class are less familiar with the laws and customs of this country than native-born and naturalized citizens; that the maintenance of billiard and pool rooms by them is a menace to society and to the public welfare; and that the ordinance is a reasonable police regulation passed in the interest of and for the benefit of the public.\n On plaintiff's motion, the Supreme Court of Ohio gave judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the petition. 113 Ohio St. 347, 149 N. E. 194. In an earlier case. State ex rel. Balli v. Carrel, 99 Ohio St. 285, 124 N. E. 129, it had held that the ordinance in question did not deny any rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution. The case comes here on writ of error, Judicial Code,  237, as amended (Comp. St.  1214), the plaintiff renewing here the contentions made below.\n At the outset defendant insists that plaintiff has not established that he is entitled to the benefit of the treaty since his allegation of citizenship is not admitted on the face of the pleadings. But the Supreme Court of Ohio has construed the pleadings as sufficient to draw in question the validity of the ordinance under the treaty. Hence we need not concern ourselves with those refinements of the local law of pleading which, it is said, enable defendant to justify his refusal to issue a license because of plaintiff's assertion of British citizenship, and at the same time deny that plaintiff has established citizenship entitling him to the protection of the treaty.

The clause suggested as pertinent reads:\n'And, generally, the merchants and traders of each nation, respectively, shall enjoy the most complete protection and security for their commerce.'\n\n Even if assumed, as argued, that the proprietor of a pool room may for some purposes be regarded as engaged in a trade, the word being used as synonymous with occupation or employment, he does not engage in commerce within the meaning of a treaty which merely extends to 'merchants and traders' 'protection and security for their commerce.' See Bobe v. Lloyds (C. C. A.) 10 F. (2d) 730, 734. It would be an extravagant applica- \n\n[274 U.S. 392, 396]\n\u00a0\n tion of the language quoted to say that it could be extended to include the owner of a place of amusement who does not necessarily buy, sell or exchange merchandise or otherwise participate in commerce.\n Asakura v. Seattle, \n265 \nU.S. 332\n, 44 S. Ct. 515, relied on by plaintiff, does not support his contention. It was there held that the treaty with Japan of February 21, 1911, 37 Stat. 1504, was violated by a municipal ordinance prohibiting the granting of pawnbrokers' licenses to noncitizens. That treaty secured to the citizens of Japan the right to 'enter, travel and reside' in the United States and 'to carry on trade, wholesale and retail ... and generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade.' This language, which is plainly broader in some respects than that of the British treaty, was held to embrace within its protection a Japanese pawnbroker whose business, in contrast to that of plaintiff, necessarily involved the lending of money on the security of merchandise and the sale of merchandise when necessary to realize on the security.\n The objections to the constitutionality of the ordinance are not persuasive. Although the Fourteenth Amendment has been held to prohibit plainly irrational discrimination against aliens (Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n, 6 S. Ct. 1064; Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283; In re Tiburcio Parrott (C. C.) 1 F. 481; In re Ah Chong (C. C.) 2 F. 733; Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 5 Sawy. 552, Fed. Cas. No. 6,546; Wong Wai v. Williamson (C. C.) 103 F. 1; Fraser v. McConway & Torley Co. (C. C.) 82 F. 257), it does not follow that alien race and allegiance may not bear in some instances such a relation to a legitimate object of legislation as to be made the basis of a permitted classification (Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138\n, 34 S. Ct. 281; Crane v. New York, \n239 \nU.S. 195, 198\n, 36 S. Ct. 85; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n, 44 S. Ct. 15; Porterfield v.

California, \n268 \nU.S. 258\n, 45 S. Ct. 490). Cf. McCready v. Virginia, \n94 U.S. 391\n.\n The admitted allegations of the answer set up the harmful and vicious tendencies of public billiard and pool rooms, of which this court took judicial notice in Murphy v. California, \n225 \nU.S. 623\n, 32 S. Ct. 697, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 153. The regulation or even prohibition of the business is not forbidden. Murphy v. California, supra. The present regulation presupposes that aliens in Cincinnati are not as well qualified as citizens to engage in this business. It is not necessary that we be satisfied that this premise is well founded in experience. We cannot say that the city council gave unreasonable weight to the view admitted by the pleadings that the associations, experiences and interests of members of the class disqualified the class as a whole from conducting a business of dangerous tendencies.\n It is enough for present purposes that the ordinance, in the light of facts admitted or generally assumed, does not preclude the possibility of a rational basis for the legislative judgment and that we have no such knowledge of local conditions as would enable us to say that it is clearly wrong. Ft. Smith Light & Traction Co. v. Board of Improvement, \n274 \nU.S. 387\n, 47 S. Ct. 595, decided this day.\n Some latitude must be allowed for the legislative appraisement of local conditions (Patsone v. Pennsylvania, supra, 144 (34 S. Ct. 281); Adams v. Milwaukee, \n228 \nU.S. 572, 583\n, 33 S. Ct. 610), and for the legislative choice of methods for controlling an apprehended evil. It was competent for the city to make such a choice, not shown to be irrational, by excluding from the conduct of a dubious business an entire class rather than its objectionable members selected by more empirical methods.

STIMSON LUMBER CO. v. KUYKENDALL(1927)\nNo. 66\nArgued: October 24, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 207, 208]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. A. Reynolds, of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. H. C. Brodie, of Olympia, Wash., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 17, 1924, the department of public works, after hearing upon a complaint of relator, made an order which declared that a specified tariff rate for towing logs from Clifton to Lake Union in Seattle was 'just, fair, and no more than sufficient,' and directed the Shively Towboat Company to collect from relator charges based on that rate for towing done between March 1, and May 1, 1924. He superior court affirmed the order. \n\n[275 U.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n Relator appealed to the Supreme Court, and there challenged the validity of the order and statutory provisions under which it was made, on the ground that they are repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held them valid and affirmed the judgment. 137 Wash. 602, 243 P. 834.\n Relator got logs near Clifton and had a mill for the manufacture of lumber at Lake Union. The distance by water is about 100 miles. The Northwestern Towboat Owners' Association, in accordance with an order of the department, filed a tariff effective September 30, 1923. The tariff included maps showing Puget Sound and adjacent waters divided into zones; it named rates for towing between all points thereon; it contained a list of 50 operators including the Shively Company, that concurred therein; it specified rates to be charged for towing ships, scows, and logs between zones, and rates for many other services to be rendered by tugs. The rate specified for towing logs from the zone including Clifton to that including Lake Union was 94 cents per thousand feet. A note declared 'all tows at owner's risk,' and stated that the tariff was intended to name rates for all services on Puget Sound and adjacent waters. Commencing March 1, 1924, the Shively Company towed logs for relator from Clifton to Lake Union, and, in accordance with an agreement between them, charged $16. 50 per section. Either could terminate the arrangement at will. A supplement to the tariff, effective May 1, 1924, named $25 per section as the rate from Clifton to Lake Union. That rate was the same or a little less than 94 cents per thousand. Relator's logs were towed by the section, and the last-mentioned rate was put in so that it would not have to scale the logs in order to ascertain the charges. June 6, 1924, relator complained to the department asserting, among other \n\n[275 U.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n things not here material, that the business of towing logs was not affected with a public interest or within the jurisdiction of the department. Then followed the hearing, order, and judgments above referred to.\n The statutes of Washington declare that towboats operated 'for the public use in the conveyance of persons or property for hire over and upon the waters within this state' are common carriers. They require that charges made by common carriers 'shall be just, fair, reasonable, and sufficient'; that the carriers file with the department of public works schedules showing the rates to be charged; that the names of carriers who are parties to joint tariffs shall be specified therein; and that each party, other than the one filing the tariff, shall file such evidence of concurrence as may be required. And the statutes make it unlawful for any such carrier to collect different compensation than that provided for in the schedules, and prohibit it from charging any person a greater or less compensation than that collected from others for like contemporaneous service. Other provisions authorize the department to prescribe and enforce the rates to be charged by all common carriers including towboats. Remington's Complied Statutes,  10344 et seq.\n Relator does not here contest the reasonableness of the rate; it does not question the power of the state or the authority of the department to prescribe and enforce reasonable rates for transportation by common carriers on Puget Sound and adjacent waters in Washinton; it does not contend that, if the Shively Company was a common carrier of logs by towboat, the agreement for transportation of relator's logs for less than the tariff would be valid, or that the order complained of would not be valid. It is established that, consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a \n\n[275 U.S. 207, 211]\n\u00a0\n private carrier cannot be converted into a common carrier by mere legislative command. Frost Trucking Co. v. R. R. Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583, 592\n, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457; Michigan Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 577\n, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105\n\n\n It cannot reasonably be said that operators of towboats may not become common carriers in the towing of logs in Puget Sound and adjacent waters. The manufacture of lumber at mills located by those waters is one of the principal industries of the State. The forests are tributary to the Sound and waters connecting with it. Large quantities of logs are floated from the forests to the mills. Towboats are commonly used for that purpose. In all essential particulars that service is like the carriage of freight in vessels. The reasons for rate regulation are the same in one case as in the other. Within settled principles, one who undertakes for hire to transport from place to place the property of others who may choose to employ him is a common carrier. Propeller Niagara v. Cordes et al., 21 How. 7, 22. The tariff filed by the Northwestern Towboat Owners' Association shows that 50 owners held themselves out as engaged in the business of common carriers, including the towing of logs; and, for that purpose, they devote their towboats to the use of the public. They are common carriers, not because of legislative fiat, but by reason of the character of the business they carry on. The statute does not attempt to make all towboats common carriers. It application is limited to those operated in the public use for hire. The rule that towboats not having exclusive control of vessels towed are not to be held to the strict liability of common carriers1 does not affect the question under consideration. And the notice in the tariff that all tows are at owner's risk is immaterial. 'A common carrier is such by virtue of his occupation, not by \n\n[275 U.S. 207, 212]\n\u00a0\n virtue of the responsibilities under which he rests.' Liverpool Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 440\n, 9 S. Ct. 469, 471 (32 L. Ed. 788). The Shively Company stands the same as the other parties to the tariff. It was engaged in the general towboat business; it towed logs for others as well as for relator; it held itself out as a common carrier in that line of business and by the tariff gave public notice to that effect. Its towboat was devoted to the public use, among other things, for the transportation of logs. By its own choice, it became a common carrier. Terminal Taxicab Co. v. District of Columbia, \n241 \nU.S. 252\n, 36 S. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765. The State had power to regulate its charges. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n. The purpose of the regulations complained of is to establish reasonable rates to be charged, and to prevent unjust discrimination, by public carriers. Such regulations would be of little value if the state law permitted the shippers by private contract with public carriers to obtain the towing of their logs for less than the prescribed rates. Relator was free to have its logs towed by a private carrier for such compensation as might be agreed and without regard to the rates established by the department. The order was not aimed at any such transaction. It being conceded here that the charges in question are not excessive, the relator's contention that the state rate regulation deprives it of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment has no foundation.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Steamer Webb, 14 Wall. 406, 414; The Margaret, \n94 U.S. 494\n, 496; Transportation Line v.

Ct. 342.\n The material allegations are: Panama City and St. Andrews are adjoining municipalities in Florida. These were rival cities, whose resources were timber lands and fisheries awaiting development. A. B. Steele was a stockholder in the Atlanta & St. Andrews Bay Railway Company, which operated a railroad between Dothan, Ala., and Panama City. He was interested in a lumber company, which was a large stockholder in the railway company. Drummond owned much land in St. Andrews, and some of it was on St. Andrews Bay. Steele desired to extend the railway from Panama City to the Bay. Drummond was willing to co-operate with him to that end. His purpose was to enhance the value of his lands by procuring railroad facilities for St. Andrews equal to those at Panama City. Steele agreed to procure a charter for a railway company; to convey to it a right of way within Panama City; to furnish all the iron and steel for track material; to deliver the cross-ties which were to be furnished by Drummond; and to procure the proposed company, in conjunction with the Atlanta & St. Andrews Bay Railway Company, to operate regular trains over \n\n[275 U.S. 199, 204]\n\u00a0\n the two roads from Dothan to St. Andrews, giving the latter the same service as that had by Panama City. Drummond agreed to obtain and convey to the new company a right of way within St. Andrews, 'and to procure necessary franchises and ordinances from the town of St. Andrews'; to pay the cost of clearing and grading the whole line, furnish and lay all ties, build necessary trestles and culverts, lay the rails, and put in a wye; and to cause a tract of terminal land fronting on St. Andrews Bay to be conveyed to the new company. Steele procured the charter, organized a company, and became owner of all its stock; and, at his instance, Drummond conveyed the completed railroad to the new company. Steele caused the railway service to be furnished as agreed until August, 1921, when operation ceased. Service at Pannama City continued. Except for the covenant in respect of service for St. Andrews, Drummond would not have made the contract. This was known to Steele; and it is alleged that to perform on his part, Drummond expended $53,178.11, and that, by reason of Steele's failure to cause continuous service, Drummond's expenditures became a total loss.\n Petitioner contends that the contract is illegal and void because respondent's undertaking to procure the passage of the ordinances was contrary to public policy. In Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 16 How. 314, Mr. Justice Grier, delivering the opinion of the Court, said (page 334):\n'It is an undoubted principle of the common law that it will not lend its aid to enforce a contract to do an act that is illegal, or which is inconsistent with sound morals or public policy, or which tends to corrupt or contaminate, by improper influences, the integrity of our social or political institutions. ... Public policy and sound morality do therefore imperatively require that courts should put the stamp of their \n\n[275 U.S. 199, 205]\n\u00a0\n disapprobation on every act, and pronounce void every contract the ultimate or probable tendency of which would be to sully the purity or mislead the judgments of those to whom the high trust of legislation is confided.'\n\n And then, to make distinction between legitimate action and the contract condemned in that case, it is said:\n'All persons whose interests may in any way be affected by any public or private act of the Legislature have an undoubted right to urge their claims and arguments, either in person or by counsel professing to act for them, before legislative committees, as well as in courts of justice.'\n\n While the principle is readily understood, its right application is often a matter of much delicacy. It is only because of the dominant public interest that one, who has had the benefit of performance by the other party, is permitted to avoid his own obligation on the plea that the agreement is illegal. And it is a matter of great public concern that freedom of contract be not lightly interfered with. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Ry. v. Voigt, \n176 \nU.S. 498, 505\n, 20 S. Ct. 385. The meaning of the phrase 'public policy' is vague and variable; there are no fixed rules by which to determine what it is. It has never been defined by the courts, but has been left loose and free of definition, in the same manner as fraud. 1 Story on Contracts (5th Ed.)  675; Pope Mfg. Co. v. Gormully, \n144 \nU.S. 224, 233\n, 12 S. Ct. 632. It is only in clear cases that contracts will be held void. The principle must be cautiously applied to guard against confusion and injustice.

Detriment to the public interest will not be presumed, where nothing sinister or improper is done or contemplated. Valdes v. \n\n[275 U.S. 199, 206]\n\u00a0\n Larrinaga, \n233 \nU.S. 705, 709\n, 34 S. Ct. 750. The contract here under consideration is to be distinguished from those dealt with in Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45, Trist v. Child, 21 Wall. 441, Meguire v. Corwine, \n101 U.S. 108\n, Oscanyan v. Arms Co., \n103 U.S. 261\n, Hazelton v. Sheckels, \n202 \nU.S. 71\n, 26 S. Ct. 567, 6 Ann. Cas. 217, and Crocker v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 74\n, 36 S. Ct. 245. The claims there considered were under contracts requiring or contemplating the obtaining of legislative or executive action as a matter of favor by means of personal influence, solicitation, and the like, or by other improper or corrupt means.\n But this case is different. Drummond was not employed by Steele or by the railroad company to secure the passage of the ordi nances. He was interested as an owner of property. Neither the contract, nor what was done, suggests that the location or construction of the proposed line was not a legitimate enterprise undertaken for the public good, or that anything improper was contemplated as a means to secure the passage of the ordinances. Drummond's object was to obtain the railway service; and, for that purpose, he expended a large sum. The mere fact that he owned property that might be favorably affected does not tend to discredit him, or to make evil his undertaking to obtain the ordinances. His interest in having the railroad extended into St. Andrews gave him the right in every legitimate way to urge the passage of appropriate ordinances. There is nothing that tends to indicate that in the promotion or passage of them there was any departure from the best standards of duty to the public. The contention that Drummond's agreement to secure their passage was contrary to public policy cannot be sustained. Cole v. Brown-Hurley Co., 139 Iowa, 487, 117 N. W. 746, 18 L. R. A. (N.

St. Rep. 928; Noble v. Mead-Morrison Mfg. Co., 237 Mass. 5, 21, 129 N. E. 669.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 199, 207]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner also contends that the contract contravened public policy and is void because Steele agreed to procure the specified service to be given St. Andrews. The argument is that, in order to keep his covenant, he might be tempted to use his vote to obtain corporate action of the railroad companies that was not to the best interest of their stockholders. But the contention has no foundation of fact on which to rest. As shown above, it must be clearly established that public policy would be violated before Steele may raise that objection to prevent enforcement of the contract. The allegations do not indicate that the carriers were not in duty bound to give equality of service to these adjoining and competing towns; and, for aught that appears, their interests would have been served best by continuing operation over the new line. It does not appear that the giving of the service would have resulted to the disadvantage of either company or its shareholders. Steele took all the stock of the new company; it does not appear that it ever had any other stockholders. The facts alleged fail to show that performance would tend to constitute a fraud upon the old company or its stockholders or tend in any degree to injure them. It would be mere speculation to say that the transaction described has any tendency to bring Steele's personal interest into conflict with his duty as a voting shareholder.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWEDISH STATE RAILWAYS v.

This is the appropriate procedure, under the state law, for compelling a return to the taxpayer of taxes improperly collected. Section 162, Carroll's Ky. Stat. 1922; Craig, Auditor, v. Renaker, 201 Ky. 576, 257 S. W. 1018. \n\n[273 U.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n The trial court gave judgment for plaintiff which was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. 208 Ky. 64, 270 S. W. 478. The case comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237 (Comp. St.  1214).\n Plaintiff is engaged in producing crude oil in Kentucky and delivering it to pipe lines for transportation to points outside of the state. The tax in question was levied for the period from March, 1922, to February, 1924, pursuant to the Act of March 29, 1918, c. 122 (Acts 1918, p. 540), which requires those 'producing crude petroleum oil' in the state to pay 'in lieu of all other taxes on the wells producing said crude petroleum' an annual tax 'of one per centum of the market value of all crude petroleum so produced.' Section 3 of the act provides:\n'The tax hereby provided for shall be imposed and attach when the crude petroleum is first transported from the tanks or other receptacles located at the place of production.'\n\n By other sections those engaged in the business of transporting oil are required to report to the tax officials, the amount of oil transported by them and to pay the tax, and they are authorized to collect the amount of the tax from the producer, either in money or crude petroleum. This act, as stated in its title, is an amendment and re-enactment of the Act of May 2, 1917, c. 9 (Acts 1917, p. 40), which similary required oil producers to pay in lieu of other taxes a 'license' or 'franchise' tax for the 'right or privilege of engaging in such business,' within the state. The producers themselves, under the 1917 act, were required to pay to tax and to report the amount of the oil produced to the state tax commission on the 1st day of July of that year and at the end of each succeeding three months. The taxpayer was entitled, under the 1917 act, to notice of the valuation placed by the commission upon the oil produced and had 10 days from the time of receiving notice to go before the commission and contest the valuation. He was privileged to \n\n[273 U.S. 407, 410]\n\u00a0\n introduce evidence, and the commission was authorized, after a hearing, to change the value set for taxation purposes upon the oil produced.\n This act, as amended, was construed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, in an earlier decision. Raydure v. Board of Supervisors, 183 Ky. 84, 209 S. W. 19. It there held that the Legislature had no power under sections 171 and 172 of the state Constitution to substitute the production tax authorized by the act of the 1917 as amended by the act of 1918 for the ad valorem method of taxing oil producing property required by the Constitution, nor to exempt such property from ad valorem taxation. Following this decision, the wells and oil producing property of plaintiff and others have been subjected to state, county, and local ad valorem taxes in addition to the production tax imposed upon plaintiff.\n Plaintiff in the state court drew in question the validity of the act of 1918 as thus construed under the Kentucky Constitution. It contended that if construed as imposing a license tax, the statute was unconstitutional in attemption to substitute an occupation for the ad valorem tax required by section 172 of the state Constitution. The main contention however was that the tax in substance was a property and not a license tax and hence invalid under section 171 of the state Constitution requiring uniform taxation since oil properties were subject to two property taxes whereas other classes of property were subject to but one. These contentions translated into terms of the federal Constitution were urged below and renewed here.\n It is argued (a) that the act of 1918 as construed and administered by the state authorities imposes double taxation upon the plaintiff not put on other classes of property, thus denying the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; (b) that it authorizes a tax upon interstate shipments, thus interfering with interstate commerce in violation of article 1, \n\n[273 U.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n s 8, of the federal Constitution; (c) that the tax is assessed and collected without notice and without opportunity to the taxpayer to be heard, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The court below upheld the tax as a license or production tax valid under the laws and Constitution of Kentucky, notwithstanding the imposition of a separate ad valorem tax upon the oil producing lands or leases. It disposed of the objections to the tax under the federal Constitution, saying:\n'Each of these criticisms is leveled at, and can affect only, the amendment of 1918, and there is, and could be, no criticism of the title of the original act passed in 1917, or any claim that it imposed any burden upon interstate commerce, or that it did not afford the taxpayer ample opportunity to be heard before the tax attached.\n\n'The original act imposes, just as does the amendment, a graduated occupational tax, measured by the amount of business done by each and every oil producer in the state. The amendment is simply a re- enactment of the original act, with the latter's administrative features so changed as to make the collection of the tax both more certain and less burdensome upon the taxpayer and the assessing and collecting officials. If any or all of the above contentions are sound, the amendment would be destroyed, but this would leave the original act in force, and unamended. Precisely the same tax would have been collected from oil producers in either event.'\n\n The court also pointed out that as this is a proceeding by a taxpayer for a refund of taxes under a statute which permits the refund only if the taxes paid were not due, there could in any event be no recovery by the plaintiff since the tax, if not due under the act of 1918, was due and payable under the act of 1917\n\n\n As the case is brought here from a state court, the construction put by the court below upon the statutes \n\n[273 U.S. 407, 412]\n\u00a0\n and Constitution of its own state is not open to review here. Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 119\n, 30 S. Ct. 496; Brown- Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 569\n, 30 S. Ct. 578. Since the Kentucky Court of Appeals has held that the plaintiff is not entitled under the state law to the relief prayed even if the act of 1918 be deemed invalid, no questions as to the validity of that act under the federal Constitution is presented for decision on this record.\n But plaintiff argues that this determination of the state court presupposes the validity under the federal Constitution of the act of 1917, which has the same vice as the later act. It is contended, as it was of the act of 1918, that the one per cent. production tax imposed is in effect a property tax. Since to Constitution of Kentucky as construed in Raydure v. Board of Supervisors, supra, does not admit of the substitution of a production tax for an ad valorem tax and requires the latter to be levied in addition to the production tax, there is therefore double taxation not imposed on other classes of property and hence a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We are unable to distinguish the act of 1917 in its constitutional aspects from the statute of Kentucky imposing a license tax at the rate 1 1\/4 cents per gallon upon those engaged in the business or occupation of rectifying or blending spirits, considered by this court in Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, supra. There the tax imposed was assailed on the ground that it was a property tax not assessed upon similar classes of property whether produced within or without the state, and that its imposition resulted in a denial of the equal protection of the laws. But this court, accepting the state court's interpretation of the tax as a license tax, upheld the statute as based upon a classification which was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable, saying that the reasonableness of the classification was the ultimate ques- \n\n[273 U.S. 407, 413]\n\u00a0\n tion to be determined whether the tax be regarded as a license or a property tax (page 571 (30 S. Ct. 578)). See, also, Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, supra, where an occupation tax upon wholesale dealers in coal and other mineral oils was upheld despite the fact that wholesale dealers in other commodities were not similarly taxed.\n Without a labored analysis of the nature of the taxing measure, we see no reason for not accepting the interpretation of the state court that this statute authorizes a license tax to which there can be no serious constitutional objection. Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 481\n, 42 S. Ct. 375; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 649\n, 41 S. Ct. 606; cf. Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122\n, 41 S. Ct. 43. But even if regarded as a property tax, it is imposed alike upon all crude oil produced within the state and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the classification is so palpably arbitrary or unreasonable as to render it invalid. Unlike the state Constitution (Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288\n, 41 S. Ct. 272; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R., \n244 \nU.S. 499\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88), the Fourteenth Amendment does not require uniformity of taxation (Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 105), nor forbid double taxation (St. Louis, S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 367\n, 368 S., 35 S. Ct. 99; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 58\n, 40 S. Ct. 221; Fort Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532, 533\n, 40 S. Ct. 304; cf.

Ct. 558; Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99, 109\n, 42 S. Ct. 15). It is sufficient, as stated, that there be some adequate or reasonable basis for the classification. Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 733\n, 23 S. Ct. 401; Watson v. State Comptroller, supra, 124, 125; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 540\n, 40 S. Ct. 2; Northwestern Life Ins. Co. v.

After leaving Messina the vessel put in at Gibraltar, Lisbon, Ponta Delgada (the Azores), North Sydney (Nova Scotia), and Halifax. While passing between the last-named ports, through negligent navigation, she struck a reef or submerged object; water filled her forward compartment and respondents' goods were so damaged that they refused acceptance at destination. The causes were heard upon the same record and present identical questions. In the District Court petitioner prevailed; but the Circuit Court of Appeals thought otherwise, and entered judgments for the damages sustained. 300 F. 5.\n The petition for certiorari alleges that the causes involve three questions:\n\n\n (1)\n When in normal condition citrate of lime contains 64 per centum of citric acid; the cargo offered for delivery at New York contained 60 per centum of citric acid. Was it in sound condition?\n\n\n (2)\n Having regard to the bills of lading, did the Willdomino deviate when she went to North Sydney?\n\n\n (3)\n Must there be causal connection between the lack of due diligence to make a vessel seaworthy and the accident from which damage results in order to deprive the \n\n[272 U.S. 718, 725]\n\u00a0\n vessel of the exemptions granted by section 3 of the Harter Act? 1\n We confine our consideration to the points specified by the petition and agree with the conclusions of the Circuit Court of Appeals concerning the essential facts, although they are radically different from those of the trial court. It is unnecessary now to discuss the evidence-that was adequately done below.\n The first of the above-stated questions has not been pressed here and is either abandoned or inconsequential.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, we think, rightly held that the Willdomino made an inexcusable deviation from the permitted course when she went to North Sydney. Consequently she became liable as an insurer for any damage suffered by the cargo. St. Johns Corp. v. Companhia Geral, etc., \n263 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 44 S. Ct. 30; The Citta di Messina (D. C.) 169 F. 472, 474, 475; The Sarnia (C. C. A.) 278 F. 459.\n Except as to inserted name of the consignee and number of casks the printed bills of lading were identical. They acknowledge receipt of '... casks citrate of lime' 'for shipment, in apparent good order and condition, from Ferd. Baller & Co., to be transported by the good \n\n[272 U.S. 718, 726]\n\u00a0\n steamship Willdomino to New York, with liberty to call at intermediate ports or any port or ports in or out of the customary route in any order, to receive and discharge coal, cargo, passengers, and for any other purposes.' And they provide: 'The ship has liberty of filling up and\/or bunkering at any port or ports in or out of the way.' 'Filling up only in ports on the westwards of New York,' is written at the bottom of each bill, and all agree that of therein really means to.\n The Willdomino left Messina with 569 tons of coal-not sufficient under any circumstances to carry her to New York. At Gibraltar, a customary coaling port, she took on 400 tons and left there for Lisbon with 756 tons in her bunkers. From Lisbon she cleared for New York-2,905 miles away-with but 651 tons, an inadequate amount. When five days out from Lisbon an accident befell the high-pressure turbine and she put into Ponta Delgada for repairs. Finding that port not properly equipped therefor, the master decided to proceed on the low-pressure turbine alone. She took on 250 tons of coal and cleared for New York-2,290 miles-with 629 tons on board. This was grossly inadequate for that distance, as her officers knew. After proceeding five or six days toward New York, it became manifest that there was not enough coal to make that port, and thereupon she radically changed her course and proceeded to North Sydney, where she arrived with 62 tons.\n It is clear enough that for some reason not quite definitely disclosed the officers of the vessel under direction of the owners, while realizing that there was not enough coal on board for such voyage, wished to create the impression that she left Ponta Delgada, bound directly \n\n[272 U.S. 718, 727]\n\u00a0\n for New York, when in truth they intended to take her to North Sydney under pretense of an emergency.\n In such circumstances by proceeding for five or six days in the direction of New York the vessel deviated from any permissible course to North Sydney, even if it be true, as her counsel now maintain, that she had the right to go and intended to proceed to the latter port from Ponta Delgada.\n If, on the other hand, the vessel started from Ponta Delgada with the intention of going to New York, the only emergency claimed to justify departure from the ordinary course and procedure to North Sydney arose from willful failure to take on sufficient coal.\n An emergency sufficient to excuse a departure cannot arise out of circumstances deliberately planned nor from gross negligence.\n Whether the intention was to proceed directly from Ponta Delgada to New York, as counsel for the petitioner are said to have maintained below, or to North Sydney, as they now insist, there was inexcusable departure.\n'In the law maritime a deviation is defined as a 'voluntary departure without necessity, or any reasonable cause, from the regular and usual course of the ship insured.\" Constable v. National Steamship Co., \n154 \nU.S. 51, 66\n, 14 S. Ct. 1062, 1068 (38 L. Ed. 903). 'The voyage must be prosecuted without unnecessary delay or deviation. The shipowner's undertaking is that he will be diligent in carrying the goods on the agreed voyage and will do so directly without any unnecessary deviation.' Carver on Carriage of Goods by Sea (6th Ed.) 393.\n\n Nothing in the present bills of lading suggests that the vessel might wander about the sea, heading first for one port, and then without adequate reason for another. If the Willdomino had the privilege of going from Ponta Delgada to North Sydney and intended so to do, it was \n\n[272 U.S. 718, 728]\n\u00a0\n her duty to take the ordinary course. This she did not do.\n What has been said of the second question renders it unnecessary to discuss the third.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 3.

The Pennsylvania Railroad is a corporation of Pennsylvania, and a common carrier engaged in Ohio, and carried freight for the Timken Company. The Timken Company sued the Pennsylvania Company, averring the following facts:\n On April 10, 1920, the yard employees of the Pennsylvania Company struck. That company notified the Timken Company that it would be unable to switch freight cars for it from the Pennsylvania's interchange tracks to the customary delivery of the Timken plant at Canton, Ohio. The Pennsylvania Company then provided the Timken Company with a yard locomotive, and from April 13, 1920, to about September 30, 1920, the Timken Company, with the knowledge and consent, and at the request, of the Pennsylvania Company, did the switching service itself. The Pennsylvania Company made to the Timken Company its customary charges for such switching service at its regular freight rates, which the Timken Company paid. During that period the Timken Company switched 1,640 freight cars for the Pennsylvania Company, the \n\n[274 U.S. 181, 184]\n\u00a0\n reasonable value of which service was $6,534.61. This amount was included in the line haul freight charges paid by the Timken Company to the Pennsylvania Company. The Pennsylvania Company was thus unjustly enriched in the amount above stated, and the Pennsylvania Company owed to the Timken Company the reasonable value of the service as stated.\n The suit of the Timken Company was brought in the common pleas court of Cuyahoga county, Ohio, and removed by the Pennsylvania Company on the ground of diverse citizenship to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In that court the Pennsylvania Company filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, on the grounds:\n\n\n (a)\n That the matters complained of in the plaintiff's petition essentially involved the making of a rate, as to which the District Court had no power.\n\n\n (b)\n The subject affected the reasonableness of rates and the reasonableness of a practice in interstate commerce, which were administrative questions, confided primarily to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and there was no allegation in the plaintiff's petition that the Interstate Commerce Commission had prescribed any rule, rate, or practice which would regulate, control, or govern the rights or obligations of the plaintiff and defendant in the matter complained of.\n\n\n (c)\n That to compensate the plaintiff for the expense of the switching service set forth in plaintiff's petition would be tantamount to giving him a rebate, contrary to law.\n The motion to dismiss was sustained by the District Court on the ground that the question presented by the plaintiff's petition was an administrative and not a judicial question, and that exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the matters complained of was vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission. The District Court \n\n[274 U.S. 181, 185]\n\u00a0\n therefore dismissed the petition solely for want of jurisdiction, and under the provisions of section 238 of the Judicial Code of the United States (Comp. St.  1215) as it stood at the time, January 30, 1925:\n'Appeals and writs of error may be taken from the District Courts, including the United States District Court for Hawaii, ... direct to the Supreme Court in the following cases: In any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, in which case the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision, ...'\n\n -made the following certificate:\n'This court of its final order dismissed the suit solely for want of jurisdiction.\n\n'This certificate is made conformably to Judicial Code,  238, and the opinion filed herein is made a part of the record and will be certified and sent up as a part of the proceedings, together with his certificate.'\n\n Thereupon a writ of error from this court to the District Court was allowed by the District Judge.\n When the case was argued here in open court, this court ordered the dismissal of the writ of error as above, for the reason that the question of jurisdiction passed on by the District Court in this case was not such a question as was covered by section 238. As interpreted by repeated decisions of the court, such a question is in issue only when the District Court's power to hear and determine the cause as defined and limited by the Constitution or statutes of the United States is in controversy, and where a District Court is vested with jurisdiction of a cause, as where diversity of citizenship exists, and the matter in controversy is of the requisite value, the question whether it has the power to afford the plaintiff a particular remedy does not present a jurisdictional issue.

The real question was whether, in the absence of an administrative decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the plaintiff had a cause of action. See Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, 42 S. Ct. 477. It went to the merits, and not to the jurisdiction, and therefore this court had no jurisdiction by writ of error under section 238 to consider the case.\n The issue now made is whether this court made the proper disposition of the cause by dismissing it, in view of the amendment by Act of Congress of September 14, 1922, to section 238 of the Judicial Code, called section 238a, c. 305 (42 Stat. 837 (Comp. St.  1215a)), as follows:\n'If an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, any circuit court of appeals in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to or issued out of the Supreme Court; or if an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, the Supreme Court in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to, or issued out of, a Circuit Court of Appeals, such appeal or writ of error shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court, which shall thereupon be possessed of the same and shall proceed to the determination thereof, with the same force and effect as if such appeal or writ of error had been duly taken to, or issued out of, the court to which it is so transferred.'\n\n There is no doubt that under this section, if it applies to the present case, the motion to dismiss should not have been granted as it was, but the case should have been transferred to the Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the issue on the merits as to the cause of action set up by the Timken Company in its petition. \n\n[274 U.S. 181, 187]\n\u00a0\n The motion now made to set aside the dismissal and enter an order of transfer is resisted by the attorneys for the Pennsylvania Company, on the ground that section 238a does not now apply to the present case. This suit was filed in the common pleas court of Cuyahoga county on May 31, 1924, and was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio June 30, 1924, and upon the defendant's motion was dismissed by the District Court for lack of jurisdiction; the judge's certificate to that effect being filed January 30, 1925. The writ of error was allowed by the District Court on April 6, 1925, was issued on that date, and served upon the defendant in error April 18, 1925-all before the taking effect of the Act of February, 1925, on May 13, 1925. The return on the writ of error was transmitted by the clerk of the District Court on July 3, 1925; the transcript of record being filed on July 13, 1925\n\n\n The Act of September 14, 1922,  238a, was expressly repealed by the Act of February 13, 1925,  13 (43 Stat. at Large, 942). Section 14 provides that the act 'shall take effect after three months after its approval; but it shall not affect cases then pending in the Supreme Court, nor shall it affect the right to a review, or the mode or time for exercising the same, as respects any judgment or decree entered prior to the date when it takes effect.' The defendant contends that section 14 cannot be construed to continue the effect of section 238a of the Act of September 22, 1922, because section 14 only saves cases then pending in the Supreme Court; that as this court has now found it had no jurisdiction of the writ of error issued by this court to the District Court, it cannot be said that it was a case pending in this court, and therefore did not come within the saving clause; and that the order dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction must stand. We think that this is much too narrow a construction of the saving provision of section 14. A writ of error duly issued by a judge having authority to issue writs of error from this court to the District \n\n[274 U.S. 181, 188]\n\u00a0\n Court of the United States, in a case there pending, even though the writ of error is erroneously issued, is, when the writ is executed and the record brought here, to be regarded as having been a case pending in this court from the allowance and issuing of the writ of error and as then removed from the control and jurisdiction of the District Court-and to continue as such for the purposes of section 14 until the writ of error is dismissed. The effect of section 14, therefore, is to impose on this court the duty of granting the transfer to the Circuit Court of Appeals if that is the court, as it is, to which this case should have been taken on error. The previous dismissal of the case is set aside and the transfer of the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is ordered.\n A similar order will be made in the case of Goodbody v. Pennsylvania Company (No. 178) 47 S. Ct. -. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTUCKER v. ALEXANDER(1927)\nNo. 167\nArgued: October 7, 1927Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles H. Garnett, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor General Mitchell, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[275 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, from March 1, 1913, and in 1920, was the owner of shares of stock in a corporation which in the latter year was dissolved and liquidated. A distribution of some portion of its assets to the stockholders had been made in May, 1913. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue taxed as income on dissolution the difference between the value of the property received by petitioner as a liquidating dividend, and the value of his stock on March 1, 1913, less the value of the distribution of May, 1913, which was treated as a return of capital. Petitioner paid the tax under protest, setting up that it was excessive, and after filing a claim for refund brought the present suit in the District Court for Western Oklahoma to recover the excess. In his claim for refund petitioner assigned as reasons for it (1) the Commissioner's erroneous computation of the value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and (2) his failure to deduct duct from the capital and surplus of the company at the date of liquidation the amount of certain outstanding debts which were assumed by the stockholders, but no explicit statement was made that the Commissioner had erred in decreasing the March 1, 1913, value by the value of the property distributed in May, 1913, nor was that point raised by the petition in the district court which in effect merely repeated the allegations of the claim for refund.\n In the course of the trial petitioner without objection by the government abandoned the grounds of recovery stated in the petition and attacked only the Commissioner's deduction of the return of capital from the March 1, 1913, value. That issue alone was litigated. At the close of the trial counsel stipulated that, if the court \n\n[275 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n found the deduction to have been erroneously made, the petitioner should have judgment in the sum named. The District Court's judgment for petitioner was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (15 F.(2d) 356) which held that a recovery on grounds different from those set up in the claim for refund was precluded by section 3226 of the Revised Statutes as amended by section 1014 of the Revenue Act of 1924 ( chapter 234, 43 Stat. 253, 343; U. S. C. tit. 26,  156 (26 USCA  156; Comp. St.  5949)). The case was brought here on certiorari to review this determination. \n273 \nU.S. 689\n, 47 S. Ct. 459.\n Section 3226 provides that:\n'No suit or proceeding shall be maintained ... for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected ... until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury established in pursuance thereof. ...'\n\n And article 1036 of Treasury Regulations No. 45 (1920 Ed.), in force when the claim for refund was filed, requires that such claims 'shall be made on form 46 (revised),' and that 'all the facts relied upon in support of the claim shall be clearly set forth under oath.' In the form referred to a space was provided for the claimant to set out the reasons why his application should be allowed.\n In our view of the case the question considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals was not properly before it and it should have passed upon the merits. During the entire course of the trial no question was raised as to the sufficiency of the claim for refund. The only substantial issue litigated was the correctness of the Commissioner's deduction of the distribution of May, 1913. All other questions were taken out of the case by stipulation.\n If the collector and counsel for the government had power to waive an objection to the sufficiency of the de- \n\n[275 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n scription of the claim filed it was waived here, and we need not consider the precise extent of the requirements prescribed by statute and regulations, nor whether petitioner's claim for refund fell short of satisfying them. The Solicitor General does not urge that the government's possible objection could not be waived, but submits the question for our decision.\n Literal compliance with statutory requirements that a claim or appeal be filed with the Commissioner before suit is brought for a tax refund may be insisted upon by the defendant, whether the collector or the United States. Kings County Savings Institution v. Blair, \n116 \nU.S. 200\n, 6 S. Ct. 353; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 342, 353\n, 354 S., 40 S. Ct. 155; Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, 130. But no case appears to have held that such objections as that urged here may not be dispensed with by stipulation in open court on the trial. The statute and the regulations must be read in the light of their purpose. They are devised, not as traps for the unwary, but for the convenience of government officials in passing upon claims for refund and in preparing for trial. Failure to observe them does not necessarily preclude recovery. If compliance is insisted upon, dismissal of the suit may be followed by a new claim for refund and another suit within the period of limitations. If the Commissioner is not deceived or misled by the failure to describe accurately the claim, as obviously he was not here, it may be more convenient for the government and decidedly in the interest of an orderly administrative procedure that the claim should be disposed of upon its merits on a first trial without imposing upon government and taxpayer the necessity of further legal proceedings. We can perceive no valid reason why the requirements of the requlations may not be waived for that purpose. We are not unmindful of those cases holding that in suits against the government no officer of the government may waive statutes of \n\n[275 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n limitations. Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227\n, 8 S. Ct. 82. Such waivers if allowed would defeat the only purpose of the statute and impose a liability upon the United States which otherwise would not exist-consequences which do not attach to the waiver here.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTUMEY v.

Code, Ohio,  6212-13 et seq.), deprive the accused of due process of law and violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitu- \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n tion, because of the pecuniary and other interest which those statutes give the mayor in the result of the trial.\n Tumey, the plaintiff in error hereafter to be called the defendant, was arrested and brought before Mayor Pugh, of the village of North College Hill, charged with unlawfully possessing intoxicating liquor. He moved for his dismissal because of the disqualification of the mayor to try him under the Fourteenth Amendment. The mayor denied the motion, proceeded to the trial, convicted the defendant of unlawfully possessing intoxicating liquor within Hamilton county as charged, fined him $100, and ordered that he be imprisoned until the fine and costs were paid. He obtained a bill of exceptions and carried the case on error to the court of common pleas of Hamilton county. That court heard the case and reversed the judgment, on the ground that the mayor was disqualified as claimed. 25 Ohio Nisi Prius (N. S.) 580. The state sought review by the Court of Appeals of the First Appellate District of Ohio, which reversed the common pleas and affirmed the judgment of the mayor. 23 Ohio Law Reporter, 634.\n On May 4, 1926, the state Supreme Court refused defendant's application to require the Court of Appeals to certify its record in the case. The defendant then filed a petition in error in that court as of right, asking that the judgment of the mayor's court and of the appellate court be reversed on constitutional grounds. On May 11, 1926, the Supreme Court adjudged that the petition be dismissed for the reason that no debatable constitutional question was involved in the cause. The judgment was then brought here upon a writ of error allowed by the Chief Justice of the state Supreme Court, to which it was rightly directed. Matthews v. Huwe, Treasurer, \n269 \nU.S. 262\n, 46 S. Ct. 108; Hetrick v. Village of Lindsey, \n265 \nU.S. 384\n, 44 S. Ct. 486. This brings us to the merits of the case. \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n The defendant was arrested and charged with the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor at White Oak, another village in Hamilton county, Ohio, on a warrant issued by the mayor of North College Hill. The mayor acted under the sections of the state Prohibition Act and Ordinance No. 125 of the village of North College Hill adopted by pursuance thereof.\n Section 6212-15, General Code, Ohio, provides that:\n'No person shall, after the passage of this act ... manufacture , ... possess, ... any intoxicating liquors. ...'\n\n Section 6212-17 provides that:\n'... Any person who violates the provisions of this act (G. C.  6212-13 to 6212-20) for a first offense shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars; for a second offense he shall be fined not less than three hundred dollars nor more than two thousand dollars; for a third and each subsequent offense, he shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than two thousand dollars and be imprisoned in the state penitentiary not less than one year nor more than five years. ...'\n\n The mayor has authority, which he exercised in this case, to order that the person sentenced to pay a fine shall remain in prison until the fine and costs are paid. At the time of this sentence, the prisoner received a credit of 60 cents a day for each day's imprisonment. By a recent amendment, that credit has increased to $1.50 a day Sections 13716, 13717, Gen. Code Ohio.\n Section 6212-18 provides, in part, that:\n'Any justice of the peace, mayor, municipal or police judge, probate or common pleas judge within the county with whom the affidavit is filed charging a violation of any of the provisions of this act (G. C .  6212-13 to 6212-20) when the offense is alleged to have been committed in the county in which such mayor, justice of the peace, or judge \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n may be sitting, shall have final jurisdiction to try such cases upon such affidavits without a jury, unless imprisonment is a part to the penalty, but error may be prosecuted to the judgment of such mayor, justice of the peace, or judge as herein provided.'\n\n Error from the mayor's court lies to the court of common pleas of the county, and a bill of exceptions is necessary to present questions arising on the evidence. Sections 10359, 10361, General Code Ohio. The appellate review in respect to evidence is such that the judgment can only be set aside by the reviewing court on the ground that it is so clearly unsupported by the weight of the evidence as to indicate some misapprehension or mistake or bias on the part of the trial court or a wilful disregard of duties. Datesh v. State, 23 Ohio Nisi Prius (N. S.) 273.\n Section 6212-19, provides that:\n'Money arising from fines and forfeited bonds shall be paid one-half into the state treasury credited to the general revenue fund, one- half to the treasury of the township, municipality or county where the prosecution is held, according as to whether the officer hearing the case is a township, municipal, or county officer.'\n\n Section 6212-37 provides that:\n'The council of any city or village may, by ordinance, authorize the use of any part of the fines collected for the violation of any law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, for the purpose of hiring attorneys, detectives, or secret service officers to secure the enforcement of such prohibition law. And such council are hereby authorized to appropriate not more than five hundred dollars annually from the general revenue fund, for the purpose of enforcing the law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, when there are no funds available from the fines collected for the violation of such prohibitory law.' 109 Ohio Laws, p. 9,  17.\n\n Under the authority of the last section, the village council of North College Hill passed Ordinance No. 125, as follows:\n\n\n[273 U.S. 510, 518]\n\u00a0\n 'An ordinance to provide for compensation to be paid from the secret service funds of the village of North College Hill, Hamilton county, Ohio, created by authority of section 6212-37, of the General Code of Ohio, to detectives, secret service officers, deputy marshals' and attorneys' fees, costs, etc., for services in securing evidence necessary to conviction and prosecuting violation of the law of the state of Ohio prohibiting the liquor traffic.\n'Be it ordained by the council of the village of North College Hill, Hamilton county, Ohio:\n\n'Section I. That fifty per cent. of all moneys hereafter paid into the treasury to said village of North College Hill, Ohio, that is one- half of the share of all fines collected and paid into and belonging to said village of North College Hill, Ohio, received from fines collected under any law of the state of Ohio, prohibiting the liquor traffic, shall constitute a separate fund to be called the secret service fund to be used for the purpose of securing the enforcement of any prohibition law.\n\n'Section II. That deputy marshals of the village of North College Hill, Ohio, shall receive as compensation for their services in securing the evidence necessary to secure the conviction of persons violating the law of the state of Ohio, prohibiting the liquor traffic, an amount of money equal to 15 per cent. of the fine collected, and other fees allowed by law.\n\n'Section III. That the attorney at law of record prosecuting persons charged with violating the law of the state of Ohio, prohibiting the liquor traffic, shall receive as compensation for legal services an amount equal to 10 per cent. of the fine collected, in all cases, whether the plea be guilty or not guilty.\n\n'Section IV. That detectives and secret service officers shall receive as compensation for their services in securing the evidence necessary to secure the conviction of \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n persons violating the law of the state of Ohio, prohibiting the liquor traffic, an amount of money equal to 15 per cent. of the fine collected.\n\n'Section V. That the mayor of the village of North College Hill, Ohio, shall receive or retain the amount of his costs in each case, in addition to his regular salary, as compensation for hearing such cases.\n\n'Section VI. This ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency ordinance, necessary to the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety, made necessary by reason of the flagrant violation of the laws of Ohio, enacted to prohibit traffic in intoxicating liquors, and shall be in effect from and after this passage.'\n\n The duties of the mayor of a village in Ohio are primarily executive. Section 4248 of the General Code of Ohio provides as follows:\n'Section 4248. The executive power and authority of villages shall be vested in a mayor, clerk, treasurer, marshal, street commissioner, and such other officers and departments thereof as are created by law.\n\n'Section 4255. ... He (the mayor) shall be the chief conservator of the peace within the corporation. ... He shall be the president of the council, and shall preside at all regular and special meetings thereof, but shall have no vote except in case of a tie.\n\n'Section 4258. ... He shall see that all ordinances, by-laws and resolutions of the council are faithfully obeyed and enforced. ...\n\n'Section 4259. The mayor shall communicate to council from time to time a statement of the finances of the municipality, and such other information relating thereto and to the general condition of the affairs of the municipality as he deems proper or as may be required by council.\n\n'Section 4262. The mayor shall supervise the conduct of the officers of the corporation. ...' \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 520]\n\u00a0\n The fees which the mayor and marshal received in this case came to them by virtue of the general statutes of the state applying to all state cases, liquor and otherwise. The mayor was entitled to hold the legal fees taxed in his favor. General Code Ohio,  4270; State v. Nolte, 111 Ohio St. 486, 146 N. E. 51, 37 A. L. R. 1426. Moreover, the North College Hill village council sought to remove all doubt on this point by providing ( section 5, Ordinance 125, supra), that he should receive or retain the amount of his costs in each case in addition to his regular salary, as compensation for hearing such cases. But no fees or costs in such cases are paid him, except by the defendant, if convicted. There is, therefore, no way by which the mayor may be paid for his service as judge, if he does not convict those who are brought before him; nor is there any fund from which marshals, inspectors and detectives can be paid for their services in arresting and bringing to trial and furnishing the evidence to convict in such cases, except it be from the initial $500 which the village may vote from its treasury to set the court going or from a fund created by the fines thereafter collected from convicted defendants.\n\n By an act of 1913 (103 O. L. 290), the mayor's court in villages in Hamilton county, and in half a dozen other counties with large cities, was deprived of jurisdiction to hear and punish misdemeanors committed in the county beyond the limits of the corporation. The Prohibition Act, known as the Crabbe Act, adopted in 1920 (108 O. L. pt. 1, p. 388, and part 2, p. 1182) changed this and gave to the mayor of every village in the state jurisdiction within the county in which it was situate to try violations of that act.\n Counsel for the state in their brief explain the vesting by state Legislatures of this country of jurisdiction in village courts as follows:\n'The purpose of extending the jurisdiction in the first instance was to break up places of outlawry that were located on the municipal boundary just outside of the city. The Legislature also \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 521]\n\u00a0\n faced the situation that in some of the cities the law enforcement agencies were failing to perform their duty, and therefore, in order that those forces that believe in enforcement and upholding of law might have some courts through which process could be had, it gave to mayors county-wide jurisdiction.'\n\n It was further pointed out in argument that the system by which the fines to be collected were to be divided between the state and the village was for the proper purpose of stimulating the activities of the village officers to such due enforcement.\n The village of North College Hill, in Hamilton county, Ohio, is shown by the federal census to have a population of 1,104. That of Hamilton county, including the city of Cincinnati, is more than half a million. The evidence discloses that Mayor Pugh came to office after Ordinance No. 125 was adopted, and that there was a division of public sentiment in the village as to whether the ordinance should continue in effect. A petition opposing it and signed by a majority of the voters was presented to Mayor Pugh. To this the mayor answered with the declaration that, if the village was in need of finances, he was in favor of and would carry on 'the liquor court,' as it was popularly called, but that, if the court was not needed for village financial reasons, he would not do so. It appears that substantial sums were expended out of the village treasury from the fund made up of the fines thus collected for village improvements and repairs. The mayor was the owner of a house in the village.\n Between May 11, 1923, and December 31, 1923, the total amount of fines for violation of the prohibition law collected by this village court was upwards of $20,000, from which the state received $8,992.50, North College Hill received $4,471.25 for its general uses, $2,697.25 was placed to the credit of the village safety fund, and the balance was put in the secret service fund. Out of this, the person acting as prosecutor in the liquor court re- \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 522]\n\u00a0\n ceived in that period $1,796.50; the deputy marshals, inspectors and other employees, including the detectives, received $2,697.75; and $438.50 was paid for costs in transporting prisoners, serving writs and other services in connection with the trial of these cases. Mayor Pugh received $696.35 from these liquor cases during that period as his fees and costs, in addition to his regular salary.\n That officers acting in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity are disqualified by their interest in the controversy to be decided is of course the general rule. Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal, 3 H. L. C. 759; Gregory v. Railroad, 4 Ohio St. 675; Pearce v. Atwood, 13 Mass. 324; Taylor v. Commissioners, 105 Mass. 225; Kentish Artillery v. Gardiner, 15 R.

Nice questions, however, often arise as to what the degree or nature of the interest must be. One is in respect to the effect of the membership of a judge in a class of taxpayers or others to be affected by a principle of law, statutory or constitutional, to be applied in a case between other parties and in which the judge has no other interest. Then the circumstance that there is no judge not equally disqualified to act in such a case has been held to affect the question. Wheeling v. Black, 25 W. Va. 266, 280; Peck v. Freeholders of Essex, 20 N. J. Law, 457; Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal, 3 H. L. C. 759 ( see Baron Parke's Answer for the Judges, pp. 785, 787); Year Book, 8 Henry VI, 19; s. c. 2 Roll. Abridg. 93; Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245, 247\n, 40 S. Ct. 550, 11 A. L. R. 519; Stuart v. Mechanics' & Farmers' Bank, 19 Johns. (N. Y.) 496; Ranger v. Railroad, 5 H. L. C. 72. We are not embarrassed by such considerations here, for there were available in this case other judicial officers who had \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 523]\n\u00a0\n no disqualification, either by reason of the character of their compensation or their relation to the village government.\n All questions of judicial qualification may not involve constitutional validity. Thus matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion. Wheeling v. Black, 25 W. Va. 266, 270. But it certainly violates the Fourteenth Amendment and deprives a defendant in a criminal case of due process of law to subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court, the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case.\n The mayor of the village of North College Hill, Ohio, has a direct personal pecuniary interest in convicting the defendant who came before him for trial, in the $12 of costs imposed in his behalf, which he would not have received if the defendant had been acquitted. This was not exceptional, but was the result of the normal operation of the law and the ordinance. Counsel for the state do not deny this, but assert the validity of the practice as an exception to the general rule. They rely upon the cases of Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94\n, 41 S. Ct. 433, 17 A. L. R. 873; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276-280.\n These cases show that in determining what due process of law is, under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment, the court must look to those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England before the emigration of our ancestors, which were shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country. Counsel contend that in Ohio and in other states, in the economy which it is found necessary to maintain in the administration of justice in the inferior courts by justices of the peace and by judicial officers of like jurisdiction, the only compensation which the state and county \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 524]\n\u00a0\n and township can afford is the fees and costs earned by them, and that such compensation is so small that it is not to be regarded as likely to influence improperly a judicial officer in the discharge of his duty, or as prejudicing the defendant in securing justice. even though the magistrate will receive nothing if the defendant is not convicted.\n We have been referred to no cases at common law in England, prior to the separation of colonies from the mother country, showing a practice that inferior judicial officers were dependant upon the conviction of the defendant for receiving their compensation. Indeed, in analogous cases it is very clear that the slightest pecuniary interest of any officer, judicial or quasi judicial, in the resolving of the subject-matter which he was to decide, rendered the decision voidable. Bonham's Case, 8 Coke, 118a; same case, 2 Brownlow & Goldesborough's Reports, 255; City of London v. Wood, 12 Modern Reports, 669, 687; Day v. Savage, Hobart, 85, 87; Hesketh v. Braddock, 3 Burrows, 1847, 1856, 1857, 1858\n\n\n As early as 12 Richard II, A. D. 1388, it was provided that there should be a commission of the justices of the peace, with six justices in the county once a quarter, which might sit for three days, and that the justices should receive four shillings a day 'as wages,' to be paid by the sheriffs out of a fund make up of fines and amercements, and that that fund should be added to out of the fines and amercements from the Courts of the Lords of the Franchises which were hundred courts allowed by the king by grant to individuals.\n It was required that the justices of the peace should be knights, esquires, or gentlemen of the land, qualifications that were not modified until 1906. The wages paid were used 'to defray their common diet,' and they soon became obsolete. Holdsworth's History of English Law, 288, 289. The wages paid were not dependant on con- \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 525]\n\u00a0\n viction of the defendant. They were paid at a time when the distinction between torts and criminal cases was not clear. Holdworth, vol. 2, pp. 363, 365; Id. vol. 3, p. 328. And they came from a fund which was created by fines and amercements collected from both sides in the controversy. There was always a plaintiff, whether in the action for a tort or the prosecution for an offense. In the latter he was called the prosecutor. If he failed to prove his case, whether civil or criminal, he was subject to amercement pro falso clamore, while, if he succeeded, the defendant was in misericordia. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 5 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 195, 198; Musser v. Good, 11 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 247. Thus in the outcome some one would be amerced in every case, and the amercements generally went to the crown, and the fund was considerable. The statute of Richard II remained on the statute book until 1855 when it was repealed by St. 18 and 19 Victoria. Meantime the hundred courts by franchise had largely disappeared. The wages referred to were not part of the costs. The costs at common law were the amounts paid either by the plaintiff or prosecutor or by the defendant for the witnesses or services of the court officers. Burn's Justice, vol. 1, p. 628; Chitty's Criminal Law (4th Ed. 1841) vol. 1, p. 829. See, also, St. 14 George III, c. 20, 1774. For hundreds of years the justices of the peace of England seem not to have received compensation for court work. Instead of that they were required, upon entering upon the office, to pay certain fees. Holdsworth, vol. 1, p. 289; 19 Halsbury's Laws of England,  1152. Local judges in towns are paid salaries.\n There was at the common law the greatest sensitiveness over the existence of any pecuniary interest however small or infinitesimal in the justices of the peace. In Hawkins, 2 Pleas of the Crown, Bk. 2, ch. 8,  68, 69 we find the following:\n'The general rule of law certainly is that justices of the peace ought not to execute their office in their own case (citing 1 Salk. 396); and even in cases where such \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 526]\n\u00a0\n proceeding seems indispensably necessary, as in being publicly assaulted or personally abused, or their authority otherwise contemned while in the execution of their duty, yet if another justice be present, his assistance should be required to punish the offender (Stra. 240).\n\n'And by the common law, if an order of removal were made by two justices, and one of them was an inhabitant of the parish from which the pauper was removed, such order was illegal and bad, on the ground that the justice who was an inhabitant, was interested, as being liable to the poor's rate. Rex v. Great Chart, Burr. S. C. 194, Stra. 1173.'\n\n And this strict principle, unless there is relief by the statute, is seen in modern cases. Queen v. Recorder of Cambridge, 8 Ellis & Blackburn, 637; Regina v. Hammond, 9 Law Times Reports (N. S.) 423; The Queen v. Rand, Law Reports, 1 Queen's Bench, 230; Queen v. Gaisford (1892) 1 Queen's Bench Division, 381; 19 Halsbury's Laws of England, 1156.\n There was then no usage at common law by which justices of the peace or inferior judicial officers were paid fees on condition that they convicted the defendants, and such a practice certainly cannot find support as due process of law in English precedent. It may be that the principle as stated in Blackstone, book 3, p. 400, that the king shall neither pay nor receive costs, because it is the king's prerogative not to pay them to a subject and is beneath his dignity to receive them, was misunderstood and led, as suggested by Mr. Lewis in his edition of Blackstone (see Lewis' Blackstone, note No. 60, vol. III, p. 400) to the practice in some states in minor cases of allowing inferior judges no compensation, except by fees collected of the convicted defendant, but, whether it did or not, the principle relied on did not support the practice. That practice has prevailed and still prevails in Arkansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, and Texas, and it seems \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 527]\n\u00a0\n at one time to have obtained in Indiana, Oregon, Illinois, and Alabama.\n In two of these states only has the question been considered by their courts, and it has been held that provision for payment to the judge of fees only in case of conviction does not disqualify him. Those are Bennett v. State, 4 Tex. App. 72; Wellmaker v. Terrell, 3 Ga. App. 791, 60 S. E. 464. There is no discussion in either of the question of due process of law. The existence of a statute authorizing the practice seems to have been the controlling consideration. Two other cases are cited. In Ex parte Guerrero, 69 Cal. 88, 10 P. 261, the judge was paid a regular salary fixed by law. The fund out of which this was paid was increased by fees and fines collected in his court, but there is no evidence that payment of his salary was dependent on the amount of his collections or convictions. In Herbert v. Baltimore County, 97 Md. 639, 55 A. 376, the action was by a justice of the peace against a county for services in criminal cases. A new law limited him to $10 a month. The statement of the case does not distinctly show that in convictions he would have had a larger compensation from his costs collected out of the defendant, but this may be assumed from the argument. His contention was that the new law was invalid, because it did not give the defendants before him due process. The court held against him, chiefly on the ground that he must be satisfied with the compensation the law afforded him. Responding to his argument that the new law was invalid, because justice would be induced to convict when in justice they should acquit, the court said:\n'We cannot recognize the force of this suggestion, founded as it is upon the assumption that the justices will violate their oaths and the duties of their office, and not upon anything that the law authorizes to be done.'\n\n So far as the case goes, it is an authority for the contention of the state, but the issue thus raised was not \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 528]\n\u00a0\n considered at length, and was not one which in such an action the court would be patient to hear pressed by the justice, whose constitutional rights were not affected. Tyler v. Court, \n179 \nU.S. 405, 409\n, 21 S. Ct. 206; California Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works, \n199 \nU.S. 306, 318\n, 26 S. Ct. 100.\n In the case of Probasco v. Raine, Auditor, 50 Ohio St. 378, 34 N. E. 536, the question arose whether the fee of 4 per cent. payable to county auditors for placing omitted property on the duplicate list for taxation, which required investigation and quasi judicial consideration, was invalid. The court held that it was not, and that the objection urged there could not be based on the argument that a man could not be a judge in his own case; that the auditor had no case to be adjudged, but that, on the contrary, he was the taxing officer, before whom other parties were cited to appear and show cause why they should not bear their equal burden of taxation. The court said that the action of the auditor was not final, so as to cut off further inquiry, but that the whole case might be gone into anew by proper proceedings in court. An exactly opposite conclusion was reached by the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Ohio in Meyers v. Shields, 61 F. 713, 725, et seq.\n In other states than those above mentioned the minor courts are paid for their services by the state or county, regardless of acquittal or conviction, except that in Virginia the minor courts receive one-half of the usual fees where there is acquittal. Four states have put into their Constitutions a provision that the state must pay the costs in such cases in case of acquittal. They are California, Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina.\n The strict common-law rule was adopted in this country as one to be enforced where nothing but the common law controlled, and citizens and taxpayers have been held incompetent to sit in suits against the municipal corporation of which they have been residents. Diveny v. \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 529]\n\u00a0\n Elmira, 51 N. Y. 506; Corwein v. Hames, 11 Johns. (N. Y.) 76; Clark v. Lamb, 2 Allen (Mass.) 396; Dively v. Cedar Falls, 21 Iowa, 565; Fulweiler v. Louis, 61 Mo. 479; Petition of New Boston, 49 N. H. 328; Commonwealth v. McLane, 4 Gray (Mass.) 427; Fine v. St. Louis Public Schools, 30 Mo. 166, 173. With other courts, however, and with the Legislatures, the strict rule seemed to be inconvenient, impracticable, and unnecessary, and the view was taken that such remote or minute interest in the litigation might be declared by the Legislature not to be a reason for disqualification of a judge or juror.\n A case, much cited, in which this conclusion was reached, and in which the old English corporation cases were considered, was that of City Council v. Pepper, 1 Rich. (S. C.) 364. The recorder of the city of Charleston sentenced a nonresident of the city for violation of a city ordinance requiring him to take out a license for what he did, or to pay a fine not exceeding $20. The contention was that the defendant was a noncorporator and nonresident, and not subject to the jurisdiction of the city court; that the recorder was a corporator and interested in the penalty, and therefore was not competent to try the cause. The court said ( page 366) in respect to Hesketh v. Braddock, 3 Burr. 1847, supra:\n'It will be remarked that that case depends altogether upon the common law, and if the city court depended upon the same for its jurisdiction, the objection might be fatal. But the establishment and jurisdiction of the city court commences with the act of 1801. ... By that act it is clothed with the power of trying all offences against the by-laws of the city, and for that purpose is given concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Sessions. This grant of power is from all the people of the state, through their Legislature, and surely they have the power to dispense with the common-law objection, that the cor- \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 530]\n\u00a0\n porators were interested, and ought not to be intrusted with the enforcement of their laws against others. The authority given to the city court to try all offenders against the city ordinances, impliedly declares, that notwithstanding the common-law objection, it was right had proper to give it the power to enforce the city laws against all offenders. That there was great reason in this cannot be doubted, when it is remembered that the interest of the corporators is so minute as not to be even thought of, by sheriff, juror or judge. It is very much like the interest which similar officers would feel in enforcing a state law, the sanction of which was a penalty. The sum thus to be recovered goes in exoneration of some part of the burden of government to which every citizen is subjected; but such an interest has no effect upon the mind. It is too slight to excite prejudice against a defendant. The same thing is the case here. For the judge, sheriff and jurors, are members of a corporation of many thousand members. What interest, of value, have they in a fine of $20? It would put a most eminent calculator to great trouble to ascertain the very minute grain of interest which each of these gentlemen might have. To remove so shadowy and slight an objection, the Legislature thought proper to clothe the city court, consisting of its judge, clerk, sheriff and jurors, with authority to try the defendant, and he cannot now object to it.'\n\n And the same view is taken in Commonwealth v. Ryan, 5 Mass. 90; Commonwealth v. Reed, 1 Gray (Mass.) 472, 475; Thomas v. Mt. Vernon, 9 Ohio, 290; Commissioners v. Lytle, 3 Ohio, 289; Wheeling v. Black, 25 W. Va. 266, 280; Board of Justices v. Fennimore, 1 N. J. Law, 190; Foreman v. Marianna, 43 Ark. 324; Cartersville v. Lyon, 69 Ga. 577; Omaha v. Olmstead, 5 Neb. 446; Hill v. Wells, 6 Pick. (Mass.) 104; Commonwealth v. Emery, 11 Cush. (Mass.) 406; Bennett \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 531]\n\u00a0\n v. State, 4 Tex. App. 72; Welmaker v. Terrell, 3 Ga. App. 791, 60 S. E. 464; State v. Craig, 80 Me. 85, 13 A. 129.\n Mr. Justice Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations (7th edition, page 594), points out that the real ground of the ruling in these cases is that:\n'Interest is so remote, trifling, and insignificant that it may fairly be supposed to be incapable of affecting the judgment of or of influencing the conduct of an individual. And where penalties are imposed, to be recovered only in a municipal court, the judge or jurors in which would be interested as corporators in the recovery, the law providing for such recovery must be regarded as precluding the objection of interest.'\n\n But the learned judge then proceeds:\n'But, except in cases resting upon such reasons, we do not see how the Legislature can have any power to abolish a maxim which is among the fundamentals of judicial authority.'\n\n Referring, then, to a remark in the case of the Matter of Leefe, 2 Barb. Ch. (N. Y.) 39, that the people of the state, when framing their Constitution, might possibly establish so great an anomaly, if they saw fit, the learned author says:\n'Even this must be deemed doubtful, since the adoption of the fourteenth article of the Amendments to the federal Constitution, which denies to the state the right to deprive one of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'\n\n From this review we conclude that a system by which an inferior judge is paid for his service only when he convicts the defendant has not become so embedded by custom in the general practice, either at common law or in this country, that it can be regarded as due process of law, unless the costs usually imposed are so small that they may be properly ignored as within the maxim 'de minimis non curat lex.'\n The mayor received for his fees and costs in the present case $12, and from such costs under the Prohibition Act \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 532]\n\u00a0\n for seven months he made about $100 a month, in addition to his salary. We cannot regard the prospect of receipt or loss of such an emolument in each case as a minute, remote, trifling, or insignificant interest. It is certainly not fair to each defendant brought before the mayor for the careful and judicial consideration of his guilt or innocence that the prospect of such a prospective loss by the mayor should weigh against his aquittal.\n These are not cases in which the penalties and the costs are negligible. The field of jurisdiction is not that of a small community, engaged in enforcing its own local regulations. The court is a state agency, imposing substantial punishment, and the cases to be considered are gathered from the whole county by the energy of the village marshals and detectives regularly employed by the village for the purpose. It is not to be treated as a mere village tribunal for village peccadilloes. There are doubtless mayors who would not allow such a consideration as $12 costs in each case to affect their judgment in it, but the requirement of due process of law in judicial procedure is not satisfied by the argument that men of the highest honor and the greatest self-sacrifice could carry it on without danger of injustice. Every procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear, and true between the state and the accused denies the latter due process of law.\n But the pecuniary interest of the mayor in the result of his judgment is not the only reason for holding that due process of law is denied to the defendant here. The statutes were drawn to stimulate small municipalities, in the country part of counties in which there are large cities, to organize and maintain courts to try persons accused of violations of the Prohibition Act everywhere in the county. The inducement is offered of dividing between \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 533]\n\u00a0\n the state and the village the large fines provided by the law for its violations. The trial is to be had before a mayor without a jury, without opportunity for retrial, and with a review confined to questions of law presented by a bill of exceptions, with no opportunity by the reviewing court to set aside the judgment on the weighing of evidence, unless it should appear to be so manifestly against the evidence as to indicate mistake, bias, or willful disregard of duty by the trial court. It specifically authorizes the village to employ detectives, deputy marshals, and other assistants to detect crime of this kind all over the county, and to bring offenders before the mayor's court, and it offers to the village council and its officers a means of substantially adding to the income of the village to relieve it from further taxation. The mayor is the chief executive of the village. He supervises all the other executive officers. He is charged with the business of looking after the finances of the village. It appears from the evidence in this case, and would be plain if the evidence did not show it, that the law is calculated to awaken the interest of all those in the village charged with the responsibility of raising the public money and expending it, in the pecuniarily successful conduct of such a court. The mayor represents the village and cannot escape his representative capacity. On the other hand, he is given the judicial duty, first, of determining whether the defendant is guilty at all; and, second, having found his guilt, to measure his punishment between $100 as a minimum and $1,000 as a maximum for first offenses, and $ 300 as a minimum and $2,000 as a maximum for second offenses. With his interest as mayor in the financial condition of the village and his responsibility therefor, might not a defendant with reason say that he feared he could not get a fair trial or a fair sentence from one who would have so strong a motive to help his village by conviction and a heavy fine? The old English cases cited above in the \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 534]\n\u00a0\n days of Coke and Holt and Mansfield are not nearly so strong. A situation in which an official perforce occupies two practically and seriously inconsistent positions, one partisan and the other judicial, necessarily involves a lack of due process of law in the trial of defendants charged with crimes before him. City of Boston v. Baldwin, 139 Mass. 315, 1 N. E. 417; Florida ex rel. Colcord v. Young, 31 Fla. 594, 12 So. 673, 19 L. R. A. 636, 34 Am. St. Rep. 41. It is, of course, so common to vest the mayor of villages with inferior judicial functions that the mere union of the executive power and the judicial power in him cannot be said to violate due process of law. The minor penalties usually attaching to the ordinances of a village council, or to the misdemeanors in which the mayor may pronounce final judgment without a jury, do not involve any such addition to the revenue of the village as to justify the fear that the mayor would be influenced in his judicial judgment by that fact. The difference between such a case and the plan and operation of the statutes before us is so plain as not to call for further elaboration.\n Counsel for the state argue that it has been decided by this court that the Legislature of a state may provide such system of courts as it chooses, that there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that requires a jury trial for any offender, that it may give such territorial jurisdiction to its courts as it sees fit, and therefore that there is nothing sinister or constitutionally invalid in giving to a village mayor the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace to try misdemeanors committed anywhere in the county, even though the mayor presides over a village of 1, 100 people and exercises jurisdiction over offenses committed in a county of 500,000. This is true and is established by the decisions of this court in Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n, 30; In re Claasen, \n140 \nU.S. 200\n, 11 S. Ct. 735. See, also, Carey v. State, 70 Ohio St. 121, 70 N. E. 955. It is also correctly pointed out that it is completely within the power of the Legislature to dispose of the fines collected \n\n[273 U.S. 510, 535]\n\u00a0\n in criminal cases as it will, and it may therefore divide the fines as it does here, one-half of the state and one-half to the village by whose mayor they are imposed and collected. It is further said with truth that the Legislature of a state may and often ought to stimulate prosecutions for crime by offering to those who shall initiate and carry on such prosecutions rewards for thus acting in the interest of the state and the people. The Legislature may offer rewards or a percentage of the recovery to informers. United States v. Murphy & Morgan, 16 Pet. 203. It may authorize the employment of detectives. But these principles do not at all affect the question whether the state, by the operation of the statutes we have considered, has not vested the judicial power in on who by reason of his interest, both as an individual and as chief executive of the village, is disqualified to exercise it in the trial of the defendant.\n It is finally argued that the evidence shows clearly that the defendant was guilty and that he was only fined $100 which was the minimum amount, and therefore that he cannot complain of a lack of due process, either in his conviction or in the amount of the judgment. The plea was not guilty and he was convicted. No matter what the evidence was against him, he had the right to have an impartial judge. He seasonably raised the objection, and was entitled to halt the trial because of the disqualification of the judge, which existed both because of his direct pecuniary interest in the outcome, and because of his official motive to convict and to graduate the fine to help the financial needs of the village. There were thus presented at the outset both features of the disqualification.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTWIST v. PRAIRIE OIL & GAS CO.(1927)\nNo. 301\nArgued: April 28, 1927Decided: June 6, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 684, 685]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul Pinson and D. Hayden Linebaugh, both of Muskogee, Okl., for petitioners.\n Mr. Preston C. West, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases are here on writ of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \n270 \nU.S. 639, 640\n, 46 S. Ct. 355. That court had before it for review, on appeal and cross-appeal, a final decree in equity of \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 686]\n\u00a0\n the District Court for Eastern Oklahoma. The case had been heard by the trial court on the evidence as a suit an equity, and had been treated as such in both courts by both parties. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court did not have jurisdiction in equity; ruled, of its own motion, that the case must be deemed to have been tried below as one at law on an oral waiver of jury; and that, since there had been no waiver filed with the clerk as provided in section 649 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1587), and no bill of exceptions or special findings of fact as provided in section 700 (Comp. St.  1668), the appellate court could not consider the errors assigned by the parties. It therefore affirmed the judgment on the pleadings. 6 F. (2d) 347, 349. Whether the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in so ruling is the only question requiring decision. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In 1917 the Prairie Oil & Gas Company acquired by assignment an oil and gas lease, together with an extension thereof, and entered into possession of the land covered thereby. The lessor was William G. Twist, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation to whom the land had been allotted. After Twist's death kand the expiration of the original lease, his children brought this suit in a state court of Oklahoma seeking relief on the ground that the extension was invalid because of fraud, and also because certain statutory requirements had not been observed. Two causes of action were therein set forth. In one, damages were sought as for an alleged trespass. In the other, it was charged that the purported extension of the lease constitutes a cloud upon plaintiffs' title, and the plaintiffs prayed for a declaration as to the ownership, for cancellation of the extension for quieting of plaintiffs' title, and for an injunction against further trespass \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 687]\n\u00a0\n or claim by defendant. Such joinder in a single suit of a cause of action at law with one in equity is permissible under the Oklahoma statute, and under the state law a suit to quiet title may apparently be brought by one out of possession against one in possession. Compiled Oklahoma Statutes 1921, c. 3, art. 14 (sections 466-471).\n The company, the defendant below, removed the case to the federal court for Eastern Oklahoma on the ground of diversity of citizenship. In the federal court the joinder of an action at law with one in equity is not allowable. Hurt v. Hollingsworth, \n100 U.S. 100\n; Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas Ry., Co., \n135 \nU.S. 641, 651\n, 10 S. Ct. 965. Unless the first cause of action stated in the bill could have been construed as asking an accounting incidental to the equitable relief asked, the pleading should have been recast, so as to separate the action at law from the suit in equity, and each case should have proceeded separately according to its nature. Compare Hatcher v. Hendrie & Bolthoff Mfg. & Supply Co. (C. C. A.) 133 F. 267, 271; Knoxville v. Southern Paving Co. (D. C.) 223 F. 236, 238. Neither party sought to have this done. The defendant caused the case to be docketed as a case in equity, and filed a single answer to both causes of action. Therein it objected that the petition did not state facts sufficient in law or in equity to entitle the plaintiff to the relief prayed for, or to any relief, and then, taking up the several allegations of the petition, admitted some, denied others, and set up new matter. The answer prays that the petition be dismissed for want of equity, but also asks affirmative relief. It prays:\n'That the court, by its decree, declare and determine that the defendant's title to said oil and gas lease, as modified and extended, is good, valid, and subsisting as against the claim of the plaintiff, and that its title thereto be quieted as against said claims.'\n\n A reply to the new matter was filed by plaintiffs. \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 688]\n\u00a0\n The proceedings on the appeals were throughout those customary in an equity cause. The records were full and complete. They include, among other things, all of the evidence. The decree declared that the defendant is the owner of the extended oil and gas lease covering eleven-fifteenths interest in the described lands; that two of the plaintiffs are the owners of the remaining fourfifteenths interest; that these two plaintiffs recover four-fifteenths 'of the net proceeds of the oil gas produced from said land from September 29, 1919, to April 1, 1923' (the amount of which was agreed upon); and that 'the amount produced since April 1, 1923 (be) reserved for further consideration.' Both the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Neither party assigned as error that there was lack of jurisdiction in equity or a lack of equity. The errors assigned disclosed claims that the District Court erred in admitting evidence, in excluding evidence, in refusing to set aside the extension, in making certain findings, in making certain rulings, in decreeing that the defendant was the owner of the eleven-fifteenths interest in the extended lease, in decreeing that two of the plaintiffs were the owners of four-fifteenths, in concluding that the extension of the lease held by the defendant constituted a cloud upon the title of these two and in decreeing the removal of that cloud, in concluding that they were entitled to two-fifteenths of the net proceeds, and in ordering payment of the agreed amount.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that it was without power to review the case as upon an appeal from an equity cause, or to consider any of the errors assigned. Because in its opinion there was a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, it held that the case must be deemed to have been tried in the District Court as an action at law without a jury. And it applied the rule, that where and action at law is tried without a jury and there has been \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 689]\n\u00a0\n no waiver of the jury in the manner prescribed by the statute and no special findings or bill of exceptions, the appellate court is without power to review any question except those which arise on the process, pleadings or judgment. See Law v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 494\n, 45 S. Ct. 175; United States v. Archibald McNeil & Sons, \n267 \nU.S. 302\n, 45 S. Ct. 258; Fleischmann Construction Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 356\n, 46 S. Ct. 284; Cleveland v. Walsh Construction Co. (C. C. A.) 279 F. 57. The statutory rule limiting the scope of review by an appellate court in jury-waived cases was not applicable to the case at bar. This is not an action at law.\n In federal courts, as in others, a plaintiff has a right to choose whether he will seek to enforce a legal or an equitable cause a action and whether he will seek legal or equitable relief. He makes his election and proceeds at law or in equity at his peril. See Perego v. Dodge, \n163 \nU.S. 160, 164\n, 16 S. Ct. 971. Formerly, if a plaintiff in a federal court sued in equity, and the objection that there was a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law was sustained, the bill was necessarily dismissed. Curriden v. Middleton, \n232 \nU.S. 633\n, 34 S. Ct. 458. And ordinarily the dismissal was required to be without prejudice to an action at law, Horsburg v. Baker, 1 Pet. 232, 237; Thompson v. Railroad Companies, 6 Wall. 134, 139; Van Norden v. Morton, \n99 U.S. 378\n, 382; Rogers v. Durant, \n106 \nU.S. 644\n, 1 S. Ct. 623; Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106, 117\n, 11 S. Ct. 712; Lacassagne v. Chapuis, \n144 \nU.S. 119, 126\n, 12 S. Ct. 659; though possibly such precaution was unnecessary. Ash Sheep Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 159, 170\n, 40 S. Ct. 241. Now, under the Act of March 3, 1915, c. 90,  274a, 38 Stat. 956 (Comp. St.  1251a), and equity rules 22 and 23, if the suit was improperly brought in equity, either the trial court or the appellate court may transfer the case to the law side. Compare Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Bank, \n260 U.S. 235\n, 241-243, 43 S. Ct. 118; Pierce v. National Bank of Commerce, 268 F. 487, 489; Equitable Trust Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 250 F. 327, 340. The practice is the same in suits re- \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 690]\n\u00a0\n moved from a state court, except that the suit is remanded to the state court where the equitable relief sought, although beyond the equitable jurisdiction of the federal court, may be granted by the state court. Compare Cates v. Allen, \n149 \nU.S. 451\n, 13 S. Ct. 883, 977; Knoxville v. Southern Paving Co. (D. C.) 220 F. 236, 237.\n The parties cannot, of course, compel the trial court to hear in equity a suit which seeks a legal a legal remedy for a legal cause of action. Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 466. Nor can the task of reviewing such a case as if it were actually an equity cause be imposed upon the appellate court through consent of the parties. See Elkhart Carriage & Motor Car Co. v. Partin (C. C. A.) 9 F.(2d) 393. Either the trial court or the appellate may, of its own motion, take the objection that the case is not within the equity jurisdiction. Compare Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S. Ct. 486. But that objection, whether taken in the trial court or in the appellate court, does not go to the power of the court as a federal court.\n The decree in the case at bar rests upon the second cause of action set forth in the bill and the answer thereto. We must disregard, as the lower court and the parties did, the first cause of action. The features of the second cause of action are all those of a bill to remove a cloud and to quiet title. The bill prays for a declaration of the rights of the respective parties; for the cancellation of an agreement; for an injunction against the assertion of certain rights; and for general relief. The answer embodied what is in effect a cross-bill. The relief sought by the bill and the cross-bill is of a character within the recognized sphere of federal equity jurisdiction. See United States v. Wilson, \n118 \nU.S. 86\n, 6 S. Ct. 991. The recovery, as upon an accounting, of the agreed amount of the net profits was a normal incident of such a bill. \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 691]\n\u00a0\n Clarke v. White, 12 Pet. 178, 187, 188; Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, \n200 \nU.S. 341\n, 26 S. Ct. 298. Compare The Salton Sea Cases (C. C. A.) 172 F. 792, 799-802; Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 218 F. 288, 301, 302. It may be that the bill was fatally defective. But the proceeding was unmistakably a suit in equity. The plaintiffs attempted to state a cause of action cognizable by a court of equity. They sought equitable relief.\n It is true that ordinarily one out of possession may not bring in a federal court a bill to quiet title, against one in possession, because there is a full, adequate, and complete remedy at law and the defendant is entitled to a jury trial. See Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 \nU.S. 146\n, 11 S. Ct. 276; Black v. Jackson, \n177 \nU.S. 349, 363\n, 364 S., 20 S. Ct. 648; Lancaster v. Kathleen Oil Co., \n241 \nU.S. 551, 555\n, 36 S. Ct. 711. But the suit is of a class within the jurisdiction-that is, the power-of a federal court sitting in equity. There are cases in the federal courts in which suits in equity to quiet title brought by one out of possession against one in possession have been entertained, because of the special facts, or because of the particular relief sought, or because the defendant waived the objection of lack of equity jurisdiction. Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, \n142 \nU.S. 417\n, 12 S. Ct. 239; Schroeder v. Young, \n161 \nU.S. 334, 345\n, 16 S. Ct. 512. Compare Stewart v. Masterson, \n131 \nU.S. 151\n, 9 S. Ct. 682; Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195\n, 47 S. Ct. 566; Jones v. Prairie Oil & Gas Co., \n273 \nU.S. 195\n, 47 S. Ct. 338; Kilgore v. Norman (C. C.) 119 F. 1006, affirmed (C. C.

Such waiver is possible, because the objection that the bill does not make a case within the equity jurisdiction of a federal court goes not to the power of the court as a federal court, but to the merits. Blythe v. Hinckley, \n173 \nU.S. 501\n, 19 S. Ct. 497; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 U.S. 491\n, \n\n[274 U.S. 684, 692]\n\u00a0\n 500, 43 S. Ct. 454. Compare Burnrite Coal Briquette Co. v. Riggs, \n274 \nU.S. 208\n, 47 S. Ct. 578; Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195\n, 47 S. Ct. 566.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, being of opinion that the plaintiffs had not extablished a right to relief in equity, because there was a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, might, on the undisputed facts, have reversed the decree on that ground without considering the specific errors assigned, and, rightly or wrongly, it might have ordered the bill dismissed without prejudice to the remedy at law, or might conceivably have ordered the case transferred to the law docket, or might have considered the case on the merits as on an equity appeal, in the view that at such stage of the proceedings it was desirable to hold that the objection to the equity jurisdiction had been waived. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, \n200 \nU.S. 341\n, 26 S. Ct. 296. But it could not, while refusing to consider the errors assigned, retain the case and adjudicate the merits. This it did when if affirmed the decree. It was error to declare that this proceeding, which is a bill in equity in its nature as well as in its form, and which seeks relief that only a court of equity can give (Lancaster v. Kathleen Oil Co., \n241 \nU.S. 551, 555\n, 36 S. Ct. 711), shall be deemed an action at law, because the only remedy open to the plaintiffs was at law. Compare Spring Garden Insurance Co. v. Amusement Syndicate Co. (C. C. A.) 178 F. 519, 530. The suit at bar is not like Elkhart Carriage & Motor Car Co. v. Partin (C. C. A.) 9 F. (2d) 393, an action at law masquerading as a suit in equity.\n Because the Circuit Court of Appeals should have considered the errors assigned as in an equity cause but did not, we reverse its judgment and remand the case to it for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. See Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank, \n260 \nU.S. 235, 245\n, 43 S.

BANTON(1927)\nNo. 261\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1927\n\n\n Banton \n273 U.S. 418\n (1927) ]\n\n\n[273 U.S. 418, 420]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 418, 426]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert P. Beyer and F. C. Benvenga, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is engaged in the business of reselling tickets of admission to theaters and other places of entertainment in the city of New York. It employs a large number of salesmen, messenger boys and others. Its expenses are very large, and its sales average approximately 300,000 tickets per annum. These tickets are obtained either from the box office of the theater or from other brokers and distributors. It is duly licensed under section 168, c. 590, Laws N. Y. 1922, and has given a bond under section 169 of that chapter in the penal sum of $1,000, with sureties, conditioned, among other things, that it will not be guilty of any fraud or extortion. See Weller v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 319, 322\n, 45 S. Ct. 556. \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 427]\n\u00a0\n Section 167 of chapter 590 declares that the price of or charge for admission to theaters, etc., is a matter affected with a public interest and subject to state supervision, in order to safeguard the public against fraud, extortion, exorbitant rates, and similar abuses. Section 172 forbids the resale of any ticket or other evidence of the right of entry to any theater, etc., 'at a price in excess of fifty cents in advance of the price printed on the face of such ticket or other evidence of the right of entry,' such printing being required by that section. Both sections are reproduced in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This suit was brought to enjoin respondents from proceeding either at law or in equity to enforce the last-named section, and from revoking plaintiff's license, enforcing by suit or otherwise the penalty of the bond or prosecuting criminally appellant or any of its officers or agents for reselling or attempting to resell any ticket or other evidence of the right of entry to any theater, etc., at a price in excess of 50 cents in advance of the printed \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 428]\n\u00a0\n price. The bill alleges threats on the part of appellees to enforce the statute against appellant, to forfeit its license, enforce the penalty of its bond and institute criminal prosecutions against appellant, its officers and agents. It is further alleged that the terms of the statute are so drastic and the penalties for its violation so great (imprisonment for one year or a fine of $250 or both) that appellant may not resell any ticket or evidence of the right of entry at a price beyond that fixed by the statute even for the purpose of testing the validity of the law, and that appellant will be compelled to submit to the statute whether valid or invalid unless its suit be entertained, and thereby will be deprived of its property and liberty without due process of law and denied the equal protection of the law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. Following the rule frequently announced by this court, that 'equitable jurisdiction exists to restrain criminal prosecutions under unconstitutional enactments, when the prevention of such prosecutions is essential to the safeguarding or rights of property,' we sustain the jurisdiction of the District Court. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 143\n, 44 S. Ct. 257, and cases there cited.\n The case was heard below by a statutory court of three judges and a decree rendered denying appellant's prayer for a temporary injunction and holding the statute assailed to be valid and constitutional. The provision of teh statute in question also has been upheld in a judgment of the New York state Court of Appeals (People v. Weller, 237 N. Y. 316, 143 N. E. 205, 38 A. L. R. 613) brought here on writ of error. That case, however, directly involved only section 168, requiring a license, and although it was insisted that section 172 restricting prices should also be considered, upon the ground that the two provisions were inseparable, this court held otherwise, sustained the validity of the license section and declined to \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 429]\n\u00a0\n pass upon the other one. Weller v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, 45 S. Ct. 556.\n Strictly, the question for determination relates only to the maximum price for which an entrance ticket to a theater, etc., may be resold. But the answer necessarily must be to a question of greater breadth. The statutory declaration (section 167) is that the price of or charge for admission to a theater, place of amusement or entertainment or other place where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held, is a matter affected with a public interest. To affirm the validity of section 172 is to affirm this declaration completely, since appellant's business embraces the resale of entrance tickets to all forms of entertainment therein enumerated. And since the ticket broker is a mere appendage of the theater, etc., and the price of or charge for admission is the essential element in the statutory declaration, it results that the real inquiry is whether every public exhibition, game, contest or performance, to which an admission charge is made, is clothed with a public interest, so as to authorize a law-making body to fix the maximum amount of the charge, which its patrons may be required to pay.\n In the endeavor to reach a correct conclusion in respect of this inquiry, it will be helpful, by way of preface, to state certain pertinent considerations. The first of these is that the right of the owner to fix a price at which his property shall be sold or used is an inherent attribute of the property itself, Case of the State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 278, and, as such, within the protection of the due process of law clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. See City of Carrollton v. Bazzette, 159 Ill. 284, 294, 42 N. E. 837, 31 L. R. A. 522. The power to regulate property, servicesOr business can be invoked only under special circumstances; and it does not follow that because the power may exist to regulate in some particulars it exists to regulate in others or in all.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 418, 430]\n\u00a0\n The authority to regulate the conduct of a business or to require a license, comes from a branch of the police power which may be quite distinct from the power to fix prices. The latter, ordinarily, does not exist in respect of merely private property or business, Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. v. Manning, \n186 \nU.S. 238, 246\n, 22 S. Ct. 881, but exists only where the business or the property involved has become 'affected with a public interest.' This phrase, first used by Lord Hale 200 years ago (Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 126), it is true, furnishes at best an indefinite standard, and attempts to define it have resulted, generally, in producing little more than paraphrases, which themselves require elucidation. Certain properties and kinds of business it obviously includes, like common carriers, telegraph and telephone companies, ferries, wharfage, etc. Beyond these, its application not only has not been uniform, but many of the decisions disclose the members of the same court in radical disagreement. Its full meaning, like that of many other generalizations, cannot be exactly defined-it can only be approximated.\n A business is not affected with a public interest merely because it is large or because the public are warranted in having a feeling of concern in respect of its maintenance. Nor is the interest meant such as arises from the mere fact that the public derives benefit, accommodation, ease, or enjoyment from the existence or operation of the business; and, while the word has not always been limited narrowly as strictly denoting 'a right,' that synonym more nearly than any other expresses the sense in which it is to be understood.\n The characterizations in some decisions of businesses as 'quasi public' (People v. King, 110 N. Y. 418, 428, 18 N. E. 245 1 L. R. A. 293, 6 Am. St. Rep. 389), 'not 'strictly' private' (Aaron v. Ward, 203 N. Y. 351, 356, 96 N. E. 736, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 204), and the like, while well enough for the purpose for which they were employed, namely, as a basis for upholding police regulations in respect of teh conduct of particular \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 431]\n\u00a0\n businesses, cannot be accepted as equivalents for the description 'affected with a public interest,' as that phrase is used in the decisions of this court as the basis for legislative regulation of prices. The latter power is not only a more definite and serious invasion of the rights of property and the freedom of contract, but its exercise cannot always be justified by circumstances which have been held to justify legislative regulation of the manner in which a business shall be carried on.\n And, finally, the mere declaration by the Legislature that a particular kind of property or business is affected with a public interest is not conclusive upon the question of the validity of the regulation. The matter is one which is always open to judicial inquiry. Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 536\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280\n\n\n In the Wolff Case, this court held invalid the wage fixing provision of the compulsory arbitration statute of Kansas as applied to a meat packing establishment. The power of a Legislature, under any circumstances, to fix prices or wages in the business of preparing and selling food was seriously doubted, but the court concluded that, even if the Legislature could do so in a public emergency, no such emergency appeared, and, in any event, the power would not extend to giving compulsory continuity to the business by compulsory arbitration. In the course of the opinion (page 535 ( 43 S. Ct. 632)), it was said that businesses characterized as clothed with a public interest might be divided into three classes:\n'(1) Those which are carried on under the authority of a public grant of privileges which either expressly or impliedly imposes the affirmative duty of rendering a public service demanded by any member of the public. Such are the railroads, other common carriers and public utilities.\n\n'(2) Certain occupations, regarded as exceptional, the public interest attaching to which recognized from earliest \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 432]\n\u00a0\n times, has survived the period of arbitrary laws by Parliament or colonial Legislatures for regulating all trades and callings. Such are those of the keepers of inns, cabs, and gristmills. State v. Edwards, 86 Me. 102 (29 A. 947, 25 L. R. A. 504, 41 Am. St. Rep. 528); Terminal taxicab Co. v. District of Columbia, \n241 U.S. 252\n, 254 (36 S. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765).\n\n'(3) Businesses which though not public at their inception may be fairly said to have risen to be such and have become subject in consequence to some government regulation. They have come to hold such a peculiar relation to the public that this is superimposed upon them. In the language of the cases, the owner by devoting his business to the public use, in effect grants the public an interest in that use and subjects himself to public regulation to the extent of that interest although the property continues to belong to its private owner and to be entitled to protection accordingly,'\n\n -citing the Munn Case and others.\n If the statute now under review can be sustained as valid, it must be in virtue of the doctrine laid down in the third paragraph; and it will aid in the effort to reach a correct conclusion in that respect if we shall first consider the principal decisions of this court where that doctrine has been applied. The leading, as well as the earliest, definite decision dealing with a business falling within that class is Munn v. Illinois, supra, which sustained the validity of an Illinois statute fixing the maximum charge to be made for the use of elevators and warehouses for the elevation and storage of grain.\n As ground for that decision the opinion recites, among other things, that grain came from the west and northwest by water and rail to Chicago where the greater part of it was shipped by vessel to the seaboard and some of it by railway to eastern ports; that Chicago had been made the greatest grain market in the world; and that the business had created a demand for means by which the immense quantity of grain could be handled or stored and these had been found in grain elevators. In this way the largest \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 433]\n\u00a0\n traffic between the country north and west of Chicago and that lying on the Atlantic Coast north of Washington, was in grain passing through the elevators at Chicago. The trade in grain between seven or eight of the great states of the west and four or five of those lying on the seashore formed the largest part of the interstate commerce in these states. The elevators in Chicago were immense structures, holding from 300,000 to 1, 000,000 bushels at one time. Under these circumstances, it was said that the elevators stood in the very 'gateway of commerce' and took toll from all who passed; that their business certainly tended to a common charge and had become a thing of public interest and use; that every bushel of grain for its passage paid a toll, which was a common charge; and, finally, that if any business could be clothed 'with a public interest, and cease to be juris privati only,' this had been made so by the facts.\n There is some general language in the opinion which, superficially, might seem broad enough to cover cases like the present one. It was said, for example (page 126 of 94 U. S.):\n'Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large.'\n\n Literally, that would include all the large industries and some small ones; but in accordance with the well-settled rule the words must be limited to the case under consideration. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399; Plumley v. Massachusetts, \n155 \nU.S. 461, 474\n, 15 S. Ct. 154. Indeed, the language quoted is qualified immediately by a statement of the general rule that:\n'When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of the interest he has thus created.'\n\n The significant requirement is that the property shall be devoted to a use in which the public has an interest, \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 434]\n\u00a0\n which simply means, as in terms it is expressed at page 130, of 94 U. S. that it shall be devoted to 'a public use.' Stated in another form, a business or property, in order to be affected with a public interest, must be such or be so employed as to justify the conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby, in effect granted to the public. See Louisville, etc., R. R. Co. v. West Coast Co., \n198 \nU.S. 483, 500\n, 25 S.Ct. 745. The subsequent elevator and warehouse cases, Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517\n, 12 S. Ct. 468, and Brass v. Stoeser, \n153 \nU.S. 391\n, 14 S. Ct. 857, while presenting conditions of less gravity, rest upon the authority of the Munn Case. The differences among the three cases are in matters of degree.\n In Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., \n183 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 22 S. Ct. 30, Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking on that point for himself and two other members of the court, said that, tested by the Munn Case, the stock-yards of the company, situated in one of the gateways of commerce and so located that they furnished important facilities to all seeking transportation of cattle, were subject to governmental price regulation. But the majority of the court, without referring to this view, assented to a reversal upon a ground specifically stated (pages 114, 115 ( 22 S. Ct. 30)); and the authority of the case must be limited by the terms of that statement.\n German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189, carries the doctrine further and marks the extreme limit to which this court thus far has gone in sustaining price fixing legislation. There the court said that a business might be affected with a public interest so as to permit price regulation although no public trust was impressed upon the property and although the public might not have a legal right to demand and receive service; and it was held that fire insurance was such a business. Mr. Justice McKenna, speaking for the court, pointed out that in an insurance business each risk was not individual; \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 435]\n\u00a0\n that 'there can be standards and classification of risks, determined by the law of averages,' and, while there might be variations, that rates are fixed and accommodated to such standards. Discussing the question whether the business was affected with a public interest so as to justify regulation of rates, it was then said (page 406 (34 S. Ct. 617)):\n'And we mean a broad and definite public interest. In some degree the public interest is concerned in every transaction between men, the sum of the transactions constituting the activities of life. But there is something more special than this, something of more definite consequence, which makes the public interest that justifies regulatory legislation.'\n\n The business of common carriers, transmission of intelligence, furnishing water and light, gas and electricty, were cited as examples, and the Munn, Budd, and Brass Cases reviewed. The fact that the contract of fire insurance was personal in character, it was said, did not preclude regulation, and in that connection it was pointed out that insurance companies were so regulated by state legislation as to show that the law- making bodies of the country, without exception, regarded the business of insurance as so far affecting the public welfare as to invoke and require governmental regulation. And it was then said (pages 412, 413 (34 S. Ct. 619)):\n'Accidental fires are inevitable and the extent of loss very great. The effect of insurance-indeed, it has been said to be its fundamental object-is to distribute the loss over as wide an area as possible. In other words, the loss is spread over the country, the disaster to an individual is shared by many, the disaster to a community shared by other communities; great catastrophes are thereby lessened, and, it may be, repaired. In assimilation of insurance to a tax, the companies have been said to be the mere machinery by which the inevitable losses by fire are distributed so as to fall as lightly as \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 436]\n\u00a0\n possible on the public at large, the body of the insured, not the companies, paying the tax.'\n\n And again (page 413 (34 S. Ct. 619)):\n'Contracts of insurance, therefore, have greater public consequence than contracts between individuals to do or not to do a particular thing whose effect stops with the individuals.'\n\n And again (page 414 (34 S. Ct. 620)):\n'We have shown that the business of insurance has very definite characteristics, with a reach of influence and consequence beyond and different from that of the ordinary businesses of the commercial world, to pursue which a greater liberty may be asserted. The transactions of the latter are independent and individual, terminating in their effect with the instances. The contracts of insurance may be said to be interdependent. They cannot be regarded singly, or isolatedly, and the effect of their relation is to create a fund of assurance and credit, the companies becoming the depositories of the money of the insured, possessing great power thereby and charged with great responsibility.'\n\n Answering the objection that the reasoning of the opinion would subject every act of human endeavor and the price of every article of human use to regulation, it was said (page 415 (34 S. Ct. 620)):\n'And both by the expression of the principle and the citation of the examples we have tried to confine our decision to the regulation of the business of insurance, it having become 'clothed with a public interest,' and therefore subject 'to be controlled by the public for the common good.\"\n\n This observation fairly may be regarded as a warning at least to be cautious about invoking the decision as a precedent for the determination of cases involving other kinds of business. And this view is borne out by a general consideration of the case. The decision proceeds \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 437]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that the insurance business is to be distinguished from ordinary private business; that an insurance company, in effect, is an instrumentality which gathers funds upon the basis of equality of risk from a great number of persons-sufficiently large in number to cause the element of chance to step out and the law of averages to step in as the controlling factor-and holds the numerous amounts so collected as a general fund to be paid out to those who shall suffer losses. Insurance companies do not sell commodities; they do not sell anything. They are engaged in making contracts with and collecting premiums from a large number of persons, the effect of their activities being to constitute a guaranty against individual loss and to put a large number of individual contributions into a common fund for the purpose of fulfilling the guaranty. In this fund all are interested, not in some vague or sentimental way, but in a very real, practical and definite sense. It was from the foregoing and other considerations peculiar to the insurance business that the court drew its conclusion that the business was clothed with a public interest.\n Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332\n, 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024 (involving the Adamson Law (39 Stat. 721 ), being Comp. St.  8680a-8680d), Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165, and Marcus Brown Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S. Ct. 465 (the rental cases), are relied upon to sustain the statute now under review. But in these cases the statutes involved were of a temporary character, to tide over grave emergencies, Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 U.S. 525\n, 551-552, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238, the emergency in the New Case being of nation-wide extent; and it is clear that, in the opinion of this court, at least the business of renting houses and apartments is not so affected with a public interest as to justify legislative fixing of prices unless some great emergency exists. Block v. Hirsh, supra, page 157 (41 S. Ct. 458); Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543, 548\n, 44 S. Ct. 405. And, even with the emergency, the stat- \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 438]\n\u00a0\n ues 'went to the verge of the law.' Penna. Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 416\n, 43 S. Ct. 158, 28 A. L. R. 1321.\n Nor is the sale of ordinary commodities of trade affected with a public interest so as to justify legislative price fixing. This court said in Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, supra, page 537 (43 S. Ct. 633):\n'It has never been supposed, since the adoption of the Constitution, that the business of the butcher, or the baker, or the tailor, the wood chopper, the mining operator or the miner was clothed with such a public interest that the price of his product or his wages could be fixed by state regulation. It is true that in the days of the early common law an omnipotent Parliament did regulate prices and wages as it chose, and occasionally a colonial Legislature sought to exercise the same power; but nowadays one does not devote one's property or business to the public use or clothe it with a public interest merely because one makes commodities for, and sells to, the public in the common callings of which those above mentioned are instances.'\n\n See, also, United States v. Bernstein (D. C.) 267 F. 295, 296.\n From the foregoing review it will be seen that each of the decisions of this court upholding governmental price regulation, aside from cases involving legislation to tide over temporary emergencies, has turned upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration, which bore such a substantial and definite relation to the public interest as to justify an indulgence of the legal fiction of a grant by the owner to the public of an interest in the use.\n Lord Hale's statement that, when private property is 'affected with a public interest, it ceases to be juris privati only,' is accepted by this court as the guiding principle in cases of this character. That this phrase was not intended by its author to include private undertakings, like those enumerated in the statute now under consid- \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 439]\n\u00a0\n eration, is apparent when we consider the connection in which it was used. It occurs in Lord Hale's manuscript, De Portibus Maries, 1 Harg. Law Tracts, 78, in which the three-fold rights of the proprietor, the public and the king in ports are considered. It first is pointed out that no man can erect a public port without the king's license, though if he set up a port for his private advantage he may take what rates he and his customers can agree upon. But, it is said, if the king or the subject have a public wharf, to which all persons must come, because it is the wharf only licensed by the king, or there is no other wharf in that port, arbitrary and excessive charges cannot be made. For it is then affected with a public interest and ceases to be juris privati only; 'as if a man set out a street in new building on his own land, it is now no longer bare private interest, but it is affected with a public interest.'\n It is clear that, as there announced, the rule is confined to conveniences made public because the privilege of maintaining them has been granted by the government or because there has arisen what may be termed a constructive grant of the use to the public. That this is what Lord Hale had in mind is borne out, and the question now under consideration is illuminated, by the illustration, which he evidently conceived to be pertinent, of a street opened to the public, in which case the assumed grant and resulting public right of use is very apparent.\n A theater or other place of entertainment does not meet this conception of Lord Hale's aphorism or fall within the reasons of the decisions of this court based upon it. A theater is a private enterprise, which, in its relation to the public, differs obviously and widely, both in character and degree, from a grain elevator, standing at the gateway of commerce and exacting toll, amounting to a common charge, for every bushel of grain which passes on its way among the states; or stockyards, standing in \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 440]\n\u00a0\n like relation to the commerce in live stock; or an insurance company, engaged, as a sort of common agency, in collecting and holding a guaranty fund in which definite and substantial rights are enjoyed by a considerable portion of the public sustaining interdependent relations in respect of their interests in the fund. Sales of theater tickets bear no relation to the commerce of the country, and they are not interdependent transactions, but stand, both in form and effect, separate and apart from each other, 'terminating in their effect with the instances.' And certainly a place of entertainment is in no legal sense a public utility; and quite as certainly its activities are not such that their enjoyment can be regarded under any conditions from the point of view of an emergency.\n The interest of the public in theaters and other places of entertainment may be more nearly, and with better reason, assimilated to the like interest in provision stores and markets, and in the rental of houses and apartments for residence purposes, although in importance it falls below such an interest in the proportion that food and shelter are of more moment than amusement or instruction. As we have shown, there is no legislative power to fix the prices of provisions or clothing or the rental charges for houses or apartments, in the absence of some controlling emergency; and we are unable to perceive any dissimilarities of such quality or degree as to justify a different rule in respect of amusements and entertainments.\n A theater ticket may be in the form of a revocable license or of a contract. If the former, it may be revoked at the will of the proprietor; if the latter, it may be made nontransferable or otherwise conditioned. A theater, of course, may be regulated so as to preserve the public peace, insure good order, protect public morals, and the like. A license may be required, but such a license is \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 441]\n\u00a0\n not a franchise, which puts the proprietor under the duty of furnishing entertainment to the public, or, if furnished, of admitting every one who applies. See Collister v. Hayman, 183 N. Y. 250, 253, 76 N. E. 20, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1188, 111 Am. St. Rep. 740, 5 Ann. Cas. 344. How far the power of the Legislature may be exerted to prevent discriminating selection by the proprietor of his patrons upon the basis of race, color, creed, etc. ( People v. King, 110 N. Y. 418, 18 N. E. 245, 1 L. R. A. 293, 6 Am. St. Rep. 389), need not be determined; for in any event such power and the other powers of regulation just enumerated fall far short of the one here invoked to fix prices.\n The contention that, historically considered, places of entertainment may be regarded as so affected with a public interest as to justify legislative regulation of their charges, does not seem to us impressive. It may be true, as asserted, that, among the Greeks, amusement and instruction of the people through the drama was one of the duties of government. But certainly no such duty devolves upon any American government. The most that can be said is that the theater and other places of entertainment, generally have been regarded as of high value to the people, to be encouraged, but, at the same time, regulated, within limits already stated. While theaters have existed for centuries and have been regulated in a variety of ways, and while price fixing by legislation is an old story, it does not appear that any attempt hitherto has been made to fix their charges by law. This is a fact of some significance in connection with the historical argument, and, when set in contrast with the practice in respect of innkeepers and others, whose charges have been subjected to legislative regulation from a very early period, it persuasively suggests that by general legislative acquiescence theaters, historically, have been regarded as falling outside the classes of things which should be thus controlled. It will not do to say that this failure of legislative bodies to act in the matter has been due to the absence of complaints on the part of the public, \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 442]\n\u00a0\n for it hardly is probable that a privilege as ancient and as amply exercised as that of complaining about prices in general, has not been freely indulged in the matter of charges for entertainment. Indeed, it is judicially recorded that, as long ago as 1809, there was a riot in the Royal Theater, London, for the purpose of compelling a reduction in prices of admission. In deciding a case growing out of the disturbance, Clifford v. Brandon, 2 Campb. 358, 368, the court summarily disposed of the claim that people had a right to express their disapprobation of high prices in such a tumultuous manner, by saying that 'the proprietors of a theater have a right to manage their property in their own way, and to fix what prices of admission they think most for their own advantage,' and that any person who did not approve could stay away.\n If it be within the legitimate authority of government to fix maximum charges for admission to theaters, lectures (where perhaps the lecturer alone is concerned), baseball, football, and other games of all degrees of interest, circuses, shows (big and little), and every possible form of amusement, including the lowly merry-go-round with its adjunct, the hurdy- gurdy (Commonwealth v. Bow, 177 Mass. 347, 58 N. E. 1017), it is hard to see where the limit of power in respect of price fixing is to be drawn.\n It is urged that the statutory provision under review may be upheld as an appropriate method of preventing fraud, extortion, collusive arrangements between the management and those engaged in reselling tickets, and the like. That such evils exist in some degree in connection with the theatrical business and its ally, the ticket broker, is undoubtedly true, as it unfortunately is true in respect of the same or similar evils in other kinds of business. But evils are to be suppressed or prevented by legislation which comports with the Constitution, and not by such as strikes down those essential rights of private property protected by that instrument against undue governmental \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 443]\n\u00a0\n interference. One vice of the contention is that the statute itself ignores the righteous distinction between guilt and innocence, since it applies wholly irrespective of the existence of fraud, collusion, or extortion (if that word can have any legal significance as applied to transactions of the kind here dealt with, Commonwealth v. O'Brien and others, 12 Cush. (Mass.) 84, 90), and fixes the resale price as well where the evils are absent as where they are present. It is not permissible to enact a law which, in effect, spreads an all-inclusive net for the feet of everybody upon the chance that, while the innocent will surely be entangled in its meshes, some wrongdoers also may be caught.\n What this court said in Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590, 594\n, 37 S. Ct. 662, 664 (61 L. Ed. 1336, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 973) in the course of its opinion holding invalid a statute of Washington penalizing the collection of fees for securing employment, is apposite:\n'Because abuses may, and probably do, grow up in connection with this business, is adequate reason for hedging it about by proper regulations. But this is not enough to justify destruction of one's right to follow a distinctly useful calling in an upright way. Certainly there is no profession, possibly no business, which does not offer peculiar opportunities for reprehensible practices; and as to every one of them, no doubt, some can be found quite ready earnestly to maintain that its suppression would be in the public interest. Skillfully directed agitation might also bring about apparent condemnation of any one of them by the public. Happily for all, the fundamental guaranties of the Constitution cannot be freely submerged if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced and the police power invoked.'\n\n The evil of collusive alliances between the proprietors of theaters and ticket brokers or scalpers seems to have been effectively dealt with in Illinois by an ordinance \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 444]\n\u00a0\n which required (1) that the price of every theater ticket shall be printed on its face and (2) that no proprietor, employee, etc., of a theater shall receive or enter into any arrangement or agreement to receive more. This ordinance was sustained as valid by the state Supreme Court in People v. Thompson, 283 Ill. 87, 97, 119 N. E. 41, L. R. A. 1918D, 382, and that decision is cited here in support of the present statute. But the important distinction between that case and this is that the ordinance did not forbid the resale of the ticket by a purchaser of it for any price he was able to secure, or forbid the fixing of any price by the proprietor which he thought fit, provided that price was printed on the face of the ticket.\n That court had held in the earlier case of People v. Steele, 231 Ill. 340, 344, 83 N. E. 236, 14 L. R. A. (N. S.) 361, 121 Am. St. Rep. 321, that the business of conducting a theater was a private one; that the Legislature had the power to regulate it as a place of public amusement and might require a license; that the Legislature had the same power to regulate such a business as it had to regulate any other private business, and no more. And an act which prohibited the resale of tickets for more than the price printed thereon was held to be invalid as an arbitrary and unreasonable interference with the rights of the ticket broker. It was distinctly held that the intending purchaser of the ticket had no right to buy at any price except that fixed by the holder; that the manager might fix the price arbitrarily, and raise or lower it at his will; that having advertised a performance, he was not bound to give it, and, having advertised a price, he was not bound to sell at that price; and that the business of dealing in theater tickets and the right to contract with regard to them were entitled to protection. To the same effect, see Ex parte Quarg, 149 Cal. 79, 84 P. 766, 5 L. R. A. (N. S.) 183, 117 Am. St. Rep. 115, 9 Ann. Cas. 747.\n This doctrine was reaffirmed in the Thompson Case, but held to have no application to the ordinance there considered and not to be inconsistent with the holding (page 97 (119 N. E. 45)) \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 445]\n\u00a0\n that the manager of a place of public entertainment might 'be compelled to treat patrons impartially by putting an end to an existing system by which theater owners and ticket scalpers are confederated together to compel a portion of the public to pay a different price from others.'\n It should not be difficult similarly to define and penalize in specific terms other practices of a fraudulent character, the existence or apprehension of which is suggested in brief and argument. But the difficulty or even the impossibility of thus dealing with the evils, if that should be conceded. Constitutes no warrant for suppressing them by methods preclude by the Constitution. Such subversions are not only illegitimate, but are fraught with the danger that, having begun on the ground of necessity, they will continue on the score of expediency, and, finally, as a mere matter of course. Constitutional principles, applied as they are written, it must be assumed, operate justly and wisely as a general thing, and they may not be remolded by lawmakers or judges to save exceptional cases of inconvenience, hardship or injustice.\n We are of opinion that the statute assailed contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment and that the decree must be\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n We fear to grant power and are unwilling to recognize it when it exists. The States very generally have stripped jury trials of one of their most important characteristics by forbidding the judges to advise the jury upon the facts (Graham v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 474, 480\n, 34 S. Ct. 148), and when Legislatures are held to be authorized to do anything considerably affecting public welfare it is covered by apologetic phrases like the police power, or the statement that the business concerned has been dedicated to a public use. The former expression is convenient, to be sure, to conciliate the mind to something that needs explanation; the fact that the constitutional requirement of compensation \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 446]\n\u00a0\n when property is taken cannot be pressed to its grammatical extreme; that property rights may be taken for public purposes without pay if you do not take too much; that some play must be allowed to the joints if the machine is to work. But police power often is used in a wide sense to cover and, as I said, to apologize for the general power of the Legislature to make a part of the community uncomfortable by a change.\n I do not believe in such apologies. I think the proper course is to recognize that a state Legislature can do whatever it sees fit to do unless it is restrained by some express prohibition in the Constitution of the United States or of the State, and that Courts should be careful not to extend such prohibitions beyond their obvious meaning by reading into them conceptions of public policy that the particular Court may happen to entertain. Coming down to the case before us I think, as I intimated in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 569\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238, that the notion that a business is clothed with a public interest and has been devoted to the public use is little more than a fiction intended to beautify what is disagreeable agreeable to the sufferers. The truth seems to me to be that, subject to compensation when compensation is due, the Legislature may forbid or restrict any business when it has a sufficient force of public opinion behind it. Lotteries were thought useful adjuncts of the State a century or so ago; now they are believed to be immoral and they have been stopped. Wine has been thought good for man from the time of the Apostles until recent years. But when public opinion changed it did not need the Eighteenth Amendment, notwithstanding the Fourteenth, to enable a State to say that the business should end. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S. Ct. 273. What has happened to lotteries and wine might happen to theaters in some moral storm of the future, not because theaters were devoted to a public use, but because people had come to think that way. \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 447]\n\u00a0\n But if we are to yield to fashionable conventions, it seems to me that theaters are as much devoted to public use as anything well can be. We have not that respect for art that is one of the glories of France. But to many people the superfluous is the necessary, and it seems to me that Government does not go beyond its sphere in attempting to make life livable for them. I am far from saying that I think this particular law a wise and rational provision. That is not my affair. But if the people of the State of New York speaking by their authorized voice say that they want it, I see nothing in the Constitution of the United States to prevent their having their will.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I can agree with the majority that 'constitutional principles, applied as they are written, it must be assumed, operate justly and wisely as a general thing, and they may not be remolded by lawmakers or judges to save exceptional cases of inconvenience, hardship, or injustice.' But I find nothing written in the Constitution, and nothing in the case or common law development of the Fourteenth Amendment, which would lead me to conclude that the type of regulation attempted by the state of New York is prohibited.\n The scope of our inquiry has been repeatedly defined by the decisions of this court. As was said in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 132 (24 L. Ed. 77) by Chief Justice Waite:\n'For us the question is one of power, not of expediency. If no state of circumstances could exist to justify such a statute, then we may declare this one void, because in excess of the legislative power of the state. But if it could, we must presume it did. Of the propriety of legislative interference within the scope of legislative power, the Legisla- \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 448]\n\u00a0\n ture is the exclusive judge.'\n\n The attitude in which we should approach new problems in the field of price regulation was indicated in German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 409\n, 34 S. Ct. 612, 618 (58 L. Ed. 1011, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189):\n'Against that conservatism of the mind, which puts to question every new act of regulating legislation and regards the legislation invalid or dangerous until it has become familiar, government-state and national-has pressed on in the general welfare; and our reports are full of cases where in instance after instance the exercise of regulation was resisted and yet sustained against attacks asserted to be justified by the Constitution of the United States. The dread of the moment having passed, no one is now heard to say that rights were restrained or their constitutional guarantees impaired.'\n\n Again, in sustaining the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance under the Fourteenth Amendment, this court has recently said:\n'Regulations, the wisdom, necessity, and validity of which, as applied to existing conditions, are so apparent that they are now uniformly sustained, a century ago, or even half a century ago, probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive.' Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 398\n, 47 S. Ct. 114.\n\n The question with which we are here concerned is much narrower than the one which has been principally discussed by the court. It is not whether there is constitutional power to fix the price which theater owners and producers may charge for admission. Although the statute in question declares that the price of tickets of admission to places of amusement is affected with a public interest, it does not purport to fix prices of admission. The producer or theater proprietor is free to charge any price he chooses. The statute requires only that the sale price, whatever it is, be printed on the face of the ticket, and prohibits the licensed ticket broker, an intermediary \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 449]\n\u00a0\n in the marketing process, from reselling the ticket at an advance of more than 50 cents above the printed price. \n2\n Nor is it contended that this limit on the profit is unreasonable. It appears affirmatively that the business is now being carried on profitably by ticket brokers under this very restriction. But if it were not, there could be judicial relief without affecting the constitutionality of the measure. In these respects, the case resembles Munn v. Illinois, supra, where the attempt was not to fix the price of grain but to fix the price of the service rendered by the proprietors of grain elevators in connection with the transportation and distribution of grain, the cost of which entered into the price ultimately paid by the consumer. The statute there, as the statute here, was designed in part to protect a large class of consumers from \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 450]\n\u00a0\n exorbitant prices made possible by the strategic position of a group of intermediaries in the distribution of a product from producer to consumer.\n There are about 60 first-class theaters in the borough of Manhattan. Brokers annually sell about 2,000,000 tickets, principally for admission to these theaters. Appellant sells 300,000 tickets annually. The practice of the brokers, as revealed by the record, is to subscribe, in advance of the production of the play and frequently before the cast is chosen, for tickets covering a period of eight weeks. The subscriptions must be paid two weeks in advance and about 25 per cent. of the tickets unsold may be returned. A virtual monopoly of the best seats, usually the first 15 rows, is thus acquired, and the brokers are enabled to demand extortionate prices of theater goers. Producers and theater proprietors are eager to make these advance sales, which are an effective insurance against loss arising from unsuccessful productions. The brokers are in a position to prevent the direct purchase of tickets to the desirable seats and to exact from the patrons of the successful productions a price sufficient to pay the loss of those which are unsuccessful, plus an excessive profit to the broker.\n It is undoubtedly true as a general proposition that one of the incidents of the ownership of property is the power to fix the price at which it may be disposed. It may be also assumed that as a general proposition, under the decisions of this court, the power of state governments to regulate and control prices may be invoked only in special and not well defined circumstances. But when that power is invoked in the public interest and in consequence of the gross abuse of private right disclosed by this record, we should make searching and critical examination of those circumstances which in the past have been deemed sufficient to justify the exercise of the power, before concluding that it may not be exercised here. \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 451]\n\u00a0\n The phrase 'business affected with a public interest' seems to me to be too vague and illusory to carry us very far on the way to a solution. It tends in use to become only a convenient expression for describing those businesses, regulation of which has been permitted in the past. To say that only those businesses affected with a public interest may be regulated is but another way of stating that all those businesses which may be regulated are affected with a public interest. It is difficult to use the phrase free of its connotation of legal consequences and hence when used as a basis of judicial decision, to avoid begging the question to be decided. The very fact that it has been applied to businesses unknown to Lord Hale, who gave sanction to its use, should caution us against the assumption that the category has now become complete or fixed and that there may not be brought into it new classes of business or transactions not hitherto included, in consequence of newly devised methods of extortionate price exaction.\n The constitutional theory that prices normally may not be regulated rests upon the assumption that the public interest and private right are both adequately protected when there is 'free' competition among buyers and sellers, and that in such a state of economic society, the interference with so important an incident of the ownership of private property as price fixing is not justified and hence is a taking of property without due process of law.\n Statutory regulation of price is commonly directed toward the prevention of exorbitant demands of buyers or sellers. An examination of the decisions of this court in which price regulation has been upheld will disclose that the element common to all is the existence of a situation or a combination of circumstances materially restricting the regulative force of competition, so that buyers or sellers are placed at such a disadvantage in the \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 452]\n\u00a0\n bargaining struggle that serious economic consequences result to a very large number of members of the community. Whether this situation arises from the monopoly conferred upon public service companies or from the circumstance that the strategical position of a group is such as to enable it to impose its will in matters of price upon those who sell, buy or consume, as in Munn v. Illinois, supra; or from the predetermination of prices in the councils of those who sell, promulgated in schedules of practically controlling constancy, as in German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, supra; or from a housing shortage growing out of a public emergency as in Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165; Marcus Brown Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S. Ct. 465; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S. Ct. 289 (cf. Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n, 44 S. Ct. 405)-the result is the same. Self-interest is not permitted to invoke constitutional protection at the expense of the public interest and reasonable regulation of price is upheld.\n That should be the result here. We need not attempt to lay down any universal rule to apply to new and unknown situations. It is enough for present purposes that this case falls within the scope of the earlier decisions and that the exercise of legislative power now considered was not arbitrary.

Nor is the exercise of the power less reasonable because the interests protected are in some degree less essential to life than some others. Laws against monopoly which aim at the same evil and accomplish their end by interference with private rights quite as much as the present law are not regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable or unconstitutional because they are not limited in their application to dealings in the bare necessities of life.\n The problem sought to be dealt with has been the subject of earlier legislation in New York and has engaged the attention of the legislators of other states. \n3\n That it is \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 454]\n\u00a0\n one involving serious injustice to great numbers of individuals who are powerless to protect themselves cannot be questioned. Its solution turns upon considerations of economics about which there may be reasonable differences of opinion. Choice between these views takes us from the judicial to the legislative field. The judicial function ends when it is determined that there is basis for legislative action in a field not withheld from legislative power by the Constitution as interpreted by the decisions of this court. Holding these views, I believe the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS join in this dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD, dissenting.\n I regret that I cannot agree with the opinion of the Court in this case. My own view is more nearly that expressed by Mr. Justice STONE. Shortly stated, it is this: The case, I think, does not involve the question whether the business of theater owners offering their separate entertainments is so affected with a public interest that the price which they themselves charge for tickets is subject to regulation by the Legislature, but the very different question whether the business of ticket brokers who intervene between the theater owners and the general public in the sale of theater tickets is affected with a public interest, and may, under the circumstances disclosed in this case, be \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 455]\n\u00a0\n regulated by the Legislature to the extent of preventing them from selling tickets at more than a reasonable advance upon the theater prices. The facts stated by Mr. Justice STONE are substantially those found by the District Court. They show, as I think, clearly, that the ticket brokers, by virtue or arrangements which they make with the theater owners, ordinarily acquire an absolute control of the most desirable seats in the theaters, by which they deprive the public of access to the theaters themselves for the purpose of buying such tickets at the regular prices, and are enabled to exact an extortionate advance in prices for the sale of such tickets to the public.\n In Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 132-although there was no holding that the sale of grain was in itself a business affected with a public interest which could be regulated by the Legislature-it was held that the separate business of grain elevators, which 'stood in the very gateway of commerce' in grain, 'taking toll' from all who passed and tending to a common charge, had become, by the facts, clothed 'with a public interest' and was subject to public regulation limiting the charges to a reasonable toll. So, I think, that here-without reference to the character of the business of the theaters themselves-the business of the ticket brokers, who stand in 'the very gateway' between the theaters and the public, depriving the public of access to the theaters for the purchase of desirable seats at the regular prices, and exacting toll from patrons of the theaters desiring to purchase such seats, has become clothed with a public interest and is subject to regulation by the Legislature limiting their charges to reasonable exactions and protecting the public from extortion and exorbitant rates. See People v. Weller, 207 App. Div. 337, 343, 202 N. Y. S. 149, and 237 N. Y. 316, 331, 143 N. E. 205, 38 A. L. R. 613, in which the constitutionality of this statute was sustained by the New York courts; and Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, 247 Mass. 589, 598, 143 N. E. 808. And in Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 535\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280, it was recognized that a business, \n\n[273 U.S. 418, 456]\n\u00a0\n although not public at its inception, might become clothed with a public interest justifying some government regulation, by coming 'to hold such a peculiar relation to the public that this is superimposed' upon it. This, I think, is the case here. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 167. Matters of Public Interest. It is hereby determined and declared that the price of or charge for admission to theaters, places of amusement or entertainment, or other places where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held is a matter affected with a public interest and subject to the supervision of the state for the purpose of safeguarding the public against fraud, extortion, exorbitant rates and similar abuses.\n Sec. 172. Restriction as to Price. No licensee shall resell any such ticket or other evidence of the right of entry to any theater, place of amusement or entertainment, or other place where public exhibitions, games, contests, or performances are given at a price in excess of fifty cents in advance of the price printed on the face of such ticket or other evidence of the right to entry. Every person, firm or corporation who owns, operates or controls a theater, place of amusement or entertainment, or other place where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held shall, if a price be charged for admission thereto, print on the face of each such ticket or other evidence of the right of entry the price charged therefor by such person, firm, or corporation. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Turning to the broader question, the public importance of theaters has been manifested in regulatory legislation in this country from the earliest times.

TARIFF(1927)\nNo. 91\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George R. Davis and Marion De Vries, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., and Robert P. Reeder, both of Washington, D. C. for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Tariff Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356,  315, 42 Stat. 858, 941 (Comp. St.  5841c19-5841c24), vested in the President the power to adjust tariff duties, so as to equalize differences in costs of production here and abroad of articles wholly or in part the growth or product of this county, whenever an investigation by the Tariff Commission should reveal disparate costs. Such investigation is made a prerequisite to action by the President in proclaiming changes of rates. By executive order of October 7, 1922, it was provided that all petitions or applications for action or relief under the so-called flexible sections of the Tariff Act of 1922 should be filed with the Tariff Commission.\n In October, 1922, the American Nitrogen Products Company, a corporation of the state of Washington, filed with the United States Tariff Commission a petition praying for a 50 per cent. increase in the duty imposed by the Tariff Act of 1922 upon imported sodium nitrite. The following March the Tariff Commission, for the purpose of assisting the President in the exercise of the powers delegated to him by the act of 1922, ordered an investigation of the differences in cost of production of sodium nitrite at home and abroad, and of other pertinent facts and conditions. It was further ordered that all parties interested should be given an opportunity to be \n\n[274 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n present and produce evidence at a public hearing to be held at a date to be fixed later.\n Plaintiff in error is engaged in the importation of nitrogen products into the United States, which it sells on commission. It represents in the United States as exclusive agent the Norwegian Hydro-Electric Nitrogen Corporation, the only manufacturer of sodium nitrite in Norway. Representatives of the commission in the course of its investigation proceeded to Norway and Germany, and sought from the Norwegian company and from German manufacturers data showing the cost of production of sodium nitrite in those countries. This was refused. The commission's experts were permitted to examine the books and records of American manufacturers, obtaining information of the domestic cost of production and other relevant data. This information was given under promise that it should be treated as confidential and upon the assurance that the rules of the commission and section 708 of the Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 798 (Comp. St.  5326i), so required. Section 708 prohibits the commission from revealing 'the trade secrets or processes' of which it might learn in the course of its investigations.\n After making its investigation, the commission ordered a public hearing to be held on September 10, 1926. Its rules provided that:\n'Parties who have entered appearances shall, prior to the filing of briefs, have opportunity to examine the report of the commissioner or investigator in charge of the investigation and also the record except such portions as relate to trade secrets and processes.'\n\n At the hearing, plaintiff appeared by counsel and demanded a complete copy of the application of the American Nitrogen Products Company and attempted to cross examine its president as to its cost of production. In making these and other similar demands in the course of the hearings, plaintiff relied on the provisions of section 315(c) of the Act of 1922 ( Comp. St.  5841c21), reading in part:\n'The commission \n\n[274 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n shall give reasonable public notice of its hearings and shall give reasonable opportunity to parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard. The commission is authorized to adopt such reasonable procedure, rules, and regulations as it may deem necessary.'\n\n The commission, holding that its action was controlled by section 708 of the Revenue Act of 1916, prohibiting it from divulging trade secrets or processes of which it acquired information in the course of investigation, excluded the questions asked and disclosed only a copy of the application of the American company, from which a statement of its costs of production had been deleted. On September 15, 1923, the commission made a preliminary report stating the results of its inquiry. The report contained a review of the data in the possession of the commission, including an estimate of the cost of production in Norway, based upon such public sources in Norway as were available to it; both the Norwegian company and the plaintiff having refused to give any information on the subject. But, following its settled policy, it withheld all material which would reveal the individual production costs of American manufacturers. Its practice is to publish the average domestic cost, but this was withheld here, because the average cost was deemed informative of individual costs, in view of the small number of American manufacturers. Hearings were resumed on September 26, at which plaintiff was given an opportunity to offer evidence, to make oral argument and to file briefs. Requests by plaintiff to cross-examine the commission's field examiners and experts and to inspect data gathered by them were refused.\n Plaintiff then filed with the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia a petition for mandamus, directing the Tariff Commission to disclose the information which it had obtained concerning the cost of production of sodium nitrite by American and foreign manufacturers, and \n\n[274 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n directing the commissioners to hold a public hearing at which plaintiff should be given an opportunity to cross examine the investigators and experts of the commission, and witnesses with respect to such data, to offer evidence in opposition, and to present arguments against the American company's petition. The commission interposed an answer setting up that section 708 of the Revenue Act forbade the Tariff Commission from disclosing the information sought. To this answer the plaintiff demurred. The demurrer was overruled, and final judgment was entered dismissing the petition.\n Pending review by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, the commission completed and submitted its report to the President. On May 6, 1924, the President made proclamation reciting the investigation of the committee and fixing the duty at a rate found necessary to equalize the cost of production of sodium nitrite at home and abroad. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, holding that the case had become moot by the action of the President in fixing the new rate of duty. Notwithstanding this determination, it reviewed the case at length and announced its conclusion on the merits. 55 App. D. C. 366, 6 F.(2d) 491.\n The case is properly here on writ of error, under section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227), before the amendment of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 941); defendant in error having by its answer drawn in question the construction of section 708 of the Revenue Act. Santa Fe Pac. R. R. v. Work, \n267 \nU.S. 511\n, 45 S. Ct. 400; Brady v. Work, \n263 \nU.S. 435\n, 44 S. Ct. 168; Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, \n270 \nU.S. 117\n, 46 S. Ct. 215.\n We conclude that the case had become moot before the review below and that it is unnecessary for us to indulge in a discussion of the merits. Under section 315, subds. (c) and (e) of the Tariff Act of 1922 (Comp. St .  5841c21, 5841c23), the President is given authority to require an investigation by the commission and it is its duty to make one when so required. \n\n[274 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n There is no other provision of the act placing any duty on the commission to make such an investigation. When not so requested by the President, action by the commission is discretionary. Under its rules, it is optional with it whether it will employ its resources for investigations sought by an interested party. Section 703 of the Revenue Act of September 8, 1916 ( Comp. St.  5326d), under which the commission was created, requires it to make certain specified studies of the administration and operation of the tariff laws of the United States and tariff relations of the United States with foreign countries, on request of the President and certain committees of the two houses of Congress. That act has no relevancy here, since, unlike the act of 1922, it contains no provisions for hearings in conjunction with the investigations there authorized.\n All relief sought here is incidental to the hearing before the commission on the cost of production of sodium nitrite. The commission conducted its inquiry and held these hearings to aid the President in determining whether the difference in cost of that product in this and in foreign countries should be equalized by revising the tariff under section 315(a) of the act of 1922 (Comp. St.  5841c19). The hearing pending when the plaintiff's petition was filed has been concluded, as it lawfully might, since there was no injunction or restraining order and the commission's action was taken after the determination of the Supreme Court of the District in its favor. We need not consider here the effect upon judicial review of an attempt to evade or forestall a decision adverse to the commission. The commission has filed its report with the President, and the President has made his decision and proclamation fixing the revised tariff. Either may revive the investigation, but neither is under a duty to do so. Assuming that the plaintiff is entitled to a hearing of the character demanded whenever an investiga- \n\n[274 U.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n tion is had, which we do not decide, it would be an idle ceremony to require such a hearing upon an investigation which we may not command and which may never be made. In such circumstances there can be no effectual relief by mandamus and the Court of Appeals should have remanded the cause with directions to dismiss the petition as moot. Brownlow v. Schwartz, \n261 \nU.S. 216\n, 43 S. Ct. 263; Mills v. Green, \n159 \nU.S. 651, 653\n, 16 S. Ct. 132.\n The argument is made that the President was without jurisdiction to proclaim the new tariff rate because of alleged irregularities in the conduct of the hearing before the commission which was a prerequisite to such action by the President. But petitioner does not attack the validity of the tariff proclaimed by the President, nor is this an appropriate proceeding in which to do so. Even if the change in tariff rates were deemed to be ineffectual, it would not follow that it is mandatory upon the President or the commission to institute a new hearing.\n The judgments of the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia are vacated, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the petition as moot.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.

It was dismissed by the District Court for lack of jurisdiction, 291 F. 92, and the decree having been entered on March 17, 1925, before the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 14, 43 Stat. 936, 938, 942, went into effect, a direct appeal was taken to this Court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). The Ira M. Hedges, \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S. Ct. 17, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235\n\n\n The United States, owner of the Steamship Mount Shasta, in May, 1920, made a bare boat charter of the vessel to the Mount Shasta Steamship Company through Victor S. Fox and Company, Inc., an agent of that Company, stipulating for a lien upon all cargoes and all sub-freights for any amounts due under the charter party. Victor S. Fox & Company in July, 1920, made a subcharter to Palmer & Parker Company for a voyage to bring a cargo of mahogany logs from the Gold Coast, Africa, to Boston. The vessel arrived in Boston with its cargo on February 19, 1921. There is due to the libellant $289,680 for the hire of the steamship, and the libel alleges that there is due and unpaid freight on the cargo of logs, $100,000, more or less, in the hands of Palmer & Parker Company, on which this libel seeks to establish a lien. It prays a monition against Palmer & Parker Company and all persons interested, commanding payment of the freight money into Court, etc. Palmer & \n\n[274 U.S. 466, 470]\n\u00a0\n Parker Company was served. That Company filed exceptions to the libel, denied the jurisdiction of the Court and answered alleging ignorance of the original charter party and of the relations of the United States and the Mount Shasta S. S. Company to the vessel, and setting up counterclaims more than sufficient to exhaust the freight. The cargo had been delivered. The District Court assumed that a libel in rem could be maintained against freight money admitted to be due and payable, but was of opinion that the fund must exist when the suit is begun, or that the jurisdiction fails. The Court held that where, as here, the liability was denied in good faith, it did not appear that there was any res to be proceeded against and that the suit must be dismissed. The counsel for Palmer & Parker Company pressed the same considerations here in a somewhat more extreme form.\n By the general logic of the law a debt may be treated as a res as easily as a ship. It is true that it is not tangible, but it is a right of the creditor's, capable of being attached and appropriated by the law to the creditor's duties. The ship is a res not because it is tangible but because it is a focus of rights that in like manner may be dealt with by the law. It is no more a res than a copyright. How far in fact the admiralty has carried its proceeding in rem is a question of tradition. We are not disposed to disturb what we take to have been the understanding of the Circuit Courts for a good many years, and what the District court assumed. American Steel Barge Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Coal Agency Co. (C. C. A.) 115 F. 669; Bank of British North America v. Freights of the Hutton ( C. C. A.) 137 F. 534, 538; Larsen v. 150 Bales of Sisal Grass (D. C.) 147 F. 783, 785; Freights of the Kate (D. C.) 63 F. 707.\n But if it be conceded that the Admiralty Court has jurisdiction to enforce a lien on sub-freights by a proceeding in rem, and a libel is filed alleging such sub-freights \n\n[274 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n to be outstanding, we do not perceive how the Court can be deprived of jurisdiction merely by an answer denying that such freights are due. The jurisdiction is determined by the allegations of the libel. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Rice, \n247 \nU.S. 201, 203\n, 38 S. Ct. 429. It may be defeated upon the trial by proof that the res does not exist. But the allegation of facts that if true make out a case entitles the party making them to have the acts tried. It is said that the Court derives its jurisdiction from its power, and no doubt its jurisdiction ultimately depends on that. But the jurisdiction begins before actual seizure, and authorizes a warrant to arrest, which may or may not be successful. Here the debtor is within the power of the Court and therefore the debt, if there is one, is also within it. The Court has the same jurisdiction to try the existence of the debt that it has to try the claim of the libellant for the hire of the Mount Shasta. If the proof that there is freight due shall fail it does not matter very much whether it be called proof that the Court had no jurisdiction or proof that the plaintiff had no case. Either way the libel will be dismissed. See Ira M. Hedges, \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S. Ct. 1039, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235; Lamar v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 60, 64\n, 36 S. Ct. 255.\n Decree reversed.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n I am unable to accept the view that an admiralty court may entertain an action in rem when there is nothing which the marshal can take into custody. The technical term 'in rem' is used to designate a proceeding against something. This court and text-writers again and again have pointed out the essential nature of such thing. The jurisdiction is founded upon physical power over a res within the district upon the theory that it is 'a contracting or offending entity,' a 'debtor' or 'offending \n\n[274 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n thing,' something that can be arrested or taken into custody, or which can be fairly designated as tangible property. The Sabine, 101 U. S. (11 Otto) 384, 388; The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17, 37\n, 24 S. Ct. 8; Benedict on Admiralty (5th Ed.)  11, 297; Hughes on Admiralty (2d Ed.) 400, 401; admiralty rules 10, 22.\n Here the thing supposed to be within the district and proceeded against was an unliquidated, uncertain and disputed claim for freight, which manifestly could not be arrested or taken into custody. To base jurisdiction for an action in rem upon this intangible claim would amount to a denial of the essential nature of the proceeding.\n Of course, jurisdiction of an admiralty court-that is, power to hear and adjudge the issues, not merely to send out a monition-is not finally to be determined by mere allegations of the libel any more than jurisdiction of a court of law ultimately depends upon the plaintiff's allegation that the defendant is alive and within the district. If it appear that the defendant has never been there or was dead when the action began, certainly the court can go no further.\n An examination of Freights of the Kate (D. C.) 63 F. 707, American Steel Barge Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Coal Agency Co. (C. C. A.) 115 F. 669, Bank of British North America v. Freights of the Hutton (C. C. A.) 137 F. 534, 538, and Larsen v. 150 Bales of Sisal Grass (D. C.) 147 F. 783, 785, I think, will fail to disclose any adequate support for the theory repudiated by the court below. Some language of American Steel Barge Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Coal Agency Co., taken alone, seems to favor that view; but, in fact, the libel there was against 'the cargo of coal' 'and the freight on said cargo of coal.' The prayer asked for process against 'said cargo of coal and against said sub-freight thereon,' and 'that said cargo may be ordered by the court to be sold and the proceeds thereof applied to said payment.'\n The decree below should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO.(1927)\nNo. 254\nArgued: October 26, 1926Decided: June 6, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 693, 694]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. William J. Donovan, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. William S. Elliott, Frank H. Scott, and Victor A. Remy, all of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal, under  238 of the Judicial Code as amended by the Jurisdictional Act of 1925,1 from a final decree of the District Court-specially constituted under the Expediting Act2 and composed of three Circuit Judges-dismissing a supplemental petition of the United States to obtain further relief in addition to that granted by an earlier decree in the same case.\n In the original petition, which was filed in 1912, the United States alleged that the International HarvesterCompany3-hereinafter refereed to as the International Company-and other defendants were engaged in a combination restraining interstate trade and commerce in harvesting machines and other agricultural implements and monopolizing such trade in violation of the Anti-Trust Act;4 that the International Company had been \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 695]\n\u00a0\n formed by certain of the other defendants in 1902, with a capital stock of $ 120,000,000, for the purpose of combining five separate companies then manufacturing and selling harvesting machinery, whose aggregate output exceeded 85 per cent. of such machinery produced and sold in the United States, and thereby eliminating competition between these companies, restraining and monopolizing the interstate trade in such machinery, and promoting a similar monopoly in other agricultural implements; that in pursuance of such purpose the International Company acquired in 1902 the entire property and business of these five companies; that it thereafter acquired the property and business of various competitors and the control of steel, coal and other subsidiary companies, added all other classes of agricultural implements to its lines used various unfair trade methods and practices to destroy its competitors, closed the opportunities for new competitiors in all lines of agricultural implements, and advanced the price of harvesting machinery; and that it was then producing at least 90 per cent. of the grain bindings and 75 per cent. of the mowers produced and sold in the United States, and over 30 per cent. of all agricultural implements other than harvesting machinery.\n After an extended hearing on the merits, the District Court held-one judge dissenting-that although, it was not shown that there had been any unfair or unjust treatment by the International Company of its competitors and there was nothing in the history of its expanding lines which should be condemned, it had been, from its beginning in 1902, and then was, a combination violating the Anti-Trust Act, suppressing competition between the five original companies and directly tending to a monopoly, a condition that had been accentuated by its subsequent acquisition of competing plants and subsidiary companies; and that the entire combination and monop- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 696]\n\u00a0\n oly should be dissolved. 214 F. 987. By the decree as originally entered in August 1914, it was 'adjudged and decreed that said combination and monopoly be forever dissolved to the end that the business and assets of the International Harvester Company be separated and divided among at least three substantially equal, separate, distinct, and independent corporations with wholly separate owners and stockholders,' and that the defendants submit a plan of such separation for the consideration of the court; and jurisdiction was retained to make such additional decrees as might be necessary to secure the final dissolution of the combination and monopoly. This was subsequently modified by a decree entered in October, 1914, by which, pursuant to an agreement with the Attorney General of the United States, the provision requiring the business and assets of the International Company to be separated and divided among at least three distinct corporations was stricken out, and a provision was substituted requiring that its business and assets 'be divided in such manner and into such number of parts of separate and distinct ownership as may be necessary to restore competitive conditions and bring about a new situation in harmony with law.'\n The defendants appealed from the final decree to this Court; but, before the case had been decided, dismissed their appeal, pursuant to an agreement between the parties. And after the case had been remanded to the District Court, upon a stipulation signed by the Attorney General of the United States and the solicitors for the defendants, a consent decree was entered therein, on November 2, 1918, which, after reinstating the former decree as modified, recited that:\n'The parties having agreed upon and submitted to the court a plan for carrying into effect the order contained in said decree that the combination and monopoly therein adjudged unlawful be dis- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 697]\n\u00a0\n solved, and the court having considered and approved the plan, it is further ordered, in accordance therewith, as follows': (a) The International Company is prohibited and enjoined from having more than one representative or agent in any city or town for the sale of harvesting machines and other agricultural implements. (b) It shall offer for sale to responsible manufacturers of agricultural implements, the harvesting machine lines made and sold by it under the trade names of Osborne, Milwaukee, and Champion, respectively, with the equipment specially used in their manufacture, and accept a reasonable price from any purchaser approved by the United States. (c) It shall also endeavor to sell in connection with said harvester lines the Champion and Osborne harvester plants, and accept a reasonable price therefor from the purchasers of said harvester lines . (d) If any of said harvester lines, including plant, etc., shall not have been sold within one year after the close of the existing war, then, upon request of the United States, the same shall be sold at public auction. (e) 'The object to be attained under the terms of this decree is to restore competitive conditions in the United States in the interstate business in harvesting machines and other agricultural implements, and, in the event that such competitive conditions shall not have been established at the expiration of eighteen months after the termination of the existing war ... then and in that case the United States shall have the right to such further relief herein as shall be necessary to restore said competitive conditions and to bring about a situation in harmoney with law; and this court reserves all necessary jurisdiction and power to carry into effect the provisions of the decrees herein entered.'\n\n Thereafter, in 1920, after a hearing upon evidence, the court entered an order adjudging and decreeing, the United States consenting thereto, that the decree of 1918, \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 698]\n\u00a0\n properly interpreted, did not require the International Company to offer for sale the Champion and Osborne harvester plants except in connection with sales of the respective harvester lines; and further adjudging and decreeing that inasmuch as the International Company had, pursuant to the provisions of said decree, 'duly sold' the Champion and Osborne harvester lines to companies which did not desire to purchase the respective plants, the latter were not subject to sale under the provisions of said decree.\n In July, 1923, more than eighteen months after the termination of the war, the United States filed in the District Court the supplemental petition here involved, for the purpose, as stated, of securing, in accordance with clause (e) of the decree of November 2, 1918, such further relief as should be 'necessary to restore competitive conditions in interstate business in harvesting machines and other agricultural implements, and bring about a situation in harmony with law.' This petition alleged that the output and sales of the Champion, Osborne and Milwaukee harvesting lines which the International Company had been required to sell under that decree, constituted such a small part of its total output and sales and such a negligible part of the total trade in harvesting machines in the United States, that the decree was inadequate to accomplish its declared purpose; that the sale of the Osborne and Champion lines had had little or no effect upon competitive conditions; that, although the Milwaukee line had not been sold, the United States had not requested its sale at public auction under clause (d) of the decree, as its separation could have no appreciable effect on competition; that the International Company's control of interstate trade in harvesting machines had increased from 1918 to 1922; that the number of independent manufacturers of harvesting machines was steadily shrinking, due to their inability to compete with the In- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 699]\n\u00a0\n ternational Company, which, with its large capital, credit, resources, profitable side lines and subsidiaries, was enabled, particularly in times of depression, to sell its harvesting machines at cost, generally lower than that of its competitors, and thus effectually eliminate competition and monopolize the business; that it had used its power in this manner, particularly since the decree of 1918, for the purpose and with the effect of restraining and monopolizing trade in harvesting machines by compelling its competitors to cease their manufacture and sale; and that unless the combination and monopoly that had been found to exist should be effectively dissolved by dividing the International Company into at least three separate concerns, its monopolistic control would increase and become complete.\n The petition prayed that the court adjudge and decree that the International Company still was a combination and monopoly restraining interstate trade in harvesting machinery; that the decree of 1918 was inadequate to achieve its declared purpose and the United States was entitled to the further relief necessary to restore competitive conditions and bring about a situation in harmony with law; and that the business and assets of the International Company 'be separated and divided among at least three separate, distinct and independent corporations of wholly separate owners, stockholders and managers, substantially as suggested by the Federal Trade Commission in its report to the Senate dated May 4, 1920,' which was filed as an exhibit to the petition.\n The report thus referred to had been made pursuant to a Senate Resolution of May, 1918, directing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the causes for the high prices of agricultural implements, and any restraint of trade therein. The Commission had made an ex parte investigation, covering mainly the period from 1913 to 1918, and based largely upon data furnished by various \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 700]\n\u00a0\n manufacturers of agricultural implements concerning their costs, profits, etc., the results of which were tabulated by its accountants, partly in connection with a previous report that had been made by the former Bureau of Corporations. In this report-made only a year and a half after the entry of the consent decree of 1918 and before the war had terminated-the Commission had expressed the opinion that this decree would fail of its purpose to restore competitive conditions and that further steps were necessary to secure its object; and had recommended that the business and assets of the International Company be divided among three new companies as therein outlined. A copy of this report had also been transmitted to the Attorney General; and thereafter the Government, adopting the recommendation of the Commission, filed this supplemental petition.\n The petition was answered; an examiner appointed and evidence taken in 1924. In March of that year, as shown by the evidence, the International Company sold its Milwaukee line of harvesting machines, subject to the approval of the Attorney General or the court.\n At the hearing, in 1925, the District Court found that the International Company had complied with the requirements of clauses (a), ( b), (c) and (d) of the decree of 1918, and, without attempting to recite the evidence5 on the disputed questions of fact arising under the Government's application for further relief under clause (e), stated its conclusions-two judges concurring-as follows:\n'The evidence in this case has convinced, not only that it fails to prove by a fair, or any, preponderance thereof that the International Harvester Company, since the sale of the 'Osborne,' 'Milwaukee,' and 'Champion' lines and their appurtenances, has been or is unduly or \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 701]\n\u00a0\n unreasonably monopolizing or restraining interstate commerce in harvesting machines or their appurtenances in the United States; but in our opinion it conclusively proves that it has not done and in not doing so, that competition in the manufacture and sale of harvesting machines and their appurtenances in interstate commerce in the United States has been and is free and untrammeled, that the percentage of all such machines that were made and sold by the International Harvester Company has decreased from about 85 per cent. in 1902, to about 64 per cent. at the time of the decree of November 2, 1918, and ever since that powerful and successful independent competitors of the Harvester Company contest the field with it, and that in their presence it cannot and does not control or dictate the prices of the harvesting machines and their appurtenances which it and its competitors make and sell, that the prices of its machines and appurtenances to the dealers, and to the farmers who use them, in proportion to their costs, have decreased and are low. The purpose of perventing undue restraint of trade is to prevent unreasonably high prices to the purchasers and users of the articles traded in. The evidence in this case satisfies us that these objects have been successfully attained under the decree of November 2, 1918, the defendant's compliance with its requirements, and their conduct of their interstate commerce in harvesting machines and their appurtenances since the rendition of that decree.'\n\n From these conclusions the third judge dissented, upon the ground that the evidence convinced him that the decree of 1918 had entirely failed to restore genuine competitive conditions; that the International Company had such advantages in resources, organization, selling mediums, production costs, manufacture of raw material, and volume and spread of business, as to be able completely to dominate the trade in harvesting machines; and that it did so control and dominate by \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 702]\n\u00a0\n regulating prices, fixing the prices for its own machines, by which the other manufacturers were prudently governed. 10 F.(2d) 827. A decree was thereupon entered dismissing the supplemental petition.\n It is clear that the charges of the supplemental petition relate solely to the interstate trade in harvesting machines, and that no issue is involved as to the other lines of agricultural implements. As to this the parties agree; the Government specifically stating in its brief that this 'proceeding has to do only with an unlawful combination in harvesting machines.'\n The basic contention of the Government here in that the declared purpose of the decree of 1918 was to restore competitive conditions in the harvesting machine industry substantially as they had existed in 1902 before the International Company was formed by the combination of the five original companies, that is, to so increase the amount of competition and the number of competitors as to restore, in a 'quantitative' sense, 'the free and open competition which existed when the combination was formed,' and that therefore the sole test to be applied in determining whether the decree has accomplished its purpose, is whether it 'has had the effect actually to restore in the harvesting machine industry the competitive conditions which obtained prior to 1902.' We cannot sustain this contention. This is entirely inconsistent with the purpose of the consent decree, both as appears from its terms and as it was apparently construed by the District Court Itself. Its plain and evident purpose was to substitute for the requirement in the previous decrees that the International Company be divided into separate and distinct corporations, the requirements that, in order to establish 'competitive conditions' bringing about 'a situation in harmony with law,' the International Company should limit its sales agency in any town or city to a single representative, and should sell three of \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 703]\n\u00a0\n its harvesting machine lines to independent manufacturers of agricultural implements; and to give the United States the right to further relief only 'in the event' that within eighteen months after the termination of the war such competitive conditions had not been established. And a construction of this decree by which, although its requirements have been fully complied with and lawful competitive conditions established, the United States would nevertheless be entitled to further relief by the division of the International Company into separate and distinct corporations for the purpose of restoring the actual competitive conditions that had existed sixteen years before the entry of the consent decree, would plainly be repugnant to the agreement approved by the court and embodied in the decree, which has become binding upon all parties, and upon which the International Company has, in the exercise of good faith, been entitled to rely.\n In support of its alternative contention that competitive conditions have not been established bringing about a situation in harmony with law, the Government relies in large measure upon various statements and tabulations contained in the report of the Federal Trade Commission, which was introduced in evidence over the objection of the International Company. But it is entirely plain that to treat the statements in this report-based upon an ex parte investigation and formulated in the manner hereinabove set forth-as constituting in themselves substantive evidence upon the questions of fact here involved, violates the fundamental rules of evidence entitling the parties to a trial of issues of fact, not upon hearsay, but upon the testimony of persons having first-hand knowledge of the facts, who are produced as witnesses and are subject to the test of cross-examination. And no support for the Government's contention in this respect is afforded by Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 704]\n\u00a0\n \n262 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 37 S., 43 S. Ct. 470, in which the reference to statements that had been made by the Federal Trade Commission in a report to the President prior to the passage of the Act of Congress whose constitutional validity was involved, was solely as an aid in determining whether this Court was warranted in rejecting as unreasonable a finding that had been made by Congress as to the necessity for the Act.\n Without entering into a detailed statement of the evidence-which is so voluminous as to render this impracticable-we find, from the greater weight of the competitent testimony, that competitive conditions in the trade in harvesting machines have been established in compliance with the requirements of the consent decree.\n In the course of a general development that had taken place in the agricultural industry since 1902, the International Company and many of its principal competitors had extended their lines from implements used in particular seasons, such as harvesting machines, plows and seeders, and had become in 1918, when the consent decree was entered, 'long-line' year- round companies, manufacturing and selling full lines of agricultural implements. This had led to cheaper production and distribution; and, the sale of one line helping to sell the others, had brought about a change in competitive conditions affecting generally all their lines. In distributing their products they had also generally adopted the plan of selling their implements to local retail dealers, who resold them to farmers; and these dealers had become, through their personal efficiency and the good will and the friendly relations which they had established with the farmers, factors of prime importance in distributing the implements of the different companies. Prior to 1912 the International Company had also adopted the general policy, when there was more than one implement dealer in any town, of distributing its various lines, especially its Mc- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 705]\n\u00a0\n Cormick and Deering harvesting machines, among different dealers; and by means of 'exclusive' contracts made with such dealers, its competitors were frequently prevented from acquiring any adequate retail outlet for their implements. This was one of the practices which the Government had assailed in its original petition. Furthermore, as the International Company-having five different lines of harvesting machines, which were necessarily somewhat in competition among themselves-had laid chief stress upon its McCormick and Deering lines, the sales of its Champion, Osborne and Milwaukee lines, which were frequently combined in the hands of one dealer, had proportionately decreased; so that these three lines furnished in 1918 a comparatively small part of its harvesting machine business. This, however, was by no means negligible; and these three lines, which had been improved and kept up to date, still retained a well-established reputation and a capacity for effective development.\n In this situation the consent decree provided, as the means of establishing the competitive conditions which it sought to bring about, that the International Company should be limited to one sales representative in any town or city, and should sell its Champion, Osborne and Milwaukee harvesting lines to independent manufactures of agricultural implements.\n The International Company complied immediately with the single-dealer requirement in clause (a) of the consent decree. This has cause a drastic limitation upon its method of distribution, to which none of its competitors have been subject. By such compliance it lost the services of almost 5,000 dealers, to whom it had sold in the preceeding year implements to the amount of more than $17,000,000. Many of these were taken over by its competitors, who acquired the benefit of their experience, good will and standing among the farmers. It was also compelled to place its McCormick and Deering harvest- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 706]\n\u00a0\n ing lines, which usually had been handled by two dealers, with one of these dealers, who had developed a business in only one of them and was placed at a great disadvantage in handling them together; a difficulty which it has sought to overcome as far as possible by combining its McCormick and Deering lines into a new harvesting line that it has been attempting to introduce in the American market in place of the two separate lines. Further, being limited to one dealer in a town, and having its own tractor to sell in competition with the Fordson tractor, it has not been in a position to place its implements with Ford dealers, who have been available to its competitors as new and favorable outlets for their implements. And, in general, it clearly appears that the single-dealer limitation in the consent decree has greatly enlarged the field of activity of its competitors, and has proved to be, as had been anticipated, an effective means of providing competitive conditions. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The International Company also complied with the requirements of clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the consent decree by selling its Champion, Osborne and Milwaukee harvesting lines to independent manufacturers of agricultural implements. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[274 U.S. 693, 707]\n\u00a0\n The purchasers-B. T. Avery & Son, the Emerson-Brantingham Company, and the Moline Plow Company-are old-established and well-known companies, and among the largest manufacturers of implements in the United States. The acquisition of these established lines of harvesting machinery, filling out and strengthening their other implement lines, has greatly increased their competitive strength as long-line companies. And although there was from 1921 to 1923 a period of great depression in the agricultural implement industry, corresponding to the general depression in agricultural conditions, which made it difficult to launch new lines and develop new business, the officers of each of these companies testified as to their entire satisfaction with thier new lines, the resulting increase in their competitive ability, and their confidence that with the resumption of better conditions in the industry they would be able to compete energetically and successfully with the International Company in the harvesting machine business. And we cannot doubt, upon the entire evidence, that the provision of the consent decree by which these three established harvesting lines were taken away from the International Company, in whose hands they had not been developed, and transferred to the purchasing companies, whose long lines were filled out and strengthened, has constituted and will constitute in progressive degree, as the agricultural depression ceases, an effective means of increasing the competition in harvesting machinery as contemplated by that decree.\n It does not appear that since the entry of the consent decree the International Company has used its capital and resources-which, although much larger than those of any single competitor, are but little larger than the aggregate capital and resources of all its competitors, and are in large part employed in its foreign trade-its subsidiary companies or incidental advantages, for the pur- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 708]\n\u00a0\n pose or with the effect of restraining and suppressing the interstate trade in harvesting machinery; that it has at any time reduced the prices of harvesting machines below cost, for the purpose of driving out its competitors; or that it has at any time controlled and dominated the trade in harvesting machinery by the regulation of prices. It is true that in 1921 and 1922, the period of acute depression in the agricultural implement industry-due chiefly to the depressed agricultural conditions and the diminished purchasing power of the farmers-not only the International Company but its competitors, in a movement initiated by the leading manufacturer of plows, for the purpose primarily of disposing of the surplus stocks which they had accumulated during the war period under high cost conditions, and as a necessary measure of self-protection, made generally material reductions in the prices of harvesting machines and other implements. But the International Company did not at any time reduce its prices below replacement cost; and its reduction in prices was not intended to eliminate competition and has not had that effect. It has not, either during those two years or since, attempted to dominate or in fact controlled or dominated the harvesting machinery industry by the compulsory regulation of prices. The most that can be said as to this, is that many of its competitors have been accustomed, independently and as a matter of business expediency, to follow approximately the prices at which it has sold its harvesting machines; but one of its competitors has habitually sold its machines at somewhat higher prices. The law, however, does not make the mere size of a corporation, however impressive, or the existence of unexerted power on its part, an offense, when unaccompanied by unlawful conduct in the exercise of its power. United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417, 451\n, 40 S. Ct. 293, 8 A. L. R. 1121. And the fact that competitors may see proper, in the exercise of their own judg- \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 709]\n\u00a0\n ment, to follow the prices of another manufacturer, does not establish any suppression of competition or show any sinister domination. United States v. United States Steel Corporation, supra, 448 (40 S. Ct. 293). And see Cement Mfrs. Protective Ass'n v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588, 606\n, 45 S. Ct. 586, 592\n\n\n We further find that while several of the competitors of the International Company in harvesting machines have retired from business since 1911, some during the period of depression commencing in 1921, these retirements were not due to inability to compete with the Internationl Company, but to other causes for which it was in no way responsible; that the place of these retiring competitors has been taken by other and stronger competitors; and that in 1923 it not only had as many competitors in harvesting machines as in 1911, but competitors of greater strength and competitive efficiency.\n We also find that the International Company's percentage of the interstate trade in harvesting machinery is not shown to have increased since 1918, as the Government alleged; but, on the contrary, appears to have already decreased. The evidence does not show with any definiteness the percentage of the International Company's trade in such machinery in 1918. This, as alleged in the supplemental petition, had been approximately 77 per cent. in 1911, the year before the original petition was filed. And the Government's own tabulations show that while in 1919, the year after the consent decree was entered, the International Company sold 66.6 per cent. of all the harvesting machines sold in the United States, in 1923, its percentage was only 64.1 per cent. We need not determine the disputed question whether, as the International Company contends, there had been in fact a larger decrease.\n And, finally, the testimony, practically uncontradicted, of a great number of witnesses, including officers of competitive companies, competitive retail dealers who had \n\n[274 U.S. 693, 710]\n\u00a0\n handled the International Company's lines before the single-dealer requirement was put into effect, and the officers of farmers associations, leaves no room to doubt that since the entry of the decree of 1918, there had been established, and then existed, a free, untrammeled, keen and effective competition in harvesting machinery that was in no wise restrained or suppressed by the International Company.\n We conclude that not only has the International Company complied with the specific requirements of the consent decree, but that competitive conditions have been established in the interstate trade in harvesting machinery bringing about 'a situation in harmony with law.' The decree of the District Court dismissing the supplemental petition, is therefore\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or determination of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 43 St. 936, c. 229,  1 (Comp.

The second was entered into between the Chemical Company and the Shelby Iron Company of New Jersey in anticipation of the first. The Iron Company agreed to \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 573]\n\u00a0\n convey to the Chemical Company the needed land, which was near the works of the Iron Company, and to furnish hardwood, water, workmen's houses, and power necessary in the operation of the plant. The benefit which the Iron Company was to derive from the arrangement was the cheapness of cost in the charcoal to be made by the Chemical Company as a by-product of the process of distillation, and to be sold at a fixed price to the Iron Company for use in its blast furnaces situated in a large tract of timber land, of which the Iron Company was the owner, and of which the 15 acres here in question was a part.\n The Chemical Company executed a warranty deed of the 15 acres to the government in intended compliance with its contract, but the Iron Company had failed to convey the land to the Chemical Company as agreed by it. A deed was actually executed to the Chemical Company by an Alabama company of the same name, instead of the New Jersey company that owned the land. The Alabama company, a former owner of the land, was then an inactive company, the stock of which was owned by the New Jersey company, and the directors in the two companies were the same. So the government legal title failed for misdescription of the grantor.\n This suit was a bill in equity to quiet title to the United States against the two companies, the Alabama company and the New Jersey company. The New Jersey company, relying on the misdescription, answered and denied the title of the United States. Thereupon the government amended its bill and asked that the deed be reformed. Then the New Jersey company, which we shall hereafter call the Iron Company, answered by a recital of facts which, it claimed, showed that it has an equity in the 15 acres of land stronger in right than that of the United States. This constitutes the issue in this case, for the mistake and misdescription are admitted, and the \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n right of the United States for reformation of the deed is conceded, but for this claim.\n The contract between the Iron Company and the Chemical Company was made April 8, 1918, and provided that the Iron Company should by warranty deed, free of all liens and incumbrances, for a nominal consideration, provide sufficient ground on which to build the plant of the Chemical Company. By subsequent clause, it says:\n'Inasmuch as the United States government will be financially interested in the construction of the Chemical Company's plant, it is expressly agreed that such real estate may be deeded to and vested in the United States government during the period of a contract made between the Chemical Company and the United States government; said contract to extend for the duration of the war; and further'\n\n -it is understood that the Chemical Company is about to construct its plant under a contract with the United States government, by the terms of which the Chemical Company is to take the ownership of the land, buildings, equipment, and improvements, if an enabling statute to that effect shall be passed by the Congress of the United States. Therefore it is distinctly agreed that the foregoing provision as to reconveyance of the lands is subject to the obtaining of the title to said lands by the Chemical Company from the United States government.\n By the eighth paragraph, it was provided that the contract should last until April 1, 1933, with the right of the Iron Company to extend it further for five years upon notice to the Chemical Company; and that at the end of the contract, or its renewal, the Chemical Company should reconvey to the Iron Company all of the lands conveyed to it by the Iron Company without cost to it, free and clear of any incumbrances or liens whatsoever, or if there were any mortgages on the same not yet due, the Chemical Company should pay over to the Iron Company the amount thereof or the amount of any bonds outstand- \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 575]\n\u00a0\n ing thereunder, with any accrued interest thereon, and should, if the Iron Company so elected, sell to it all the improvements, equipment and other personal property placed on the lands of the Chemical Company.\n Thereafter, on April 28, 1918, the government contract with the Chemical Company was made. It was estimated that the plant would cost over $ 400,000, which the United States agreed to advance, and reimburse itself by deductions from payment to be made from the sale by the Chemical Company to the government of the acetate of lime and the methyl alcohol.\n Among the preliminary recitals in the contract is this:\n'Whereas, the contractor has a contract with the Shelby Iron Company, of Shelby county, Alabama, according to the terms of which the Shelby Chemical Company shall receive all the lumber it may require from timber land owned and leased by the Shelby Iron Company in return for all charcoal derived therefrom.'\n\n This recital becomes important on the question of notice hereafter to be considered.\n The government contract in its first article provided that the Chemical Company, the contractor, was to convey to the United States a tract of land at Shelby, Ala., of adequate size and suitable location, for the erection of the plant thereafter described. The conveyance was to be made subject to and upon the completion of an opinion by the Attorney General that by the conveyance the government would derive an absolute title to the premises in fee simple, free and clear of all incumbrances, and that the United States should have the right to expend money for the erection of improvements thereon.\n By article II the contractor agreed to erect and construct for the government on the land a properly equipped wood chemical plant with a certain capacity, to be completed in five months, to be paid for by the govern- \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 576]\n\u00a0\n ment at cost, the particulars of construction to be embodied in a separate contract.\n The third article provided for the retention of 40 per cent. of the price of all sales to the government for the products of the manufacture to yield 6 per cent. interest on the government investment in the plant and to constitute a depreciation and amortization fund for the benefit of the government.\n By the fourth article the contractor agreed to sell and deliver to the government the entire output of the acetate of lime and the methyl alcohol, and the government agreed to buy it, during a period of 18 months, and then for the duration of the war, at certain agreed prices and on certain conditions.\n By the sixth article it was provided that, when the depreciation and amortization fund and the purchase fund provided should together equal the cost to the government, with interest at 6 per cent., of the government's investment, or at any earlier date at the option of the contractor, the government should sell to the contractor, and the contractor should purchase, the plant, machinery, and equipment at the then fair market value to be fixed by appraisement. The obligation of the government to sell the plant was conditioned upon its having legal authority to make such sale and conveyance.\n Article VII provided that the government might take possession of the plant and operate it, on failure of the contractor to comply with the terms of the contract; but its right to operate should cease and terminate at the end of the war. If at that time the sale of the plant to the contractor should have been consummated, the government was to surrender possession to the contractor; and if the plant was then still owned by the government, it should at its own expense, within six months from the end of the war, remove all buildings and equipment constituting such plant from the ground upon which the same \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 577]\n\u00a0\n were erected, and should without further consideration reconvey such ground to the contractor.\n Article 17 provides that in the event of an armistice, the government at its option might terminate the agreement, but in such event the contractor should receive from the government the unpaid purchase price of the product then actually manufactured, and the contractor should receive further from the government a sum sufficient to protect him against his actual net expenditures and actual net outstanding obligations incurred in the manufacture. Then the value of the plant, machinery, and equipment should be determined by appraisal, as already provided, and the government should sell and the contractor should purchase the plant and equipment at the appraised value, and in making the settlement the contractor should be given credit on account of the purchase price for the 35 per cent. of the purchase price of the products theretofore sold to the government and by it retained for security.\n After the plant had been partially constructed, and $260,000 was still owing to the government from the Chemical Company, a new contract was made between them, dated January 25, 1919, whereby the government should become the absolute owner of the property free of all claims, and the government should lease the property to the contractor for three years, the contractor to pay to the government $50,000 down on account of the rental, and in one year $50,000 more, and in two years $75,000, and in three years $85,000, all of which was to apply as rental for the property. The company was to pay all the taxes. It was further provided that the contractor should complete the plant, then at the expiration of the three years the government, for the consideration of $1, would convey the whole property to the contractor, or should the contractor, not being then in default for \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 578]\n\u00a0\n any unpaid payments required to be paid by it under the terms of the contract, desire at any time to purchase the property, the government would sell it for a sum equal to the difference between $260,000 and the total sum of rents then paid. It was agreed in the contract that, should the contractor at any time default in any of the payments required to be made to the government in the lease, the government might waive such default, or treat and regard the lease and obligation and privilege to purchase as forfeited, or treat and regard the lease as a continuing legal and binding obligation, but the obligation and privilege to purchase was to be forfeited.\n The president of the Iron Company denies that it had knowledge of this second contract. The plant was completed under the second contract, and charcoal was made and delivered to the Iron Company till 1922, in March. The government took over the plant in December, 1922, and the Chemical Company became a bankrupt in 1923\n\n\n It is clear that the effect of the purported contract of lease of January, 1919, was that of an equitable mortgage. The rentals to be paid were the installments of the amount due under the original contract from the Chemical Company for the amount of money which the government had advanced, less that which it had already received, and upon payment of the rental stipulated, the title was to revert to the Chemical Company, while the government reserved the power to take over the property in case of default or bankruptcy of the Chemical Company. Its default gave to the government the right to enforce against the land and the plant the debt due under this equitable mortgage. Peugh v. Davis, \n96 U.S. 332\n, 336; Robinson v. Farrelly, 16 Ala. 472; Lowery v. Peterson, 75 Ala. 109, 111; Moses v. Johnson, 88 Ala. 517, 520, 7 So. 146, 16 Am. St. Rep. 58; Love v. Butler, 129 Ala. 531, 537, 538, 30 So. 735.\n The remedy which we think the government is entitled to, unless it is to be defeated for the reasons about to be \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 579]\n\u00a0\n examined, is not the reforming of a deed and a decree compelling the Shelby Iron Company of New Jersey to substitute its own deed to the Chemical Company for the useless and void deed of the Shelby Iron Company of Alabama. It is rather to give to the government leave to reframe its pleadings, so as to set up therein its ownership of an equitable mortgage upon the land and the plant, to be enforced by a sale thereof and the proper distribution of the proceeds. Of course, we might affirm the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, with a provision in the affirmance that it should be without prejudice to the beginning of an original suit by a new bill in equity setting forth the equitable mortgage as against the Iron Company, and asking its enforcement, and, if need be, its foreclosure against the land and the plant. We think, however, that it is wiser and better and shorter to end the litigation in this one proceeding.\n The Iron Company objects to this action by the court, on the ground that it has conflicting equitable rights that should defeat any recovery under the alleged mortgage. It insists that under the original contract, as construed in the light of its contract with the Chemical Company, the title of the government to the land and plant, even if it had been perfected as a legal title, was to terminate at the end of the war, and that the Iron Company was entitled, as against the Chemical Company and the government, to the reconveyance of the land. It further insists that the government knew of this limitation upon its right to retain the ownership of the property as shown in the contract between the Iron Company and the Chemical Company, and that its only security was in the power reserved to it by the original contract between it and the Chemical Company to remove from the land the plant within six months, and this it has not exercised and refuses to do so. It shows that it expended $50,000 in preparing for the \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 580]\n\u00a0\n changes due to the installation of the plant by the government, and has suffered loss by failure of the Chemical Company to comply with its contract. It further says that the 15 acres of land is so related to the larger tract of which it was a part that its use and control is essential to its operation of its blast furnace, and that it offered to pay the balance of $210,000 for the transfer of the government's whole interest in the land and plant to it. It urges that, as between it and the Chemical Company, it became entitled to a reconveyance, and to take possession of the land because of the breach and bankruptcy of the Chemical Company, as a termination of the contract as if it had expired by limitation. This presents an issue as to the notice which the government had of the Iron Company's claim under its contract.\n The argument of the Iron Company is that the recital in the government's contract that the Chemical Company would receive, under a contract with the Iron Company, all the lumber it might require from timber lands of the Iron Company in return for all charcoal derived therefrom, put the United States on notice of everything contained in the contract between the Chemical Company and the Iron Company in respect of the title to the land and the future plant. It relies on the principle that the law imputes knowledge, when opportunity and interest, coupled with reasonable care, would necessarily impart it, and that, where one paper refers to another paper within the power of the party, it gives notice of the contents of the other paper to that party. We have no quarrel with this rule as to constructive notice, but we do not think that it applies here. The reference in the first paper to require examination of the second must be one that indicates that both are dealing with a subject-matter to which inquiry would be relevant. Here the relevant object of the inquiry would have been the title \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 581]\n\u00a0\n to the land and the plant upon it. The recital does not refer either to the land or the title to it, but to the furnishing of wood by the Iron Company. To charge one with notice, the facts must be such as ordinarily to excite inquiry as to the particular fact to be elicited. Rogers v. Rawlings, 54 App. D. C. 361, 298 F. 683; Mueller v. Engeln, 75 Ky. (12 Bush.) 441; Hyde Park Supply Company v. Peck-Williamson Heating Company, 176 Ky. 513, 195 S. W. 1115; 2 Pomeroy's Eq.  629, pp. 1208, 1209.\n We think, therefore, that the question of notice must be re-examined, and that the issue must be not of implied notice, but of actual notice. It was contended that one of the officers acting for the government was in such a position that he probably knew what the contents and the effect of the contract between the Iron Company and the Chemical Company was in reference to the tenure of the government in the land, and that the fact that he was not called to testify on the subject was a circumstance tending to sustain the claim that the government had actual notice. The Iron Company will have the opportunity to present this and other evidence to the trial court upon the issue of such actual notice when the pleadings are reframed.\n Counsel for the government make a further argument to show that, even if the government had had notice of the contents of the contract between the Iron Company and the Chemical Company, its purpose and effect could not in any way impair the effect of the equitable mortgage the government acquired under its second contract and so-called lease to the Chemical Company. They say that the Iron Company in its contract with the Chemical Company, and in its eighth paragraph thereof, manifests clearly an expectation and consent that the Chemical Company might incumber the land and the plant with liens or mortgages, and relied only on the credit and \n\n[273 U.S. 571, 582]\n\u00a0\n obligation of the Chemical Company in reconveying to the Iron Company, to clear off mortgage liens or bonds which the Iron Company evidently thought the Chemical Company might create. If this is the correct view, an equitable mortgage of the government of the land and the plant, in which it had an interest to the extent of $260,000, must be clearly superior to the equity of the Iron Company growing out of the obligation of the Chemical Company to reconvey the land to the Iron Company. Neither the District Court nor the Circuit Court of Appeals considered this phase of the case. It may not have been presented to them. Their consideration was chiefly given to the issue of misdescription and to the meaning of the clauses providing for reconveyance of the land and improvements by the government in the contract between the government and the Chemical Company. We do not now consider and pass upon the contention of the government in these regards. We only refer to it to have it clearly understood that, when the cause goes back, nothing in what we have said shall prevent a showing of actual notice to the government of the claim of the equity of the Iron Company in the land by virtue of its contract with the Chemical Company on the one hand, or the construction of the eighth paragraph of that contract as a reason for maintaining the priority of the government's equitable mortgage, whether it had notice of the Iron Company's contract or not, on the other.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals will therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for a reframing of the pleadings, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES EX REL. SKINNER & EDDY CORP. v. MCCARL(1927)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: October 10, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Titus and J. Barrett Carter, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus, brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in October, 1924. The relator, Skinner & Eddy Corporation, seeks to compel the Comptroller General to pass upon its claims against the government. These arise under contracts made during the years 1917, 1918, and 1919 with the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. Most of the contracts refer to the corporation as 'representing the United States.' The claims were presented to the Comptroller General for allowance, because Skinner & Eddy wished to be in a position to use them as a credit, if the United States should, as was threatened, sue on the contracts. It deemed this course necessary, because section 951 of the Revised Statutes (United States Code, tit. 28,  774 ( 28 U. S. C. A.  774; Comp. St.  1588)) provides:\n'In suits brought by the United States against individuals, no claim for a credit shall be admitted, upon trial, except such as appear to have been presented to the accounting officers of the treasury, for their examination, and to have been by them \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n 'disallowed. ...'\n\n Compare United States v. Fisher Flouring Mills Co. (D. C.) 295 F. 691; Id. (C. C. A.) 17 F. (2d) 232.\n The Comptroller General declines to consider the claims, asserting that he has neither the duty nor the power to do so, and that the duty of passing upon them rests with the Shipping Board.\n In 1923, the Fleet Corporation assigned to the United States all of its assets, including accounts against divers persons for the payment of money. Thus the United States is the owner, either as principal or as assign of the Fleet Corporation, of all the claims against Skinner & Eddy. Two actions arising out of these contracts are now pending in the federal court for the Western District of Washington. One is a suit by Skinner & Eddy against the Fleet Corporation, begun in 1923 in a state court of Washington, and removed to the federal court. In that case, the defendant has moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that the claim sued on is one against the United States. \n1\n The other action is a suit by the United States against Skinner & Eddy, commenced in the federal court since this petition for a writ of mandamus was filed.\n The question whether the writ of mandamus should issue is presented by a demurrer to the plea and traverse which was interposed to the answer. The Supreme Court of the District sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition without opinion. Its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District, 56 App. D. C. 52, 8 F.(2d) 1011. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n270 \nU.S. 636\n, 46 S. Ct. 205. The government insists that the petition was properly dismissed, because claims arising out of contracts with the Fleet Corporation are not within the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General, and that, even if they were, the \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n relief was properly denied, because his refusal to consider the claims was a disallowance thereof within the meaning of section 951, and thereby the requirement of that section was satisfied. It is conceded that mandamus is an appropriate remedy. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Humbolt S. S. Co., \n224 \nU.S. 474\n, 32 S. Ct. 556.\n The first contention involves a determination of the powers and duties of the Comptroller General and of the United States Shipping Board in respect to claims arising out of transactions of the Fleet Corporation. The powers and duties formerly 'imposed by law upon the Comptroller of the Treasury or the six Auditors of the Treasury Department' were transferred to the Comptroller General by Act of June 10, 1921, c. 18, title 3,  301- 304, 42 Stat. 30, 23, 34 (United States Code, tit. 31,  44 (31 USCA  41- 44; Comp. St.  400 4\/5-400 4\/5 b)). Section 305, amending section 236 of the Revised Statutes (31 USCA  71 (Comp. St.  368)), provides:\n'All claims and demands whatever by the government of the United States or against it, and all accounts whatever in which the government of the United States is concerned, either as debtor or creditor, shall be settled and adjusted in the General Accounting Office.'2\n\n The language of this grant, if standing alone, might possibly be broad enough to include authority to audit accounts and to pass upon claims \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n arising out of contracts made by a government-owned corporation 'representing the United States.' But here it must be construed in the light of the statutes dealing specifically with the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation, of the latter's origin and character, and of the administrative practice prevailing with regard to it and other similar corporations.\n The Fleet Corporation was organized on April 16, 1917-ten days after the United States declared war. All of its stock was subscribed and paid for by the Shipping Board on behalf of the United States. And all the stock has been held by it since. The company was formed by the Shipping Board, pursuant to the specific authority to form one or more corporations, which was conferred by the original Shipping Board Act. Act Sept. 7, 1916, c. 451,  11, 39 Stat. 728, 731 (46 USCA  810 (Comp. St.  8146f)). Congress conferred this authority in contemplation of the possibility of war, and it required that any such corporation should be dissolved 'at the expiration of five years from the conclusion of the present European War.' The Fleet Corporation is thus an instrumentality of the government. See United States v. Walter, \n263 \nU.S. 15, 18\n, 44 S. Ct. 10. But it was organized under the general laws of the District of Columbia, as a private corporation, with power to purchase, construct and operate merchant vessels. The act authorized the Board to sell, with the approval of the President, 'any or all of the stock of the United States in such corporation, but at no time \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n shall it be a minority stockholder therein.' Section 11.\n Being a private corporation, the Fleet Corporation may be sued in the state or federal courts like other private corporations; it does not enjoy the priority of the United States in bankruptcy proceedings (Sloan Shipyards Corporation v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, \n258 \nU.S. 549\n, 42 S. Ct. 386), and its employees are not agents of the United States, subject to the provisions of section 41 of the Criminal Code, being 18 USCA  93 (United States v. Strang, \n254 \nU.S. 491\n, 41 S. Ct. 165). Compare 34 Op. Attys. Gen. 241.\n Government-owned private corporations were employed by the United States as its instrumentalities in several other fields during the World War. The Food Administration Grain Corporation (later called the United States Grain Corporation) was organized under the laws of Delaware under Food Control Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53,  19, 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/8 n). See Act March 4, 1919, c. 125, 40 Stat. 1348, and Executive Orders of August 14, 1917, and March 4, 1919. The United States Spruce Corporation was organized by the Director of Air Craft Production under the laws of the District of Columbia, pursuant to Act July 9, 1918, c. 143, 40 Stat. 845, 888, 889 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/32 g-3115 1\/32 k), for the purpose of aiding in the production of aircraft material. The United States Housing Corporation was organized under the laws of the District of Columbia by authority of the President, for the purpose of providing housing for war needs under Act June 4, 1918, c. 92, 40 Stat. 594, 595 ( 3115 5\/6 g, 3115 5\/6 gg, 3115 5\/6 i). The War Finance Corporation was organized under Act April 5, 1918, c. 45, 40 Stat. 506 (15 USCA  331 et seq. (Comp. St.  3115 4\/5 a-3115 4\/5 qq)), to assist financially industries important to the successful prosecution of the War. For many years before the War, the government had employed the Panama Railroad Company as its instrumentality in connection with the Canal. \n3\n And, since \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n the War, the Inland Waterways Corporation has been organized by the Secretary of War to operate the government-owned inland waterways system pursuant to Act June 3, 1924, c. 243, 43 Stat. 360 (49 USCA  151-156 ( Comp. St.  10071 1\/2-10071 1\/2 e)). The government likewise has established, and holds all the stock in, the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, formed under Act March 4, 1923, c. 252, tit. 1,  205, 42 Stat. 1454, 1457 (12 USCA  1061), to bring about easier agricultural credits. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n At no time, during the War or since its close, have the financial transactions of the Fleet Corporation passed through the hands of the general accounting officers of the government or been passed upon, as accounts of the United States, either by the Comptroller of the Treasury or the Comptroller General. 5 The accounts of the Fleet Corporation, like those of each of the other corporations named, and like those of the Director General of Railroads during federal control,6 have been audited, and the control over their financial transactions has been exercised, in accordance with commercial practice, by the board or the officer charged with the responsibilities of \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n administration. \n7\n Indeed, an important, if not the chief, reason for employing these incorporated agencies was to enable them to employ commercial methods and to conduct their operations with a freedom supposed to be inconsistent with accountability to the treasury under its established procedure of audit and control over the financial transactions of the United States. \n8\n It is true that a kind of audit of the Fleet Corporation's transactions was later made by the general accounting officers pursuant to special legislation, said to have been enacted at the request of the Shipping Board. But there is no contention that these statutes, or the audit made thereunder, affect in any way the question here presented,9 save that they may show congressional approval of the practice theretofore prevailing. It may be that the other corporations above-mentioned expended no moneys \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n appropriated by Congress save those received from the sale of stock to the government, whereas the Fleet Corporation had the benefit of money appropriated to the Shipping Board and by it turned over to the corporation. \n10\n The first statute making such an appropriation, however, provided in terms that the moneys were to be expended 'as other moneys of said corporation are now expended.' Act June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, 183 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/16 d).\n The transactions of the Fleet Corporation arose out of the exercise of powers conferred upon it in several different ways. It was urged in the argument that the question of the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General would depend upon the source of the power giving rise to the transactions under consideration, because of certain special statutory provisions as to compensation for claimants, now to be considered. Besides powers conferred by the general incorporation laws of the District of Columbia, the Fleet Corporation was vested, by delegation from the President,11 with the powers conferred upon him by Act June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, Act April 22, 1918, c. 62, 40 Stat. 535, and Act Nov. 4, 1918, c. \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n 201, 40 Stat. 1020, 1022 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/16 d). Among them were the power to construct vessels and the power to modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition existing or future contracts for the construction of vessels. Act June 15, 1917, provided also that, when the United States should cancel or requisition any contract, it should make just compensation to be determined by the President, and that, if the persons concerned were dissatisfied with that determination, 75 per cent. of the amount so determined was to be paid and that suit for the additional amount claimed might be brought against the United States, in the manner provided in section 24 (20) and section 145 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41, 250 ( Comp. St.  991, 1136)). The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (Act June 5, 1920,  2, 41 Stat. 988 (46 USCA  862 (Comp. St.  8146 1\/4 a))) repealed the provisions of the acts of 1917 and 1918 above referred to; but it preserved all rights and remedies accruing as a result of any action taken under the provisions repealed, provided by section 2(b) for their enforcement as though the act had not been passed, except that, as provided in section 2(c), the Shipping Board should as soon as practicable 'adjust, settle, and liquidate all matters arising out of or incident to the exercise by or through the President of any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed upon the President by any such acts or parts of acts, and for this purpose the board, instead of the President, shall have and exercise any of such powers and duties relating to the determination and payment of just compensation: Provided, that any person dissatisfied with any decision of the board shall have the same right to sue the United States as he would have had if the decision had been made by the President of the United States under the acts hereby repealed.'\n The claims of Skinner & Eddy were mainly for the cancellation by the Fleet Corporation of contracts for the construction of vessels. The government contends that the contract giving birth to the claims arose out of or was incident to the exercise by or through the President \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n of the powers conferred upon him by the statutes referred to in section 2( c) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, and hence that the Shipping Board, and not the Comptroller General, has the power and duty to settle and adjust them and thus to allow or disallow any claims by way of credits or set-offs arising out of the contracts. Skinner & Eddy urge that their contracts were made by virtue of the power conferred upon the Fleet Corporation by the Shipping Act of 1916; that a controversy arising out of such contracts is not within section 2(c) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920; and that, hence, the Comptroller General had jurisdiction over its claims. We have no occasion to determine whether the contracts here in question were made under the original charter power of the Fleet Corporation or under the additional powers acquired by delegation from the President. Even if section 2(c) has no application, because the contracts were not entered into pursuant to the power delegated by the President in 1917, it does not follow that the claims fall within the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General. For the Fleet Corporation is an entity distinct from the United States and from any of its departments or boards, and the audit and control of its financial transactions is, under the general rules of law and the administrative practice, committed to its own corporate officers, except so far as control may be exerted by the Shipping Board. If, on the other hand, the contracts were made and canceled by the Fleet Corporation under the power delegated by the President, and settlement and adjustment of the claim falls clearly within the powers conferred by section 2(c) upon the Shipping Board.\n There is nothing in the language of the statutes, or in reason, to support the suggestion that the Shipping Board has the power to adjust claims, but that the adjustment does not become operative unless there is approval of the final settlement by the Comptroller General. Nor is \n\n[275 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n there any basis for the further suggestion of Skinner & Eddy that the Shipping Board has power to make settlement, if it can; but where a settlement is not made and a suit by the United States is brought or threatened, the Comptroller General is the official to whom must be presented all claims for credit in such suit. It is true that the Merchant Marine Act did not modify section 951 of the Revised Statutes or impair the right of a defendant to a credit, if sued by the United States upon a Fleet Corporation contract. Since the passage of the Merchant Marine Act, as before, the defendant may set up the credit, if he can show disallowance by the appropriate accounting officers. But section 951 does not prescribe who the appropriate officer is or that the claim must be presented to a general accounting officer of the government. As was held in United States v. Kimball, \n101 U.S. 726\n, the requirement of the section is satisfied when the claim is presented and disallowed by the officer who has power to allow the claim, although he is not a general accounting officer of the government.\n The Court of Appeals of the District based its judgment of affirmance solely upon the ground that, since the claims involved were already in the course of litigation in two suits in another federal court, no other court of co-ordinate jurisdiction could interfere. The Comptroller General had originally taken a somewhat similar ground for declining to act. But later he stated, in the trial court, that his answer should be taken as broadly denying his jurisdiction to consider claims of this nature. And in this court he specifically disclaimed reliance upon the ground taken by the Court of Appeals. We have no occasion to consider its validity. Nor need we consider whether the refusal of the Comptroller General to take jurisdiction was a disallowance of the claim within the meaning of section 951 or any of the other questions which have been argued concerning the application of that section.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1923, Skinner & Eddy began still another suit, upon the same cause of action, against the United States in the Court of Claims. It was finally allowed to dismiss that suit without prejudice. See In re Skinner & Eddy Corporation, \n265 \nU.S. 86\n, 44 S. Ct. 446. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The accounting branch of the Treasury Department was created by Act Sept. 2, 1789, c. 12,  1, 3, 5, 1 Stat. 65, 66. Steps in its growth and in the development of its control over Government expenditures may be traced in Act May 8, 1792, c. 37,  1, 1 Stat. 279; Act July 16, 1798, c. 85,  1, 1 Stat. 610; Act March 3, 1817, c. 45,  1, 3-5, 3 Stat. 366, 367; Act May 7, 1822, c. 90, 3 Stat. 688; Act March 30, 1868, c. 36, 15 Stat. 54; Act June 8, 1872, c. 335,  21-25, 17 Stat. 283, 287, 288. In 1894 there was a general revision of the statutes dealing with the accounting officers. Act July 31, 1894, c. 174, 28 Stat. 162, 205-211. The powers and duties there outlined were in the main those transferred to the General Accounting Office by the Act of 1921.\n The question of the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General is not a question as to bookkeeping merely. The decision of the Comptroller General upon the allowance of accounts within his jurisdiction is conclusive upon the executive branch of the government. Act July 31, 1894, c. 174,  8, 28 Stat. 162, 207 (Comp. St.  425), following the provisions of the earlier Act March 30, 1868, c. 36, 15 Stat. 54. Save in cases where resort is had to the courts, therefore, the Comptroller is the final arbiter as to the legality of expenditures.

These special audits were of a nature to afford some information concerning past transactions. But the acts did not vest control over expenditures either in the Secretary of the Treasury or in the General Accounting Officer making the audit; and none was asserted.

VAJTAUER v. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION(1927)\nNo. 111\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter H. Pollak and Isaac Shorr and Mrs. Carol Weiss King, all of New York City. for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Vajtauer, appellant, was arrested in deportation proceedings on a warrant issued April 4, 1924, by the Assistant Secretary of Labor charging that Vajtauer, an alien, had entered the United States December 1, 1923, in violation of the Act of October 16, 1918, c. 186 (40 Stat. 1012), as amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 251 (41 Stat. 1008), printed so far as relevant in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[273 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n The particular violations of the statute alleged were that prior to or at the time of his entry, appellant (1) believed in and advocated the overthrow of the government of the United States or all forms of law; (2) wrote, published, circulated or had in his possession for circulation written or printed matter advocating opposition to all organized government; (3) wrote, published, circulated or had in his possession for circulation written or printed matter advocating the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States or of all forms of law.\n After a hearing before an immigration inspector, and a review of all the proceedings by the Board of Review, the Secretary of Labor, upon the recommendation of that board, ordered deportation. While in the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration at the port of New York, the alien assailed the legality of his detention in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which was issued by the District Court for Southern New York. Upon the return of the writ and after a hearing, that court dismissed the writ, remanded appellant to the custody of the Commissioner and stayed deportation pending an appeal. 15 F.(2d) 127. The case comes here on direct appeal, on the ground that appellant was denied rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the federal Constitution. Section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), prior to the amendment of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936). \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n The constitutional questions assigned are (1) that the deportation order was unsupported by any substantial evidence and consequently appellant was denied a fair hearing and deprived of his liberty without due process; (2) that the action of the immigration authorities in drawing certain inferences from his refusal to answer questions asked, deprived him of the protection against self-incrimination accorded by the Fifth Amendment.\n Deportation without a fair hearing or on charges unsupported by any evidence is a denial of due process which may be corrected on habeas corpus. Cf. Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8\n, 28 S. Ct. 201; Kwock Jan Fat v. white, \n253 \nU.S. 454\n, 40 S. Ct. 566. But a want of due process is not established by showing merely that the decision is erroneous, Chin Yow v. United States, supra, \n208 U.S. 13\n ( 28 S. Ct. 201), or that incompetent evidence was received and considered. See Tisi v. Tod, \n264 \nU.S. 131, 133\n, 44 S. Ct. 260. Upon a collateral review in habeas corpus proceedings, it is sufficient that there was some evidence from which the conclusion of the administrative tribunal could be deduced and that it committed no error so flagrant as to convince a court of the essential unfairness of the trial. Tisi v. Tod, supra.\n The ultimate question presented by this record, therefore, is one of fact, whether the warrant of deportation was supported by any evidence that the alien when he entered the United States advocated opposition to all organized government or the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence, within the meaning of the statute. This requires a review of the evidence.\n At the hearing before the immigration authorities on May 14, 1924, appellant, who was represented by counsel, was sworn as a witness, gave his name as Emanuel Vajtauer and his occupation as 'Doctor of Psychology,' and editor of the 'Spravedlvost,' a Bohemian newspaper published in Chicago. He testified that he resided in Illinois; that he entered the United States on Decem- \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n ber 1, 1923; and that he was a citizen of Czechoslovakia by birth. After answering other preliminary questions, he was then asked: 'Why did you come to the United States?' Appellant's attorney then stated:\n'I will advise the alien not to answer any further questions until the evidence upon which the warrant is based will be presented here.' 2\n\n Appellant then stated that he would follow his attorney's advice, and gave no further testimony. The immigration inspector introduced in evidence a pamphlet, stated by him to bear the name of Dr. E. M. Vajtauer as author. An interpreter testified that it was Dr. Vajtauer's study of the Ressian Revolution. The title, as printed in the record, was:\n'Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, by Dr. E. Dajtauer, written in Moscow in the Spring of 1920.'\n\n Translations of certain passages from the pamphlet by the interpreter were spread upon the record. Some of these excerpts merely gave an account of the Russian revolution and the revolutionists' own justification for their overthrow of the Russian government. Others, printed in the margin, purported on their face to advocate the overthrow of government by revolution or force. 3 \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n The inspector also placed in evidence a newspaper published by the Slovak Labor Socialist Federation of America, containing a report of a speech stated in the record to have been made by a Dr. Vajtauer, the editor of the Bohemian daily, 'Spravedlvost.' In this address the causes and effects of the World War and of the revolutionary movements in Europe were described from the \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n viewpoint of the proletariat. The speaker predicted a much fiercer revolutionary struggle in this country than that which took place in Europe and the concluding paragraphs, printed in the margin,4 suggest at least that the speaker advocated such a revolution. Other documentary evidence received consisted of an abridged report of the 'Fourth Congress of the Communist International, Meetings held at Petrograd and Moscow, November 7 and December 3, 1922,' containing a statement purported to have been made by a Dr. Vajtauer, Czechoslovakia, on Cezchoslovakian affairs. \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n Under instructions of his attorney, appellant refused to answer further questions calculated to establish his identity with the author of the pamphlet and with the Dr. Vajtauer who made the address reported in the newspaper article and the Dr. Vajtauer who addressed the Congress of the Communist International.\n A point much argued before us was whether section 23 of the Immigration Law of May 26, 1924, c. 190 (43 Stat. 165 (Comp. St.  4289 3\/4kk)), which took effect before the hearing was closed, placed on appellant the burden of proving that he was not a member of a class of aliens excluded from entering the United States by the immigration laws. Section 23 provides in part:\n'And in any deportation proceeding against any alien the burden of proof shall be upon such alien to show that he entered the United States lawfully.'\n\n It was plausibly urged that the language of the statute was well as its legislative history indicates that this clause relates only to the proof of the regularity of the alien's entry with respect to time, place, manner and the like, and not to his membership in an excluded class. But we find it unnecessary to consider this question, as we think that the record taken as a whole and without the aid of any statutory presumption presents some evidence supporting the deportation order.\n We disregard the Moscow address as having no substantial bearing on appellant's membership in an excluded class. But the extracts from the pamphlet and the report of the Chicago speech, taken together, are at least some evidence tending to show that the author of them advised and advocated opposition to all organized government and the overthrow of the United States government by violence, and therefore could, as an alien, be excluded from admission into the United States by the provisions of section 1 of the Act of June 5, 1920, supra, or if admitted, deported if found to have been a member of an excluded class at the time of entry ( section 2). Statements made before or after \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n entry may be taken to indicate that he was subject to exclusion at the time of entry.\n The only other issue on which the government was required to present evidence, assuming that the burden of proof rested on it, was the identity of the appellant, admittedly an alien, with the author of the pamphlet and the address. The similarity of names; the fact that each was known as 'Doctor'; that a Dr. Vajtauer, also of Czechoslovakia, as was appellant, addressed the Fourth Congress of the Communist International on Czechoslovakian affairs in Moscow, where the pamphlet was written, and that after the arrival of appellant in the United States and his proceeding to Chicago, a Dr. Vajtauer, who was editor of the Bohemian daily paper, 'Spravedlvost,' as was appellant, made a public address in Chicago, discussing the Russian revolution and suggesting the possibilities of a similar revolution here, all taken together admit of the inference that the appellant and the author of the pamphlet and speech were one and the same person. This inference was strengthened when the appellant, confronted by this record, stood mute.\n'Conduct which forms a basis for inference is evidence. Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.' Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 \nU.S. 149, 153\n, 154 S., 44 S. Ct. 54, 56 (68 L. Ed. 221). Appellant as a witness was called upon to testify whether he was the author of the pamphlet and the Chicago speech, facts within his knowledge. If the author, he was in a position to challenge or explain away if possible any unfavorable inference which might be drawn from the passages read into the record. His silence without explanation other than that he would not testify until the entire evidence was presented, was in itself evidence that he was the author. In addition, it fortified the inferences drawn from the pamphlet and speech by the immigration authorities.\n\n Attention is directed to the fact that the refusal to testify was based upon a supposed right of the witness \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n not to be called upon to testify until all the evidence in support of the warrant was presented, and it is said that, if silence is induced by a person's 'doubts of his rights, by a belief that his security will be best promoted by his silence, then no inference of assent can be drawn from that silence.' Commonwealth v. Kenney, 12 Metc. (Mass.) 235, 237 (46 Am. Dec. 672); People v. Pfanschmidt, 262 Ill. 411, 449, 104 N. E. 804, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 1171. But these cases merely apply the rule that no inference may be drawn from silence where there is no duty to speak, a rule which is not applicable where the witness is sworn and under a legal duty to give testimony which is not privileged. Undoubtedly, inferences from silence should be cautiously drawn (Bilokumsky v. Tod, supra), but the weight to be given to silence is for the tribunal conducting the trial.\n It is said also that the evidentiary effect of silence was limited by the decision in Bilokumsky v. Tod, supra, to a refusal to testify as to non-incriminating facts only. Although the inference from silence in that case pertained to nonincriminating facts, there was no intimation there that inferences could not be drawn from a failure to testify to incriminating matter which are not privileged. Here, as in that case, the objection to drawing the inference can have force only in so far as there was a denial of the constitutional immunity.\n It is insisted that answers to the questions put to appellant at the hearings which were held in Chicago might have tended to incriminate him under the Illinois Syndicalism Law (Cahill's Ill. R. S. 1925, c. 38, pars. 587-593), which condemns as a felony the advocacy or publication of matter advising crime or violence or other unlawful means of accomplishing the reformation or overthrow of the government. Assuming that the constitutional immunity against self-incrimination may be violated as well by inferences drawn from silence with respect to incriminating matters as by testimony which the witness is compelled to give, still it is necessary to inquire whether the \n\n[273 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n appellant here has brought himself within the protection of the immunity.\n Throughout the proceedings before the immigration authorities, he did not assert his privilege or in any manner suggest that he withheld his testimony because there was any ground for fear of self-incrimination. His assertion of it here is evidently an afterthought. It is for the tribunal conducting the trial to determine what weight should be given to the contention of the witness that the answer sought will incriminate him, Mason v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 362\n, 37 S. Ct. 621; a determination which it cannot make if not advised of the contention. Cf. In re Edward Hess & Co. (D. C.) 136 F. 988; Ex parte Irvine (C. C.) 74 F. 954, 960. The privilege may not be relied on and must be deemed waived, if not in some manner fairly brought to the attention of the tribunal which must pass upon it. See In re Knickerbocker Steamboat Co. (D. C.) 139 F. 713; United States v. Skinner (D. C.) 218 F. 870, 876; United States v. Elton (D. C.) 222 F. 428, 435. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the extent to which the Fifth Amendment guarantees immunity from self-incrimination under state statutes, or whether this case is to be controlled by Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, 26 S. Ct. 370; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 608\n, 16 S. Ct. 644. Compare United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100; Ballmann v. Fagin, \n200 \nU.S. 186, 195\n, 26 S. Ct. 212.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following classes are excluded from adminision:\n'(a) Aliens who are anarchists;\n\n'(b) Aliens who advise, advocate, or teach, or who are members of or affiliated with any organization, association, society, or group, that advises, advocates, or teaches, opposition to all organized government;\n\n'(c) Aliens who believe in, advise, advocate, or teach, or who are members of or affiliated with any organization, association, society, or group, that believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches: (1) The overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States or of all forms of law; ...\n\n'(d) Aliens who write, publish, or cause to be written or published, or who knowingly circulate, distribute, print, or display, or knowingly cause to be circulated, distributed, printed, published, or displayed, or who knowingly have in their possession for the purpose of circulation, distribution, publication, or display, any written or printed matter, advising, advocating, or teaching, opposition to all organized government, or advising, advocating or teaching: (1) The overthrow by force or violence of the goverment of the United States or of all forms of law. ...

These rules has been changed before the first hearing of May 14, 1924. Even if counsel was unaware of the changes at that time, the hearing was not resumed until August 27, 1924, when the government's case was closed. Counsel declined an invitation to have the alien testify in his own behalf or to permit his examination although all the evidence on which the warrant was based had been presented. No reason for his not testifying was given. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Only when you kill the bourgeois-capitalist, only then you will be free.

They have a right to do that! Others have killed millions of their brothers previously. The lowest, the most suffering class of people has seized the rule into its own hands. It took away every chance of the murderers for further oppression and crime. It dictates quietly to the farmer vampires. It carries on the dictatorship of the proletariat!\n\n'This is the first problem of the proletarian dictatorship, and this is to capture the murderers and traitors of the people, the imperialists, militarists, capitalists, bourgeoisie and social-democrats and prevent them \n\n from committing any further crimes.\n'Should the Bohemian worker have as much courage as the Russian worker has, he would see quickly the necessity of seizing the rule of factory into his own hands and expel the owner of the factory who has no right to own the property of the factory. The plant, which is to supply the needs of the people, belongs to the people, and must be run only by the people, only by the working people. The means of production are not a private property, they are the people's property. Private property is only a masked loot of people's property. The government, which recognizes private property, is the government which recognizes the looting the people, and how the robbers are treated. They are treated so that they are not given chance to loot. The robber should be locked up, irons should be put on his wrists, and guard placed to watch him.\n\n'Revolution is a sudden expansion of the people which suddenly abolishes the injustice piled for centuries. The proletarian dictatorship is an armed guard of liberties gained by revolution.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Pointing out the proletariat of America, the speaker said, that when the time comes when the American proletariat, which have tasted a bit of the capitalistic luxuries, will find itself deprived of these luxuries, then the American proletariat will be much more revolutionary than that of Europe, it is hard to preach revolution to the full stomach, but once this stomach is empty it revolts, and seeks the means to obtain the supplies. The speaker pictured the American proletariat as a mole, which got hold of a bone thrown from the capitalistic table, to satisfy the hunger of this mole. He predicted much fiercer revolutionary struggle in this country than that which took place in Europe, much more blood will be shed in this country than was shed in Europe.\n'Toward the end of his speech, the speaker predicted that the next large war will be between the European countries and America, because America being a creditor, would in due time demand the payment of debt from debtors, and these being poor, would try to repudiate the American debt, this naturally would lead to war, and it would be up to the proletariat to stop the war of this kind, because the proletariat once more would be asked to supply the army. The speaker pointed out the Communistic government of Russia as an example for the proletariat of the other countries of the world, further he said, that there is a probability of another great war and this war may be the war between the United States Proletariat countries of Europe, against the capitalistic America, and then the proletariat of America would find itself in the position either to fight the proletariat of Europe, or else fight against its own capitalists, and it is up to the conscientions leaders of the proletariat to prepare the workers for this fatal moment.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n Alford was indicted for building a fire near inflammable grass and other inflammable material and timber situated upon the public domain of the United States, and for not extinguishing the same before leaving it, by reason of which the said grass and other material was burned. The count was demurred to on the ground that the statute concerned does not cover the building or leaving of fires at any place except upon a forest reservation, and that if it attempts to cover fires elsewhere it is unconstitutional and void. The District Court construed the statute in the same way and sustained the demurrer. A writ of error was taken by the United States.\n By the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431,  6 (36 Stat. 855, 857), amending section 53 of the Penal Code of March 4, 1909 (Comp. St.  10220):\n'Whoever shall build a fire in or near any forest, timber, or other inflammable material upon the public domain, or upon any Indian reservation, or lands belonging to or \n\n[274 U.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n occupied by any tribe of Indians under the authority of the United States, or upon any Indian allotment while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the Government, or while the same shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the United States, shall, before leaving said fire, totally extinguish the same; and whoever shall fail to do so shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.'\n\n The court read the words 'upon the public domain' as qualifying the phrase 'whoever shall build a fire.' We are of opinion that this was error, and that 'upon the public domain' should be referred to the words immediately preceding it: 'forest, timber, or other inflammable material.' So interpreted they make better English and better sense. The purpose of the act is to prevent forest fires which have been one of the great economic misfortunes of the country. The danger depends upon the nearness of the fire not upon the ownership of the land where it is built. It is said that the construction that we adopt has been followed by the Department of Justice and by a number of cases in the District Courts ever since the passage of the original Act of February 24, 1897, c. 313 (29 Stat. 594). We regard the meaning as too plain to be shaken by the suggestion that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly. They also are to be construed with common sense.\n The statute is constitutional. Congress may prohibit the doing of acts upon privately owned lands that imperil the publicly owned forests.

The preceding affidavits did not charge the use of the dwelling for unlawful sale of intoxicants or for any business purpose. The trial court declared the warrant invalid, and rejected all evidence obtained thereby.

The definite intention to protect the home was further emphasized by section 6, Act of 1921\n\n\n It is argued that both the act of 1917 and the later general act are in full effect within Alaska-one a special act for that territory, and the other a general law for the United States and all territory subject to their jurisdiction. But the emphatic declaration that no private dwelling shall be searched except under specified circumstances discloses a general policy to protect the home against intrusion through the use of search warrants. Certainly no adequate reason has been suggested for withholding from those who reside in Alaska the safeguards deemed essential in all other territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The provision of the earlier special act is hostile to the later declaration of Congress and must give way. \n\n[275 U.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion is entirely consistent with established canons of construction, stated and exemplified by Henderson's Tobacco, 11 Wall. 652; State v.

BURTON COAL CO.(1927)\nNo. 100\nArgued: January 10, 1927Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 337, 338]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Maclay Hoyne, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The judgment is for damages for breach of contract by the United States to accept and pay for coal purchased from appellee for use at army posts in the Chicago district. The only question presented for our consideration is whether the Court of Claims applied the right measure. It gave the difference between contract price and market value at the times and places specified for deliveries. Appellant maintains that, upon the facts of the case, that rule is not applicable, and that appellee is limited to recovery of the amount of profits it would have realized, if appellant had accepted and paid for all the coal covered by the contract.\n The facts on which appellant's contention is based follow: Appellant and appellee made a contract as of September 10, 1920, by which the former agreed to take and pay for, and the latter agreed to furnish and deliver, 150,000 tons of coal at $6.75 per ton. The contract contemplated the production of the coal at mines in southern Illinois: 40,000 tons at the White Ash mine of the Johnson City Washed Coal Company, 50,000 tons at the Paradise mine of the Forester Coal & Coke Company, and 60,000 tons at the Freeman mine of the Freeman Coal Mining Company. But it was agreed that appellee might furnish coal from other mines if, for any reason for which it was not responsible, it should be unable at any time to furnish coal in sufficient quantities from the mines mentioned. Appellant agreed to furnish cars and give shipping directions. Appellee agreed to make deliveries on cars at each of the mines in specified quantities per week. \n\n[273 U.S. 337, 339]\n\u00a0\n Appellee is a selling company, and did not own or operate any of the mines named, and did not have any interest in any of the companies owning or operating them. It had arrangements with the mining companies named, under which it, in its own name and under contracts between it and purchasers, sold coal produced from the mines. The president of appellee was also the president and principal owner of the company operating the White Ash mine. It was customary for selling companies to assist in financing mining companies. Appellee advanced the companies operating the White Ash and Paradise mines funds to meet their pay rolls. The Freeman mine was similarly financed by another selling company. Mines in southern Illinois have no facilities for storing coal. The general practice is to load the coal, as it comes from the mines, directly into cars. Appellee delivered the coal to appellant in that way; and, under the contract, 53, 146 tons were accepted and paid for. Appellee was ready to deliver the balance, but appellant refused to take or pay for any more. The difference between the contract price and market value at the times and places specified for deliveries was $4.60 per ton; and this, applied to the 96, 854 tons that appellant refused to take, produces $445,528.40. Judgment was given for that amount. Under the agreements appellee had with the companies operating the mines, its profits on the tonnage refused would have been $46,065.97.\n In support of its contention that recovery must be limited to that amount, the United States emphasizes that appellee had no mine or coal at the time of the breach; that the coal refused had not been mined; that it was not shown that appellee was bound to take or pay for any of that coal or that it suffered any loss because of the termination of the mining and deliveries under the agreements between it and the mining companies; and that appellee made no claim for damages suffered by such companies; \n\n[273 U.S. 337, 340]\n\u00a0\n and appellant insists that the judgment is erroneous because it puts appellee in a better position than if the contract had been performed.\n United States v. Smith, \n94 \nU.S. 214, 218\n, 219 S., and United States v. Wyckoff Pipe & Creosoting Co., \n271 \nU.S. 263\n, 46 S. Ct. 503, are cited and relied on by appellant. They do not apply. Each arose out of a contract covering construction work for the United States. Performance by the contractor was delayed by the interference or default of the United States; and the action was for the resulting damages. The court held that the measure of damages for delay was the actual loss sustained by the contractor. Here the appellant by its refusal to accept the coal prevented appellee from completing its part of the contract. The coal had a market value and it was less than the contract price. The applicable measure of damages is fixed by the rule of law that, where a buyer in violation of an executory contract of sale refuses to accept the commodity sold, the seller may recover the difference between the contract price and the market value at the times when and the places where deliveries should have been made. 2 Williston on Sales,  582. The facts brought forward by appellant do not take the case out of the general rule. Appellee was bound to deliver the quantity of coal covered by the contract. Failure of the sources referred to in the contract would not excuse it. In contemplation of law it could have obtained the coal at market prices prevailing at the times when deliveries were required under the contract. The contract was not for production or mining, but for sale and delivery, of coal. Appellant and appellee were the only parties to it. There was no contract relation between appellant and any of the mining companies. Their default would not make them liable to appellant or relieve appellee from the obligation to deliver the coal to appellant. Appellant's liability is not measured by appellee's losses or gains, if any, under its agreements with the mining companies. Appellee is not entitled to have the full con- \n\n[273 U.S. 337, 341]\n\u00a0\n tract price of the coal not delivered, but is chargeable only with its market value. The difference between that value and the contract price is the amount of damage deemed by the law directly and naturally to result in the ordinary course of events from the appellant's breach of contract. The cost to appellee of securing the coal and the amount of its profits are immaterial. Garfield & Proctor Coal Co. v. N. Y., N. H. & H. Railroad, 248 Mass. 502, 506, 143 N. E. 312; Kadish v.

The court adjudged them guilty and imposed a fine of $5,000. This was paid to the clerk and by him passed into the Treasury of the United States.\n February 28, 1921, this court held section 4 of the Lever Act invalid. United States v.

A demurrer which raised the question of the court's jurisdiction was overruled and the matter came here by direct writ of error.\n The attempt by plaintiff's in error to reserve rights if the Lever Act should be held unconstitutional amounted at most to a protest, possibly sufficient to overcome the suggestion of an estoppel, but no contract arose out of it which obligated the United States to return the fine.

Ed . -.\n On the afternoon of February 16, 1925, the boatswain of a Coast Guard patrol boat saw a motorboat of the numbered type proceed in a southeasterly direction from Gloucester harbor. He followed her at a distance of 500 yards: lost sight of her after sundown, apparently in a fog, at a point about 20 miles east of Boston Light; and discovered her latter alongside the schooner L'Homme in a region commonly spoken of as Rum Row, at a point 24 miles from land. On board the motorboat were Lee, two associates, and 71 cases of grain alcohol. The boatswain arrested the three men, seized the motorboat, and took her with them and the liquor to Boston. There this indictment was found. It does not appear that the government instituted proceedings to forfeit either the motorboat or the liquor. The motorboat which had a length of about 30 feet was registered in Lee's name.\n The boatswain testified that when he discovered the motorboat alongside the L'Homme:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 559, 561]\n\u00a0\n 'I put a search light on her and told those aboard the motorboat to put up their hands. In the boat I found the three defendants, McNeill, Viera, and Lee. I looked the boat over and found a number of cans of alcohol on board it. I searched the defendants for weapons and found none. I put two of my men on board the motorboat, and took the boat and the defendants to Boston.'\n The liquor does not appear to have been put in evidence. The deputy surveyor of the port testified that, upon the motorboat's arrival in Boston, he examined the cases on board and found that they contained alcohol, 95 degrees proof, and that Lee, when interrogated, said:\n'I ran the engine, and the first thing I knew I was alongside the schooner. I did not see any cases on our boat until captured by the revenue cutter.'\n\n The testimony of the deputy surveyor as to what he found on the motorboat, and that of the boatswain as to what he found upon his examination of the motorboat at the time of his command to those on board to throw up their hands, was admitted over Lee's objection and subject to exception duly made.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, expressing disagreement with the conclusion reached in The Underwriter, 13 F.(2d) 433, held that the Coast Guard is not authorized to visit and search American vessels on the high seas more than 12 miles from the coast; that the seizure there made was without authority; that it was illegal, since it did not appear that the government had ratified it by the institution of legal proceedings to enforce the forfeiture; that, the search and seizure having been illegal, knowledge gained as a result of the illegal search could not be put in evidence (Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177), and that the testimony of the deputy surveyor and of the boatswain was wrongly admitted. \n\n[274 U.S. 559, 562]\n\u00a0\n The government contends that the Coast Guard has authority to visit, search and seize an American vessel on the high seas beyond the 12-mile limit when probable cause exists that our law is being violated; that it has authority also to arrest persons on such vessel whom there is reason to believe are engaged in committing a felony; that here probable cause was shown that the crime, a felony, was being committed; that if any search, within the meaning of the Constitution, was made of the motorboat before she reached port, it was valid as an incident of a lawful arrest of persons whom the officer had reasonable cause to believe were engaged in committing a felony; that the constitutional prohibition against search and seizure without a warrant is not applicable to this small motorboat which does not appear to have been used as a place of residence; and that it does not appear that any search was, in fact, made before the motorboat was examined in Boston by the deputy surveyor, within the territorial limits of the United States. where search is clearly valid.\n In the main the contentions of the government are in our opinion well founded. Officers of the Coast Guard are authorized, by virtue of Revised Statutes,  3072 (Comp. St.  5775), to seize on the high seas beyond the 12-mile limit an American vessel subject to forfeiture for violation of any law respecting the revenue. Maul v. United States (The Underwriter) No. 655, decided this day, \n274 \nU.S. 501\n, 47 S. Ct. 735, 71 L. Ed. -. From that power it is fairly to be inferred that they are likewise authorized to board and search such vessels when there is probable cause to believe them subject to seizure for violation of revenue laws, and to arrest persons thereon engaged in such violation. Compare Ford v. United States ( No. 312, decided April 11, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 593\n, 47 S. Ct. 531. The authority asserted is not as board as the belligerent right to visit and search even without probable \n\n[274 U.S. 559, 563]\n\u00a0\n cause. Compare The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat. 1, 42. In the case at bar, there was probable cause to believe that our revenue laws were being violated by an American vessel and the persons thereon, in such manner as to render the vessel subject to forfeiture. Under such circumstances, search and seizure of the vessel, and arrest of the persons thereon, by the Coast Guard on the high seas is lawful, as like search and seizure of an automobile, and arrest of the persons therein, by prohibition officers on land is lawful. Compare Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 149\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790. As the Coast Guard was authorized to seize the motorboat, the search of her by the deputy surveyor within the territory of the United States was, in any event, authorized under section 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922 (Comp. St.  5841h). The failure of the government to institute thereafter proceedings for forfeiture of the motorboat and the liquor did not, by retroaction, render illegal either the seizure or the search.\n Moreover search, if any, of the motorboat at sea did not violate the Constitution, for it was made by the boatswain as an incident of a lawful arrest. Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 30\n, 46 S. Ct. 4. But no search on the high seas is shown. The testimony of the boatswain shows that he used a searchlight. It is not shown that there was any exploration below decks or under hatches. For aught that appears, the cases of liquor were on deck and, like the defendants, were discovered before the motorboat was boarded. Such use of a searchlight is comparable to the use of a marine glass or a field glass. It is not prohibited by the Constitution. Compare Hester v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 57\n, 44 S. Ct. 445. A later trespass by the officers, if any, did not render inadmissible in evidence knowledge legally obtained. McGuire v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 95\n, 47 S. Ct. 259.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. LOS ANGELES & S. L. R.

C., for Interstate Commerce commission.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for southern California by the Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad Company to enjoin and annul an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, purporting to determine the 'final value' of its property, under what is now section 19a of the Act to Regulate Commerce of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, as amended by Valuation Act March 1, 1913, c. 92, 37 Stat. 701, by Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  433, 41 Stat. 456, 474, 493, and by Act June 7, 1922, c. 210, 42 Stat. 624 (Comp. St.  8591). San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad Co., 75 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 463; Id., 97 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 737; Id ., 103 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 398. The bill asserts that the order fixing the final value is invalid, because it is in excess of the powers conferred upon the Commission, is contrary to the provisions of the Valuation Act, and violates the Fifth Amendment. It asserts also that irreparable injury is threatened.\n Reasons why the final valuation is invalid are set forth specifically in 21 paragraphs and 35 subparagraphs of the bill. It charges that the Commission adopted rules for the valuation which are unsound and unwarranted in law; that in the determination of values it ignored facts and factors of major importance; that it refused to report \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 308]\n\u00a0\n an analysis of the methods employed by it, although required so to do by the Valuation Act; and that it refused to comply with the requirement that all values and elements of value be separately reported. It charges that the valuation was made as of June 30, 1914, whereas it should have been made as of June 7, 1923; that the value found is that for rate-making purposes, whereas the finding should have been a general one of value for all purposes; that properties enumerated were erroneously excluded from the valuation; that in making the finding of value the Commission erroneously failed to consider 9 specified elements of value; that in making the finding of investment in road and equipment it ignored 6 items; that in making the finding of cost of reproduction new it ignored 11 items; that in making the finding of cost of reproduction new less depreciation it made 13 errors; that in valuing the lands 11 errors were made; and that in making the finding as to working capital a large sum was arbitrarily deducted. It alleges that for these and other reasons the findings made are incomplete, erroneous in law, and misleading in point of fact.\n The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, and also under its general equity powers. The United States was named as defendant, and the Commission became such by intervention. Both defendants answered; but by appropriate pleadings the United States objected that the adoption by the Commission of the final valuation does not constitute an order within the meaning of the Urgent Deficiencies Act, challenged also the jurisdiction of the court to enjoin or annul the order under its general equity powers, and moved that the bill be dismissed. The motion was overruled, the case was heard on the pleadings and evidence, and, after proceedings which it is not necessary to detail, a decree was entered which annulled the final valuation and enjoined its use \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 309]\n\u00a0\n for any purpose. Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad v. United States (D. C.) 4 F. (2d) 736; Id. (D. C.) 8 F. (2d) 747. Whether all or any of the claims and charges made in the bill are well founded, we have no occasion to consider; for we are of opinion that the District Court should have sustained the motion to dismiss the bill.\n The final report on value, like the tentative report, is called an order. But there are many orders of the Commission which are not judicially reviewable under the provision now incorporated in the Urgent Deficiencies Act. See Proctor & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S. Ct. 761; Hooker v. Knapp, \n225 \nU.S. 302\n, 32 S. Ct. 769; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412\n, 37 S. Ct. 397; United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82, 89\n, 37 S. Ct. 584; Delaware & Hudson Co. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 438\n, 45 S. Ct. 153. For the first 19 years of the Commission's existence no order was so reviewable. The statutory jurisdiction to enjoin and set aside an order was granted in 1906, because then, for the first time, the rate-making power was conferred upon the Commission, and then disobedience of its orders was first made punishable. Hepburn Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  2-7, 34 Stat. 584, 586-595. The first suit to set aside an order was brought soon after. Stickney v. Interstate Commerce Commission (C. C.) 164 F. 638; Id., \n215 \nU.S. 98\n, 30 S. Ct. 66. The jurisdiction conferred by the Hepburn Act was transferred, substantially unchanged, to the Commerce Court, by the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  1, 36 Stat. 539, and, when that court was abolished, to the District Courts, by the Urgent Deficiencies Act. The so-called order here assailed differs essentially from all those held by this court to be subject to judicial review under any of those acts. Each of the orders so reviewed was an exercise either of the quasi judicial function of determining controversies or of the delegated legislative function of rate making and rule making.\n The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 310]\n\u00a0\n doing, anything; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege, or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier's existing or future status or condition; which does not determine any right or obligation. This so-called order is merely the formal record of conclusions reached after a study of data collected in the course of extensive research conducted by the Commission, through its employees. It is the exercise solely of the function of investigation. Compare Smith v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 33\n, 38 S. Ct. 30. Moreover, the investigation made was not a step in a pending proceeding, in which an order of the character of those held to be judicially reviewable could be entered later. It was merely preparation for possible action in some proceeding which may be instituted in the future-preparation deemed by Congress necessary to enable the Commission to perform adequately its duties, if and when occasion for action shall arise. The final report may, of course, become a basis for action by the Commission, as it may become a basis for action by Congress or by the Legislature or an administrative board of a state. But so may any report of an investigation, whether made by a committee of Congress or by the Commission pursuant to a resolution of Congress or of either branch thereof.\n The Valuation Act requires that the investigation and study be made of the properties of each of the rail carriers. There are about 1,800. 40 Annual Report Interstate Commerce Commission, 13. In directing the Commission to investigate the value of the property of the several carriers, Congress prescribed in detail the subjects on which findings should be made, and constituted the 'final valuations' and 'the classification thereof' prima facie evidence, in controversies under the Act to Regulate Commerce. Every party in interest is, therefore, entitled to \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 311]\n\u00a0\n have and to use this evidence; and the carrier, being a party in interest, has the remedy by mandamus to compel the Commission to make a finding on each of the subjects specifically prescribed. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n252 \nU.S. 178\n, 40 S. Ct. 187. But Congress did not confer upon the courts power, either to direct what this 'tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience' (Illinois Central Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Ct. 700, 704), shall find, or to annul the report, because of errors committed in making it. Moreover, errors may be made in the final valuation of the property of each of the nearly 1,800 carriers. And it is at least possible that no proceeding will ever be instituted, either before the Commission or a court, in which the matters now complained of will be involved, or in which the errors alleged will be of legal significance.\n The mere fact that Congress has, in terms, made 'all final valuations ... and the classification thereof ... prima facie evidence of the value of the property in all proceedings under the Act to Regulate Commerce ... in all judicial proceedings for the enforcement of the act ... and in all judicial proceedings brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission,' is, obviously, not a violation of the due process clause, justifying proceedings to annul the order. That to make the Commission's conclusions prima facie evidence in judicial proceedings is not a denial of due process was settled by Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 431 S., 36 S. Ct. 328, 335 (59 L. Ed. 644, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691). It was there said of a like provision relating to reparation orders:\n'This provision only establishes a rebuttable presumption. It cuts off no defense, interposes no obstacle to a full contestation of all the issues, and takes no question of fact from either court or jury. At most therefore it is merely a rule of evidence.'\n\n See, also, Mills \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 312]\n\u00a0\n v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n238 \nU.S. 473, 481\n, 482 S., 35 S. Ct. 888; St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. United States, \n264 \nU.S. 64, 77\n, 44 S. Ct. 294.\n Nor does the fact that 'all final valuations ... and the classifications thereof' are made prima facie evidence prevent the report from being solely an exercise of the function of investigation. Data collected by the Commission as a part of its function of investigation constitute ordinarily evidence sufficient to support an order, if the data are duly made part of the record in the case in which the order is entered. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S. Ct. 185; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 262\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; United States v. Abilene & S. R. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 286\n, 290 S., 44 S. Ct. 565; Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  13, 36 Stat. 539, 555 (Comp. St.  8584). Inquests and inquisitions, if they were expressly authorized, are, at common law, admissible in evidence in judicial proceedings, thus constituting an exception to both the hearsay rule and the rule against opinion evidence. 3 Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.)  1671-1674. Some inquests are at common law also prima facie evidence of the facts found. Hughes v. Jones, 116 N. Y. 67, 22 N. E. 446, 5 L. R. A. 632, 15 Am. St. Rep. 386.\n Congress has provided adequate remedies for the correction of errors in the final valuation and the classification thereof. The conclusions reached by the Commission must be submitted first in the form of a tentative report. Section 19a, pars. (f) and (h). When so submitted, the carrier is authorized to file a protest and to be heard thereon. Paragraph ( i). If such protest is filed, the Commission is directed to make in the report such changes, if any, as it may deem proper. Even if no protest is filed, the Commission may of its own motion upon due notice to parties in interest correct the tentative report. Compare New York, Ontario & Western Ry. Co. v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 652\n, 47 S. Ct. 334, 71 L. Ed. -, decided January 10, 1927. When the final report is introduced in evidence the opportunity to contest the correctness of the findings \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 313]\n\u00a0\n therein made is fully preserved to the carrier, and any error therein may be corrected at the trial. Specific findings may be excluded because of errors committed in making them. It is conceivable that errors of law may have been committed which are so fundamental and far-reaching, as to deprive the 'final valuations ... and the classification thereof' of all probative force. Moreover, additional evidence may be introduced. Paragraph (j) provides that, 'if upon the trial of any action involving a final value fixed by the Commission, evidence shall be introduced regarding such value which is found by the court to be different from that offered upon the hearing before the Commission, or additional thereto and substantially affecting said value,' the proceedings shall be stayed so as to permit the Commission to consider the same and fix a final value different from that fixed in the first instance, and to 'alter, modify, amend or rescind any order which it has made involving such final value.'\n The District Court rested jurisdiction to entertain a suit to set aside the valuation order largely upon the provisions of paragraph (j), believing that such a suit was within the scope of the words 'upon the trial of any action involving a final value.' That paragraph was intended to apply to actions brought to set aside rate-fixing orders in which the question of the value of the carrier's property would be material. In our opinion it is not applicable to so-called orders fixing only valuations. The objection to entertaining this suit to annul the final valuation is not merely that the question presented is moot, as in United States v. Alaska Steamship Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113, 116\n, 40 S. Ct. 448, or that the plaintiff's interest is remote and speculative as in Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 43 S. Ct. 72. There is the fundamental infirmity that the mere existence of error in the final valuation is not a wrong for which Congress provides a remedy under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 299, 314]\n\u00a0\n Little need by added concerning the further contention that the suit should be entertained under the general equity power of the court. Two arguments are urged in support of the proposition. One is that, since the Commission has by reason of errors of law and of judgment grossly undervalued the property, its report will, unless suppressed, injure the credit of the carrier with the public. The other is that the Commission may itself be misled into illegal action by the erroneous conclusions, and may apply them to the carriers' injury, since use of the final valuation is required in making rates pursuant to section 15a of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended by Transportation Act, c. 91,  422, 41 Stat. 456 ( Comp. St.  8583a); in prescribing divisions of joint rates under section 15 (Comp. St.  8583); in determining the limit upon the amount of capitalization, in the event of a consolidation under section 5 (Comp. St .  8567); in determining the propriety of an issue of securities, under section 20a (Comp. St.  8592a); or as the basis of computation of the amount of excess earnings to be recaptured under section 15a. Neither argument is persuasive. The first reminds of the effort made in Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S. Ct. 278, to supress the report of that board. The second reminds of the attempt to secure a declaratory judgment in Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70\n, 47 S. Ct. 282, 71 L. Ed. -, decided January 3, 1927, and also of cases in which it was sought to enjoin a municipality from passing an illegal ordinance. Compare New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. New Orleans, \n164 \nU.S. 471, 481\n, 17 S. Ct. 161; McChord v. Louisville & N. Ry. Co., \n183 \nU.S. 483\n, 22 S. Ct. 165.\n No basis is laid for relief under the general equity powers. The investigation was undertaken in aid of the legislative purpose of regulation. In conducting the investigation, and in making the report, the Commission performed a service specifically delegated and prescribed by Congress. Its conclusions, if erroneous in law, may be disregarded. But neither its utterances, nor its processes of reasoning, as distinguished from its acts, are a subject \n\n[273 U.S. 299, 315]\n\u00a0\n for injunction. Whether the remedy conferred by the Urgent Deficiencies Act is in all cases the exclusive quitable remedy, we need not determine.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. LUDEY(1927)\nNo. 289\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. T. H. Lewis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Wayne Johnson, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ludey brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover an amount exacted as additional taxes for 1917, under the income and excess profits provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916 (Act Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, tit. 1, 39 Stat. 756-759), as amended by the Revenue Act of 1917 (Act Oct. 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 329). The tax was assessed on the alleged gain from a sale in 1917 of oil-mining properties which had been owned and operated by him for several years. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that there was a gain on the sale of $26,904.15. Ludey insists that there was a loss of $14,777.33. The amount sued for is the tax assessed on the difference. Whether there was the gain or the loss depends primarily upon whether deductions for depletion and depreciation are to be made from the original cost in determining gain or loss on sale of oil-mining properties. The question is one of statutory construction or application. The Court of Claims entered judgment for the plaintiff. 61 Ct. Cl. 126. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n271 \nU.S. 651\n, 46 S. Ct. 473\n\n\n The properties consisted, besides mining equipment, in part of oil land held in fee, in part of oil-mining leases. The aggregate original cost of the properties was $95,977.33.1 33Of this amount $30,977.33 was the cost of the \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n equipment used in the business; $65,000 the cost of the oil reserves. The 1917 sale price was $81,200. For the purpose of determining the cost of the properties sold in 1917 the Commissioner deducted from the original cost $10,465.16 on account of depreciation of the equipment through wear and tear, and $32,258.81 on account of depletion of the reserves through the taking out of oil by the plaintiff, after March 1, 1913. There was no dispute of fact concerning the correctness of the estimates upon which these deductions were made. The finding of the depletion was in accordance with the method of computation employed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and there was no objection specifically to the method of computation. But Ludey insisted that the amount of depletion, if any, could not be found or stated as a fact, since, in the nature of the case, it was impossible to determine how much oil was recoverable, either when he acquired the properties or when he disposed of them. The finding of the depreciation was, likewise, in accordance with the method of computation employed by the bureau; and there was no objection to the method of computation. But Ludey insisted also in respect to depreciation that the property was, as a matter of law, unchanged in character and quantity throughout the period of operation.\n Until 1924, none of the Revenue Acts provided in terms that, in computing the gain from a sale of any property, a deduction shall be made from the original cost on account of depreciation and depletion during the period of operation. 2 But ever since March 1, 1913, the Revenue \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n Acts have required that gains from sales made within the tax year shall be included in the taxable income of the year, and that losses on sales may be deducted from gross income. And each of the acts has provided that, in computing the taxable income derived from operating a mine, there may be made a deduction from the gross income for the depreciation and that some deduction may be made for depletion. The applicable provisions of section 5(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (Comp. St.  6336e) concerning deductions to be allowed in computing net income are these:\n'Fourth. Losses actually sustained during the year, incurred in his business or trade: ... Provided, that ... the ... value of ... property (acquired before March 1, 1913) as of March 1, 1913, shall be the basis for determining the amount of such loss. ...\n\n'Seventh. A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property arising out of its use or employment in the business or trade. ...\n\n'Eighth. (a) In the case of oil and gas wells a reasonable allowance for actual reduction in flow and production; ... (b) in the case of mines a reasonable allowance for depletion thereof: ... Provided, That when the allowances ... shall equal the capital originally invested ... no further allowance shall be made.'\n\n Ludey does not deny that Congress has power to require that deductions for depreciation and depletion shall be made from the original cost when determining the cost of oil properties sold. His contention is that, at the time of the sale in question, Congress had not in terms re- \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n quired the deductions in the case of any property and that special reasons exist why the acts should be construed as not requiring the deductions in the case of oil wells. He urges that a corporation organized for the purpose of utilizing a wasting property, like an iron mine, is not deemed to have divided a part of its capital, merely because it has distributed the net proceeds of its mining operations; that this is true even where the necessary result of the operation is a reduction of the mineral reserve; that, a fortiori, the proceeds of oil mining are to be deemed income, not a partial return of capital, since there is no ownership in oil until it is actually reduced to possession; that a purchase of an oil reserve cannot be likened to the purchase of a certain number of barrels of oil; that an oil reserve is not a reservoir; that Congress allowed the deduction from gross income for depreciation and depletion probably as a reward in an extrahazardous enterprise in order to encourage new producing properties; and that to allow the deductions would result, in the event of a sale of the property, in taking back the rewards so offered.\n The government contends that in operating the properties Ludey disposed, in the form of oil, of part of his capital assets; that in the extraction of the oil he consumed so much of the equipment as was represented by the depreciation and disposed of so much of the oil reserves as was represented by the depletion; that the sale of the properties made by him in 1917 was not a sale of all of the property represented by the original cost of $95,977.33, since physical equipment to the amount of the depreciation and oil reserves to the amount of the depletion had been taken from it during the preceding years; and that, for this reason, the cost to plaintiff of the net property sold in 1917 was not $95,977.33, but $53,258.36.\n The Court of Claims did not consider whether ordinarily deductions for depreciation and for depletion from the \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n original cost would be proper in determining whether there had been a profit on a sale of property. It held that no deduction from original cost should be made here because of the nature of oil mining properties. The deduction for depletion was in its opinion, wrong, because oil properties are in essence merely the right to extract from controlled land such oil as the owner of the right can find and reduce to possession; because the existence of oil in any parcel of land is dependent upon the movement which the oil makes from time to time under the surface; and because whether there is oil in place which can be reduced to possession, and if so, how much, cannot be definitely determined. It held that, in the case at bar, the right to explore for and take out oil may actually have been more valuable at the time of the sale than at the time of the purchase; and that, for this reason, the removal of the oil by plaintiff during the years of operation cannot be said to have depleted the capital. It held that the depreciation was not deductible, because wear and tear of equipment was an expense or incident of the business.\n We are of opinion that the revenue acts should be construed as requiring deductions for both depreciation and depletion when determining the original cost of oil properties sold. Congress, in providing that the basis for determining gain or loss should be the cost or the 1913 value, was not attempting to provide an exclusive formula for the computation. \n3\n The depreciation charge permitted as a deduction from the gross income in determining the taxable income of a business for any year represents the reduction, during the year, of the capital assets through wear and tear of the plant used. The amount of the allowance for depreciation is the sum which should be \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n set aside for the taxable year, in order that, at the end of the useful life of the plant in the business, the aggregate of the sums set aside will (with the salvage value) suffice to provide an amount equal to the original cost. The theory underlying this allowance for depreciation is that by using up the plant a grandual sale is made of it. The depreciation charged is the measure of the cost of the part which has been sold. When the plant is disposed of after years of use, the thing then sold is not the whole thing originally acquired. The amount of the depreciation must be deducted from the original cost of the whole in order to determine the cost of that disposed of in the final sale of properties. \n4\n Any other construction would permit a double deduction for the loss of the same capital assets.\n Such being the rule applicable to manufacturing and mercantile businesses, no good reason appears why the business of mining should be treated differently. The reasons urged for refusing to apply the rule specifically to oil mining properties seem to us unsound. If the equipment had been used by its owner on the oil properties owned by another, it would hardly be contended that the depreciation through wear and tear resulting from its use should be ignored in determining, on a sale of the equipment, whether its owner had made a gain or a loss. The fact that the equipment sold is owned by \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n the person who owned the mining rights, like the fact that it is used in one class of mining rather than in another, may have an important bearing both upon the price realized on the sale and upon the rate of depreciation which should be allowed; but these facts cannot affect the question whether the part which has been theretofore consumed by use shall be ignored in determining whether a sale of what remains has resulted in a loss or a gain.\n The depletion charge permitted as a deduction from the gross income in determining the taxable income of mines for any year represents the reduction in the mineral contents of the reserves from which the product is taken. The reserves are recognized as wasting assets. The depletion effected by operation is likened to the using up of raw material in making the product of a manufacturing establishment. As the cost of the raw material must be deducted from the gross income before the net income can be determined, so the estimated cost of the part of the reserve used up is allowed. The fact that the reserve is hidden from sight presents difficulties in making an estimate of the amount of the deposits. The actual quantity can rarely be measured. It must be approximated. And because the quantity originally the reserve is not actually known the percentage of the whole withdrawn in any year, and hence the appropriate depletion charge, is necessarily a rough estimate. But Congress concluded, in the light of experience, that it was better to act upon a rough estimate than to ignore the fact of depletion.\n The Corporation Tax Law of 1909 (36 Stat. 112) had failed to provide for any deduction on account of the depletion of mineral reserves. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 339\n, 34 S. Ct. 136; Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503\n, 37 S. Ct. 201; United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., \n247 \nU.S. 116\n, 38 S. Ct. 462; Goldfield Consolidated Mines Co. v. Scott, 247 U. S. \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n 126, 38 S. Ct. 465. The resulting hardship to operators of mines induced Congress to make provision in the Revenue Law of 1913 (38 Stat. 114, 167) and all later acts for some deduction on account of depletion in determining the amount of the taxable income from mines. \n5\n It is not lightly to be assumed that Congress intended the fact to be ignored in determining whether there was a loss or a gain on a sale of the mining properties. The proviso limiting the amount of the deduction for depletion to the amount of the capital invested shows that the deduction is to be regarded as a return of capital, not as a special bonus for enterprise and willingness to assume risks. It is argued that, because oil is a fugacious mineral, it cannot be known that the reserve has been diminished by the operation of wells. Perhaps some land may be discovered which, like the widow's cruse, will afford an inexhaustible supply of oil. But the common experience of man has been that oil wells, and the territory in which they are sunk, become exhausted in time. Congress in providing for the deduction for depletion of oil wells acted on that experience. Compare Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364\n, 45 S. Ct. 274. In essence, the deduction for depletion does not differ from the deduction for depreciation.\n The Court of Claims erred in holding that no deduction should be made from the original cost on account of depreciation and depletion; but it does not follow that the amount deducted by the Commissioner was the correct one. The aggregate for depreciation and depletion claimed by Ludey in the income tax returns for the years 1913, 1914, 1915, and 1916, and allowed, was only $5,156. \n\n[274 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n He insists that more cannot be deducted from the original cost in making the return for 1917. The contention is unsound. The amount of the gain on the sale is not dependent on the amount claimed in earlier years. If in any year he has failed to claim, or has been denied, the amount to which he was entitled, rectification of the error must be sought through a review of the action of the bureau for that year. He cannot choose the year in which he will take a reduction. On the other hand, we cannot accept the government's contention that the full amount of depreciation and depletion sustained, whether allowable by law as a deduction from gross income in past years or not, must be deducted from cost in ascertaining gain or loss. Congress doubtless intended that the deduction to be made from the original cost should be the aggregate amount which the taxpayer was entitled to deduct in the several years.\n The findings do not enable us to determine what that aggregate is. The sale included several properties purchased at different times. The deduction allowable in the several years for each of the properties is not found. Under the act of 1913 the full amount of the depletion was not necessarily deductible. In order that the amount of the gain in 1917 may be determined in the light of such facts, the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Some of the properties were purchased before March 1, 1913. As to these the term 'cost' is used, throughout the opinion, as meaning their value as of March 1, 1913, that value being higher than the original cost. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The 1924 act (Act June 2, 1924,  202(b), 43 Stat. 253, 255 (Comp.

See Regulations 65, arts. 1591-1603. The 1926 act (Act. Feb. 26, 1926,  202(b ), 44 Stat. 9, 11, 12) has a similar provision with respect to deductions 'allowable ... under this act or prior income tax laws.'

See Regulations 33, revised, art. 159; Regulations 45, art. 169; Regulations 62, art. 169; Regulations 65, art. 169; Regulations 69, art. 169. In either event it would be reflected in the annual balance sheet. After the total of such credits equals the original cost no further deduction is allowed. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The bureau requires that taxpayers claiming depletion deductions shall keep a ledger account in which deductions claimed are credited against the cost of the property, or that a depletion reserve account be set up.

Matthews, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Noveck was indicted in two counts under section 125 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10295), in the federal court for southern New York, for perjury in making returns for the purpose of taxation. \n1\n To the first count he pleaded the statute of limitations. The District Court sustained the plea, and its judgment was affirmed in United States v. Noveck, \n271 \nU.S. 201\n, 46 S. Ct. 476. To the second count he filed both a demurrer and a motion to quash, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense. The objection was overruled. Thereupon Noveck pleaded guilty. He \n\n[273 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 and to imprisonment for four months. He paid the fine and was taken into custody.\n While Noveck was still in prison the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held, in Steinberg v. United States, an unreported opinion, that section 125 of the Criminal Code had been repealed, so far as concerns perjury on tax returns, by section 253 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 268, c. 136 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 v), which makes it an offense willfully to attempt in any manner to defeat or evade a tax. \n2\n The term of the District Court at which Noveck was sentenced not having ended, he moved immediately to vacate the sentence. The motion was granted, a motion in arrest of judgment was sustained, and the court allowed this writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act. Act March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704). After the docketing of the case in this court, the Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its unreported opinion in the Steinberg Case and, reversing itself, held that the Revenue Act of 1921 did not repeal section 125 of the Criminal Code as applied to perjury on tax returns. 14 F.(2d) 564. The government, deeming it impossible to reinstate Noveck's \n\n[273 U.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n sentence by any proceeding in the District Court, continues to prosecute the writ of error. Compare Keyser v. Farr, \n105 U.S. 265\n\u00a0\n\n\n The jurisdiction of this court is conceded. The sole question requiring discussion is whether section 253 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (re- enacted as section 253 of the Revenue Act of 1921) repeals, as to false tax returns, section 125 of the Criminal Code. There was confessedly no express repeal; and it is clear that the two sections are not inconsistent. Noveck's contention is that a repeal was effected, because Congress manifested the intention of supplanting the provision of the Criminal Code, in so far as it relates to perjury in income tax returns, by embodying in the Revenue Act all provisions dealing with the various methods of defeating or evading taxes therein imposed. The argument is that section 253 of the Revenue Act includes within its condemnation any one 'who willfully attempts in any manner to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this title'; that perjury to an income tax return is one manner or method of defeating or evading the tax; and that, since all methods are made punishable under section 253, Congress must have intended that perjury in making false returns should no longer be punishable under section 125.\n The conclusion stated does not follow. The offenses defined in the two statutes are not identical. They are entirely distinct in point of law, even when they arise out of the same transaction or act. Each involves an element not found in the other. Compare Morgan v. Devine, \n237 \nU.S. 632\n, 35 S. Ct. 712. The crime of perjury is complete when the oath is taken with the necessary intent, although the false affidavit is never used. Noah v. United States (C. C. A.) 128 F. 270; Berry v. United States (C. C. A.) 259 F. 203. Compare United States v. Rhodes (C. C.) 30 F. 431, 433. The making of a false affidavit, without presentation thereof, does not constitute an attempt to evade the tax law. See United States v. Rachmil (D. C.) 270 F. 869, 871. The crime of at- \n\n[273 U.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n tempting to defeat or evade the Revenue Law may be committed without verification of a false tax return. Emmich v. United States (C. C. A.) 298 F. 5, 10. Congress, having power to make both the false swearing and the use of the false affidavit punishable (Albercht v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. -, No. 9, decided January 3, 1927), did so. Compare United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78\n, 35 S. Ct. 682; Kennedy v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 344\n, 44 S. Ct. 501. The fact that perjury is a felony, while filing a false return is only a misdemeanor, presented no obstacle. Compare United States v. Lawrence, 26 Fed. Cas. 878 (No. 15,272). There is nothing in the history of the revenue legislation which should lead us to a different conclusion. Our decision is in accord with the view taken by those circuit courts of appeals which have dealt with the question. Levin v. United States (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 598, 600; Steinberg v.

He was convicted in the District Court but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Ritterman v. United States, 12 F.(2d) 849. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court under the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, amending section 240(a) of the Judicial Code, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (Comp. St .  1217). \n\n[273 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n On January 28, 1926, the respondent bought a ticket in Montreal for New York and sought to have a Gladstone bag that he carried checked through to New York. A customs inspector sent there by the United States for the convenience of travellers asked him about the contents and he answered, 'Just my own personal wearing apparel.' Such examination as the inspector made disclosed nothing but clothing and personal effects. The inspector thereupon tied and sealed the bag and attached the requisite manifest. In the ordinary course of events the strings would have been cut after crossing the boundary line and the bag would have gone on to New York and then would have been delivered to the owner without more. Some suspicion was felt however and the respondent was again questioned after entering the United States and repeated that he had nothing to declare. On the train's arrival at St. Albans, Vermont, which is the port of entry, he was called into the custom house and there again stated that he had nothing, and more specifically, no diamonds, to declare, and on the suggestion that he had a quantity in his possession the day before, in Montreal, said that he had but placed them in a bank there, named. An examination of his person was begun and while he was removing his clothes he was asked for the key to the Gladstone bag and handed it over. The respondent continued undressing but before finishing said to the assistant collector, 'I haven't any diamonds on my person; they are in my grip.' Within a few minutes officers who had been examining the bag in another room reported that diamonds had been found hidden there. They were of the amount alleged, were valued at $122,492.43, United States valuation, and were subject to a duty of twenty per cent. Act of 1922, c. 356, tit. 1, Schedule u4, par. 1429, 42 Stat. 858, 917 (Comp. St.  5841a). It does not appear that the discovery was brought about by the confession. It seems to have been the result of search alone. \n\n[273 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n The Tariff Act of 1922, c. 356,  593(a); 42 Stat. 858, 982 (Comp. St .  5841h12) is as follows:\n'Smuggling and Clandestine Importations.- (a) If any person knowingly and willfully, with intent to defraud the revenue of the United States, smuggles, or clandestinely introduces, into the United States any merchandise which should have been invoiced, or makes out or passes, or attempts to pass, through the customhouse any false, forged, or fraudulent invoice, every such person, his, her, or their aiders and abettors, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $5,000, or imprisoned for any term of time not exceeding two years, or both, at the discretion of the court.'\n\n The Judge gave the following instructions to the jury:\n'If you find that the defendant falsely and fraudulently, intending to defraud the revenue of the United States, told Collector Whitehill and Assistant Collector Walsh at the customs house that he did not have any diamonds to declare, this completed the offense of smuggling, notwithstanding that later, while his person was being searched by Assistant Collector Walsh at the customs house, he admitted that he had some diamonds in his Gladstone bag.\n\n'If the defendant intended to smuggle the merchandise in question, he had an opportunity to change his mind up to the time when the obligation to pay or account for duties arose, and if you believe that the defendant did so change his mind and did so declare then it is your duty to find him not guilty.\n\n'If you find as a fact that the defendant had no opportunity to declare the Gladstone bag because it was seized or taken from him, and that his first opportunity to declare the diamonds came at the time when he was asked for the key and before his examination was completed; \n\n[273 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n if you believe that he then availed himself of this opportunity then your verdict should be not guilty.'\n\n The first paragraph of the charge was excepted to and was held erroneous by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It was held that the respondent could not be convicted under section 593. Keck v. United States, \n172 \nU.S. 434\n, 19 S. Ct. 254, was taken to establish that smuggling could not be committed before the moment when the obligation to pay arose; that is, after the duty was established at the custom house.\n Keck v. United States did not decide that a man who wishes to smuggle must wait until he can find a custom house. Its effect is simply that the customs line is not passed by goods at sea when they pass the three-mile limit and have not yet been landed. The statute then in force (R. S.  2865, being Comp. St.  5548) after the words 'which should have been invoiced' added 'without paying or accounting for the duty.' The omission of the later words is explained in different ways by the two sides, but for the purposes of this decision we treat it as immaterial. Here diamonds were clandestinely introduced upon the soil of the United States, and although they would pass a point at which they ought to be examined, they would not have been, but on the contrary would have been secure from further inspection had the trick succeeded. If they had been carried across the boundary in such a way as to avoid a port of entry, we suppose that the offence of smuggling would have been complete when they passed the line, although the smuggler might repent and afterwards report for payment of duties. We perceive no difference because of the accident that the goods had to pass a custom house which the respondent's fraud had deprived of further function if it had not been found out.\n It does not appear to us to need argument that the diamonds were 'merchandise which should have been invoiced' and appeared to be such on the face of the \n\n[273 U.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n indictment. The respondent could not get rid of the duty by hiding them in his stockings and other personal luggage. He could not purge himself of the consequences of his fraud by confessing when he saw that he was on the point of being discovered or, as might have been found, after he had been. The argument that in such circumstances he was entitled to forty-eight hours, section 484(a), being Comp. St.  5841f10, or any time to change his mind and make entry of the goods, seems to us extravagant. Repentance came too late.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. S. S. WHITE DENTAL MFG.

St.  1172a, amending Judicial Code, to review a judgment of that court allowing recovery by respondent of income taxes paid for the year 1918. The sole question presented is the right of the respondent, upheld below, to deduct from its gross income for 1918, the amount of its investment in a subsidiary German corporation whose entire property was seized in that year by the German government as enemy property.\n Respondent is a Pennsylvania corporation, engaged in the manufacture and sale of dental supplies. Before 1918 it had organized controlled, by ownership of all the capital stock, the S. S. White Dental Manufacturing Company, m. b. h. of Berlin, Germany, a German corporation. Its investment in the German corporation in 1918, as carried on its books, aggregated more than $130,000.\n The agreed statement of facts adopted as findings by the court below are so vague as to leave it uncertain whether this investment was represented on the books of respondent by the capital stock alone, or in part by the capital stock and in part by an open account between it and the German corporation. The case was argued on the assumption, which we make, that the investment was represented by both the capital stock and an open account, due to respondent from the German company. The total is conceded to be no more than the fair value of the net assets of the German corporation.\n In March, 1918, the sequestrator appointed by the German government took over the property of the German corporation and the management of its business. It is inferable from the findings, as the government concedes, that the sequestration was similar in purpose and legal effect to that authorized under the Trading with the Enemy Act of the United States Oct. 6, 1917, c. 106, \n\n[274 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n 40 Stat. 411, Act March 28, 1918, c. 28, 40 Stat. 459, Act July 11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35, Act June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977, Act March 4, 1923, c. 285, 42 Stat. 1511, Act May 7, 1926, c. 252, 44 Stat. 406, and we shall deal with the case on that basis.\n In March, 1920, the possession of the seized assets and business was relinquished to the German corporation by the sequestrator. As a result of the mismanagement of its affairs while in his custody, and investments of its funds by him in German war loans, the value of its assets was seriously impaired. In 1922 its tangible assets and its lease were sold for $6,000. This sum was included in respondent's income tax return for that year. Later respondent filed a claim with the Mixed Claims Commission which was allowed in 1924 to the extent of $70,000. What if anything may ultimately be realized from this award remains uncertain.\n In 1918 the respondent charged off as a loss the entire amount of its investment in the German corporation as shown by its books, and in July of that year passed a resolution authorizing the establishment of a reserve against this loss at the rate of $15,000 quarterly, beginning March, 1918. In making its income tax return for 1918 respondent deducted from gross income the amount of its investment in the German corporation. The deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on the sole ground that the loss was not evidenced by a closed and completed transaction in the year for which it was deducted. The tax so assessed, was paid under protest and this suit followed.\n Section 234 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1077, 1078 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 pp), authorizes the deduction in the computation of income taxes of 'losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.' In explaining this section, article 141 of Treasury Regulations 45, provides that losses incurred in \n\n[274 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer's trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit may be deducted but such losses 'must usually be evidenced by closed and completed transactions.' Article 151 provides in part:\n'Where all the surrounding and attendant circumstances indicate that a debt is worthless and uncollectible and that legal action to enforce payment would in all probability not result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a showing of these facts will be sufficient evidence of the worthlessness of the debt for the purpose of deduction.'\n\n And article 144 reads in part:\n'If the stock of a corporation becomes worthless, its cost or its fair market value as of March 1, 1913, if acquired prior thereto, may be deducted by the owner in the taxable year in which the stock became worthless, provided a satisfactory showing of its worthlessness be made as in the case of bad debts.'\n\n See article 561, making these provisions applicable to corporations.\n The case turns upon the question whether the loss, concededly sustained by the respondent through the seizure of the assets of the German company in 1918, was so evidenced by a closed transaction within the meaning of the quoted statute and treasury regulations as to authorize its deduction from gross income of that year. The statute obviously does not contemplate and the regulations (article 144) forbid the deduction of losses resulting from the mere fluctuation in value of property owned by the taxpaper. New York Ins. Co. v. Edwards, \n271 \nU.S. 109, 116\n, 46 S. Ct. 436, cf. Miles v. Safe Deposit Co., \n259 \nU.S. 247\n, 42 S. Ct. 483. But with equal certainty they do contemplate the deduction from gross income of losses, which are fixed by identifiable events, such as the sale of property (article 141, 144), or caused by its destruction or physical injury (article 141, 142, 143), or, in the case of debts, by the occurrence of such events as prevent their collection ( article 151). \n\n[274 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n The transaction evidencing the loss here was the seizure of the property of the German company. The loss resulted to the respondent because it was a creditor and shockholder of that company which, as a result of the sequestration, was left without property or assets of any kind. The sequestration of enemy property was within the rights of the German government as a belligerent power and when effected left the corporation without right to demand its release or compensation for its seizure, at least until the declaration of peace. See Littlejohn & Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 215\n, 46 S. Ct. 244; White v. Mechanics' Securities Corp., \n269 \nU.S. 283, 300\n, 301 S., 46 S. Ct. 116; Swiss Insurance Co. v. Miller, \n267 \nU.S. 42\n, 45 S. Ct. 213; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 242\n, 244 S., 41 S. Ct. 293; Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554\n, 41 S. Ct. 214; Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 122. What would ultimately come back to it, as the event proved, might be secured, not as a matter of right, but as a matter either of grace to the vanquished or exaction by the victor. In any case the amount realized would be dependent upon the hazards of the war then in progress.\n That legal action by respondent upon its open accounts against a corporation thus despoiled would have been fruitless within the meaning of article 151 seems not open to question. No distinction is urged by the government between respondent's investment in the stock of the German company and in its open accounts. It is equally apparent that the stock after the seizure was as worthless as the obligations of the German company and was deductible under article 144 on the same basis as had debts.\n If the seized assets are viewed as the property of respondent, ignoring the entity of the German company, the result is the same. The quoted regulations, consistently with the statute, contemplate that a loss may become complete enough for deduction without the tax \n\n[274 U.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n payer's establishing that there is no possibility of an eventual recoupment. It would require a high degree of optimism to discern in the seizure of enemy property by the German government in 1918 more than a remote hope of ultimate salvage from the wreck of the war. The taxing act does not require the taxpayer to be an incorrigible optimist.\n We need not attempt to say what constitutes a closed transaction evidencing loss in other situations. It is enough to justify the deduction here that the transaction causing the loss was completed when the seizure was made. It was none the less a deductible loss then, although later the German government bound itself to repay and an award was made by the Mixed Claims Commission which may result in a recovery.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. SISAL SALES CORPORATION(1927)\nNo. 200\nArgued: March 9, 1927Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. William J. Donovan, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. W. W. Aldrich, of New York City, for appellees Sisal Sales Corporation and others.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold R. Medina, of New York City, for appellees Hanson & Orth and others.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States seek an injunction to prevent appellees from taking further action in pursuance of a contract, combination or conspiracy said to be forbidden by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Wilson Tariff Act as amended (chapter 647, 26 Stat. 209, chapter 349, 28 Stat. 509, 570, and chapter 40, 37 Stat. 667 (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.)). The trial court regarded American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347\n, 29 S. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047, as controlling, held that no cause of action had been alleged, and dismissed the bill upon motion.\n The bill is confused, difficult to follow, and an excellent example of bad pleading. An order should direct that it be recast and conformed to the established rules. Courts ought not to be burdened by rambling and obscure statements. Nevertheless we think enough is alleged to indicate a meritorious cause and to require reversal of the judgment below.\n Appellees are three banking corporations doing business at New York and New Orleans, two Delaware corporations-the Eric and the Sisal Sales- organized to deal in sisal, a Mexican corporation-Comision Exportadora de Yucatan-which buys sisal from the producers, \n\n[274 U.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n certain officers and agents of the foregoing corporations, and members of Hanson & Orth, brokers.\n Sisal is the fiber of the henequen plant, a native of Mexico, and from it is fabricated more than 80 per centum of the binder twine used for harvesting our grain crops. The annual requirements of the United States are from 250,000,000 to 300,000,000 pounds. During one year 1,000,000 bales-375 pounds each-were imported. Adequate quantities can be obtained only from Yucatan. The plant is extensively cultivated there, and the supply has often exceeded market demands. Prices paid to producers have varied from less than 4 to 7 or 8 cents per pound.\n Prior to 1919 appellee banks advanced large sums to parties endeavoring to monopolize importation and sale of sisal in the United States. The Mexican corporation, Comision Reguladora del Mercado de Henequen, was utilized as an important instrumentality for making necessary purchases and legislation favorable to it was secured. For a time the scheme succeeded; then came collapse. Through foreclosure of liens held to secure their loans (several million dollars) appellee banks acquired 400,000 bales of fiber stored in this country. About that time, through change of laws, the Yucatan markets were again opened; competition became active and prices declined.\n Thereupon appellee banks, acting jointly and within the United States, entered into and undertook to make effective another and somewhat different combination or scheme to control the sisal market, with the ultimate purpose of selling their holdings, recouping losses, and securing large gains. Later the other defendants became parties thereto.\n As the direct outcome of this unlawful combination, conspiracy, and accompanying contracts, it is alleged- \n\n[274 U.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n Appellees have secured a monopoly of interstate and foreign commerce in sisal. The Comision Exportadora de Yucatan has become sole purchaser of sisal from producers, and the Sisal Sales Corporation sole importer into the United States. There is no longer any competition in the trade; excessive prices are arbitrarily fixed. The sisal acquired by the banks during 1919 has been sold; undue profits and commissions have been and are demanded; the conspirators have realized great sums at the expense of our manufacturers and farmers.\n All steps necessary to bring about the above-stated results have been deliberately taken by appellees. Some of them are stated below.\n The Eric Corporation, organized in August, 1919, and owned and financed by the banks, took over the large stocks of sisal acquired by them through foreclosure, also 250,000 bales accumulated in Yucatan. Laws favorable to it were solicited and secured from the governments of Mexico and Yucatan. Under them, and by the use of large sums supplied by the banks, that corporation and its agents soon became everywhere the dominant factors in the sisal trade. Prior to January, 1921, the Mexican corporation, Comision Reguladora del Mercado de Henequen, was the agency for buying and selling sisal in that country; but about that time its business collapsed. Thereupon, the Comision Monetaria was organized under the same laws, furnished with large sums of money. and utilized for such purposes. The governments of both Mexico and Yucatan were persuaded to pass discriminatory legislation and all other buyers were forced out of the markets. But because of the great supply of fiber this plan also proved unsuccessful and the Eric Corporation was obliged to increase its large holdings.\n Later, by procurement of the banks, the Sisal Sales Company was organized to deal in sisal and Hanson & \n\n[274 U.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n Orth became its managers. It took title to the sisal held by the Eric Corporation. The old Comision Reguladora del Mercado de Henequen was revived as the Comision Exportadora de Yucatan, and again became the active agent for buying and selling in Mexico. Laws were solicited and passed which gave it advantages over all others. Under these, and by the use of funds supplied by the banks, it soon became the sole buyer of sisal from the producers. It also acquired the fiber held by the Sisal Sales Corporation on storage in the United States. Thereupon the Sisal Sales Corporation, through contracts, became the exclusive selling agent of the Comision Exportadora de Yucatan in all markets of the world, and agreed to furnish the funds necessary for their joint operations. Appellees thus, and by constant manipulation of the markets, acquired complete dominion over them, destroyed all competition, obtained power to advance and arbitrarily to fix excessive prices, and have made unreasonable exactions.\n Accepting as true the allegations of the bill-roughly summarized above-it is plain enough that appellees are parties to a successful plan to destroy competition and to control and monopolize the purchase, importation and sale of sisal. The Sherman Act inhibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies to destroy competition in interstate and foreign trade and commerce as well as attempts to monopolize such trade. Sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act, as amended,1 declare unlawful \n\n[274 U.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n every combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement, or contract intended to operate in restraint of trade in, or free competition in respect of, or intended to increase the market price of, any article when one of the parties is engaged in importing the same, and give the courts power to prevent and restrain those who violate the act.\n The circumstances of the present controversy are radically different from those presented in American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., supra, and the doctrine there approved is not controlling here. The Banana Company sued for treble damages under the Sherman Act, basing \n\n[274 U.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n its claim upon acts done outside the United States and not unlawful by the law of the place. 'The substance of the complaint is that, the plantation being within the de facto jurisdiction of Costa Rica, that state took and keeps possession of it by virtue of its sovereign power. But a seizure by a state is not a thing that can be complained of elsewhere in the courts.' 'A conspiracy in this country to do acts in another jurisdiction does not draw to itself those acts and make them unlawful, if they are permitted by the local law.'\n Here we have a contract, combination, and conspiracy entered into by parties within the United States and made effective by acts done therein. The fundamental object was control of both importation and sale of sisal and complete monopoly of both internal and external trade and commerce therein. The United States complain of a violation of their laws within their own territory by parties subject to their jurisdiction, not merely of something done by another government at the instigation of private parties. True, the conspirators were aided by discriminating legislation, but by their own deliberate acts, here and elsewhere, they brought about forbidden results within the United States. They are within the jurisdiction of our courts and may be punished for offenses against our laws.\n Moreover, appellees are engaged in importing articles from a foreign country and have become parties to a contract, combination and conspiracy intended to restrain trade in those articles and to increase the market price within the United States. Such an arrangement is plainly denounced by section 73 of the Wilson Tariff Act, as amended.\n The decree of the court below must be reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Wilson Tariff Act Aug. 27, 1894, as amended by Act Feb. 12, 1913 ( Comp.

Hoppin, of New York City, for the United States.\n Mr. Edward P. Sharretts, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[274 U.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding by certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals in the classification for duty of thirteen importations of wool in the fleece and in the yarn. 12 Ct. Cust. App. 557. The certiorari was granted by this court October 12, 1925, \n269 \nU.S. 542\n, 46 S. Ct. 20; a certificate of importance by the Attorney General under section 195 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act Aug. 22, 1914, c. 267, 38 Stat. 703 (Comp. St.  1186), having been filed in the Court of Customs Appeals before the case was decided in that court.\n A similar case between the same parties, involving the same questions and importations of similar merchandise was decided adversely to the government by the Court of Customs Appeals on November 17, 1923. Stone & \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n Downer Co. v. United States, 12 Ct. Cust. App. 62, 45 Treasury Decisions, 167, T. D. 40019. In that case, however, there was no certificate of importance filed by the Attorney General, and no application was made for a writ of certiorari.\n The case as now presented to this court involves two questions.\n First. Is the judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals in November, 1923, involving the same customs classification an estoppel by res judicata against the government?\n Second. If it does not so operate, was the Court of Customs Appeals right in holding that 12 of the 13 importations herein are entitled to come in as wool of the sheep under the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913 (c. 16, 38 Stat. 114), and not as clothing wool under paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Emergency Tariff Act of May 27, 1921 (c. 14, 42 Stat. 9, 10)?\n First Question. It is settled in this court that the general rule by which a judgment estops the parties, in future litigation between them, to question either a fact or a point of law necessary to the first judgment and adjudicated therein, applies to cases of taxation as well as to other subjects of litigation. This was decided in the case of New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 \nU.S. 371\n, 17 S. Ct. 905. That was a tax suit, and the issue was whether the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in holding that the Citizens' Bank had exemption by contract from certain taxation was res judicata, and estopped the city from attempting to enforce subsequent taxes contrary to the same exemption. The court, through Mr. Justice White, said (page 396 (17 S. Ct. 913)):\n'The proposition that because a suit for a tax of one year is a different demand from the suit for a tax for another, therefore res judicata can not apply, whilst admitting in form the principle of the things adjudged, in \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n reality substantially denies and destroys it. The estoppel resulting from the thing adjudged does not depend upon whether there is the same demand in both cases, but exists, even although there be different demands, when the question upon which the recovery of the second demand depends has under identical circumstances and conditions been previously concluded by a judgment between the parties of their privies.'\n\n This is not the rule in a number of the states.

Judge Cooley in his work on Taxation (8th Ed.) says at pages 2648, 2649, that the state courts, differing from this court, do not generally regard an adjudication as to taxes for one year as making the decision of the supporting points res judicata for the following years.\n We have held that where, in a federal court, a judgment of a state court in a tax case is pleaded in a subsequent tax case arising in a federal court, the estoppel from the judgment of the state court will not be given greater effect that it would have in the state court, and that a judgment not operating as res judicata in suits for taxes for another year in the state court will not be an estoppel in a federal court for subsequent years. Phoenix Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 174\n, 16 S. Ct. 471; Covington v. First National Bank of Covington, \n198 \nU.S. 100\n, 25 S. Ct. 562.\n The question here differs from that presented in ordinary tax suits, and involves the effect of an adjudication \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 232]\n\u00a0\n of a peculiar character. Prior to the passage of the McKinley Tariff Administrative Act, approved June 10, 1890 (26 Stat. 131, 136, c. 407,  12 (Comp. St.  5593)), litigation over the collection of duties and the classification of importations under tariff acts was carried on by suits against the collectors who imposed the duties and was in the form of an action against the collecting official as an individual. After the judgment was obtained, the collecting officer was relieved from personal obligation and the judgment was paid from the Treasury of the United States. See Rev. Stat. U. S.  3009-3014. In 1890 new machinery was introduced, by which a board of nine general appraisers was created, which, sitting in divisions of three, constituted in a sense administrative courts of appeals to pass on questions of classification and the imposition of duties, and appeals were allowed from it to the proper Circuit Court of the United States, whence upon an allowance of an appeal by the Circuit Court, the cases came to this court. By the Act of 1891, creating Circuit Courts of Appeals (26 Stat. 826, c. 517,  6), these cases went by appeal to those courts, and then by certiorari to this court. By the Tariff Act of August 5, 1909 (36 Stat. 11, 105,  29), another change was made, by which appeals from the decisions of the Board of General Appraisers were allowed to a new court created by the act, called the Court of Customs Appeals, and by that act the whole question of classification and refunding of duties was taken out of the jurisdiction of the legular federal judiciary. The classification by the Court of Customs Appeals was made final, and no appeal was granted to this court. This independent plan for the settlement of tariff questions and the complete finality of the decisions of the Court of Customs Appeals in that field of litigation lasted until August, 1914, when by the Act of August 22 of that year (38 Stat. 703, c. 267) a limited review by writ of certiorari was given to this court of judgments of the Court of Customs Appeals in cases in which the construction of the Constitution or any part thereof, or any treaty made pursuant thereto, was drawn in question, and in any other case when the Attorney General of the United States should, before the decision of the \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 233]\n\u00a0\n Court of Customs Appeals was rendered, file with the court a certificate that the case was of such importance as to render expedient its review by this court. For five years, however, the Board of General Appraisers and the Court of Customs Appeals between them exercised complete jurisdiction in the construction of tariff acts and the determination of the amount due as duties from every importation coming into the country. By the Act of 1909 (36 Stat. 105) the court was given power 'to establish all rules all regulations for the conduct of the business of the court and as may be needful for the uniformity of decisions within its jurisdiction as conferred by law.' It was by the law to exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases as to the construction of the law and the facts respecting the classification of merchandise and the rate of duty imposed thereon under such classification, and the fees and charges connected therewith and all appealable questions to the jurisdiction of the Board of General Appraisers and all appealable questions as to the laws and regulations governing the collection of the customs revenues, and the judgment or decrees of said Court of Customs Appeals were made final in all such cases. Page 106. It was thus for five years put in a position where in must not only make its own rules, but it must determine, as a practical matter, what should be the conclusive effect of its own judgments in the determination of questions of fact and statutory construction and classification in subsequent cases brought before them by the same parties and presenting similar issues. In the exercise of this jurisdiction, it established the practice that the finding of fact and the construction of the statute and classification \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 234]\n\u00a0\n thereunder as against an importer was not res judicata in respect of a subsequent importation involving the same issue of fact and the same question of law.\n In Beuttell & Sons v. United States, 8 Ct. Cust. App. 409, the question was whether machine-made Wilton rugs were dutiable under paragraph 300 of Schedule K of the Tariff Act of 1913, or under paragraph 294, by virtue of paragraph 303 of that act (Comp. St.  5291). In delivering the opinion of the court Judge Barber, who has been a member of the court since its organization in 1909, used this language:\n'At the outset it should be noted that the precise issue here has been before and decided by this court in Beuttell & Sons v. United States, 7 Ct. Cust. App. 356, T. D. 36905. The government, being of opinion that such issue, which was there decided adversely to its contention, ought again to be here considered, and following a recognized practice in customs litigation, has made up a new record, which for practical purposes results as a retrial of the former case.'\n\n It is clear that this has been the practice since the beginning of the court. See Stone & Downer Co. v. United States, 4 Ct. Cust. App. 47. In United States v. Hurst & Co., 49 Treasury Decisions, 854, T. D. 41584, the court said:\n'Precisely the same kind of merchandise was under consideration in Hurst & Co. v. United States, 12 Ct. Cust. App. 81, T. D. 40021. The record of the evidence in that case is incorporated in this and it is agreed that this case is, in effect, a retrial of the issues involved in that upon additional testimony introduced on behalf of the government, none having been offered by it in the earlier case.'\n\n Provision for just such rehearings was made in the rules of procedure and practice adopted by the Board of General Appraisers (35 Treasury Decisions, 113, rule 22) as follows:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 225, 235]\n\u00a0\n 'Where a question of the classification of imported merchandise is under consideration for decision by any one of the boards and the decision has been previously made involving the classification of goods of substantially the same character, the record and testimony taken in the latter case may, within the discretion of the board, be admitted as evidence in the pending case on motion of either the government or the importer or on the board's own order: Provided, that either party may have any one or more of the witnesses who testified in such case summoned for re-examination or cross- examination as the case may be. The rule shall, furthermore, apply to the printed records which may have been acted on by the courts in the case of appeals taken from the decisions of the board.'\n There would seem to be an analogy between the proper respect of this court for the conclusion of the Court of Customs Appeals upon the question of the estoppel of its own decisions when it was an independent court, not subject to review by this court, and our respect for judgments of the state courts in limiting the application of the estoppel of their decisions in tax cases, and unless some controlling reason exists why we should overrule the established practice in this matter of the Court of Customs Appeals, now that the power of review of some of its judgments has been given us, we should follow it.\n We think that not only was it within the power of the Court of Customs Appeals to establish the practice, but that it was wise to do so. The effect of adjudicated controversies arising over classification of importations may well be distinguished from the irrevocable effect of ordinary tax litigation tried in the regular courts. There of course should be an end of litigation as well in customs matters as in other tax cases, but circumstances justify limiting the finality of the conclusion in customs controversies to the identical importation. The business of importing is carried on by large houses between whom and \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 236]\n\u00a0\n the government there are innumerable transactions, as here, for instance, in the enormous importations of wool, and there are constant differences as to proper classifications of similiar importations. The evidence which may be presented in one case may be much varied in the enxt. The importance of a classification and its farreaching effect may not have been fully understood or clearly known when the first litigation was carried through. One large importing house may secure a judgment in its favor from the Customs Court on a question of fact as to the merchandise of a particular importation or a question of construction in the classifying statute. If that house can rely upon a conclusion in early litigation as one which is to remain final as to it, and not to be reheard in any way, while a similar importation made by another importing house may be tried and heard and a different conclusion reached, a most embarrassing situation is presented. The importing house which has by the principle of the thing adjudged obtained a favorable decision permanently binding on the government will be able to import the goods at a much better rate than that enjoyed by other importing houses, its competitors. Such a result would lead to inequality in the administration of the customs law, to discrimination and to great injustice and confusion. In the same way, if the first decision were against a large importing house, and its competitors instituted subsequent litigation on the same issues with new evidence or without it, and succeeded in securing a different conclusion, the first litigant, bound by the judgment against it in favor of the government must permanently do business in importations of the same merchandise at great and inequitable disadvantage with its competitors.\n These were doubtless the reasons which actuated the Court of Customs Appeals when the question was first presented to it to hold that the general principle of res judicata should have only limited application to its judg- \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 237]\n\u00a0\n ments. These are the reasons, too, why the principle laid down by this court in the decision already referred to, in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank. \n167 \nU.S. 371\n, 17 S. Ct. 905, should not apply or control. There the thing adjudged was the existence of an immunity of the property of a bank from taxation due to a contractual obligation of the state or city government to the bank, a personal relation which might without embarrassment and with much more safety be permanently fixed for one taxpayer than a question of fact or law affecting discriminatingly one of a whole class of importers, and giving the exceptional operation in its favor of a general tariff on articles of merchandise largely imported. The fact that objection to the practice has never been made before in the history of this court or in history of the Court of Customs Appeals in 18 years of its life is strong evidence, not only of the wisdom of the practice, but of general acquiescence in its validity. The plea of res judicata cannot be sustained in this case.\n Second Question. Paragraph 18 of the Emergency Tariff Act of May 27, 1921, c. 14, 42 Stat. 9, 10, under which the wool was classified for duty herein is as follows:\n'Wool, commonly known as clothing wool, including hair of the camel, angora goat, and alpaca, but not such wools as are commonly known as carpet wools: Unwashed, 15 cents per pound; washed, 30 cents per pound; scoured, 45 cents per pound. ...'\n\n Paragraph 19 is as follows:\n'Wool and hair of the kind provided for in paragraph 18, when advanced in any manner or by any process of manufacture beyond the washed or scoured condition, and manufactures of which wool or hair of the kind provided for in paragraph 18 is the component material of chief value, 45 cents per pound in addition to the rates of duty imposed thereon by existing law.'\n\n The respondents claim, and the Court of Customs Appeals held, that all but one of these importations in the \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 238]\n\u00a0\n fleece were entitled to free entry under paragraph 650 of the Free List of the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 164 (Comp. St.  5291), as follows:\n'650. Wool of the sheep, hair of the camel, and other like animals, and all wools and hair on the skin of such animals, and paper twine for binding any of the foregoing. ...'\n\n And that yarn of the importations was dutiable only under paragraph 287, p. 142, as follows:\n'287-Yarns made wholly or in chief value of wool, 18 per centum ad valorem.'\n\n Wool clothing is made from wool yarn prepared either by the carding process or by the combing process. The adaptability of the raw wool for one or the other is determined chiefly by the length of the staple, so that wools used for clothing are often described in the trade as short wools or long wools. The exact question is whether section 18 includes in the term 'clothing wool' long staple or combing wool as well as short staple or carding wool. They are both used in clothing. Carpet wools are ordinarily not used for clothing. They are generally too coarse for that purpose, but are well adapted and generally used for the making of carpets. They are not grown in the United States, so that there is no motive for putting a tariff on them to protect domestic growers or the home markets.\n In the case between the same parties presenting the same issues in 1923 the Board of General Appraisers by a majority of two to one gave judgment for the government. Stone & Downer Co. v. United States, 43 Treasury Decisions, 141, T. D. 39473. One held that the words 'wool commonly known as clothing wool' must be given their ordinary nontrade meaning of wool used for clothing, and therefore included both carding and combing wools. His view was that evidence of the technical or commercial meaning of clothing wool was not relevant and \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 239]\n\u00a0\n was excluded by the words 'commonly known as.' The other General Appraiser supporting the government view examined the evidence at length, and found from it that the first great division among wools was between clothing wools and carpet wools, and that, while in the trade clothing wools were divided into and were distinguished commercially as clothing wools and combing wools, the expression 'commonly known as clothing wool,' as testified by competent witnesses of large experience, included wool for clothing, whether treated by the carding or combing process.\n The Customs Court on appeal held that, if there was a trade term to determine classification under a tariff act, the overwhelming weight of authority showed that it must prevail over the ordinary meaning if different, and that under this rule of construction clothing wool was wool used in the carding process, as distinguished from that used in the combing process in the making of cloth. Stone & Downer Co. v. United States, 12 Ct. Cust. App. 62.\n When the case now in hearing came before the Board of General Appraisers, the board unanimously gave judgment for the importers, following the previous judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals on the same issues in the case presented in 1923, and this action was affirmed by the Court of Customs Appeals. United States v. Stone & Downer Co., 12 Ct. Cust. App. 557. The record contains all the evidence in the first case, and the new evidence introduced by the government in the second case, in accord with rule XXII of the Board of General Appraisers, already referred to.\n In this case, as in every other involving the interpretation of a statute, the intention of Congress is an all-important factor. The greatest light is thrown on that intention in this case by an examination of the existing conditions and the anticipated evils against which by this legislation Congress sought to protect the country. \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 240]\n\u00a0\n When the Emergency Tariff Act was passed we had been through the greatest war of history and were attempting to return to peace conditions, and had reached a time in 1920 when business was bad and financial disaster threatened. The result of the congressional elections in November, 1918, was to change the political complexion of the House and Senate. Before that Congress finished its term in the winter of 1920-1921, an emergency tariff bill was introduced to relieve the agricultural depression which was at hand. Such a bill went through Congress, but was vetoed. The national administration changed on the succeeding 4th of March, 1921. With a new Congress and new Executive, another emergency tariff bill like the one already vetoed was introduced. The Committee on Ways and Means of the new House of Representatives in recommending the passage of the bill (1 House Reports, 67th Congress, 1st Session, p. 1), commented on the serious obstacles to the revival of industry in the paralysis of agriculture. It pointed out, that the purchasing power of the farmers had been in large part destroyed and must be restored, and called attention to the fact that we were in the grip of a nation-wide industrial and business depression and that agriculture was hardest hit.\n Coming, then, to the subject of wool as one of the agricultural products needing legislative aid, the report said:\n'(1) In previous years the average production of wool in the United States was 314,000,000 pounds and average imports 203,000,000 pounds.\n\n'During the war imports increased in response to increased manufacturing to about 445,893,000 pounds in 1919, and declined to 259,618.000 pounds in 1920\n\n\n\n'(2) Both importation and consumption of wool have decreased since May. However, there has been a large increase for January and February, 1921. Importations \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 241]\n\u00a0\n in recent months appear to be speculative, in anticipation of tariffs.\n\n'(3) The stocks of wool on hand were large when the price slump came last May. To the stocks on hand was added the new clip of 280,000,000 pounds.\n\n'(4) The accompanying tables show the wool supply in sight to be near 1,000,000,000 pounds. The normal consumption is about 600,000,000 pounds, with about 400,000,000 pounds carried as stock. A year's supply is in sight at normal consumption. At the present rate of consumption (about two-thirds normal) the supply would be sufficient for a year and a half.\n\n'(5) The effect of an embargo or high tariff would be to gradually increase the prices.\n\n'The justification for an emergency tariff is:\n\n'(a) A fundamental industry that it takes years to develop is facing ruin.\n\n'(b) The prosperity of large numbers of people, not sheep growers, is dependent on the sheep industry. Hence, merchants and bankers who have made large advances to sheep producers are in serious financial trouble and favor a wool tariff.\n\n'(c) At present the supply of wool in the United States is approximately 650,000,000 pounds, of which 175,000,000 pounds is held by the producers. With the coming 1921 wool clip the amounts controlled by producers would be approximately 450,000,000 pounds while the dealers would hold approximately 500,000,000 pounds. Therefore, the benefit derived from a tariff would be equally divided between producers and the dealers and manufacturers. Undoubtedly and tariff on wool would reflect in the price of finished goods and the charge passed on to the consumer.\n\n'(d) Wool dealers who purchased wool stocks at higher prices than now obtain are in serious financial straits and would be directly benefited. Forced liquida- \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 242]\n\u00a0\n tion on the part of wool dealers would make the present bad situation worse and break a trade organization of value to agriculture.\n\n'(e) It can be shown that the price of wool is so small a factor in the ultimate cost of manufactured goods that no large burden need be placed on the consuming public.'\n\n The same report was adopted without change by the Finance Committee of the Senate in recommending the bill to that body. 1 Senate Reports, 67th Congress, 1st Session, p. 6. The bill passed both houses and was approved May 27, 1921.\n The situation as set forth in the Ways and Means report as to the wool market of the world in 1921 was confirmed in a pamphlet issued by the United States Tariff Commission at Washington in 1922, on 'Recent Tendencies in the Wool Trade,' in which it said (page 1):\n'For the prewar years 1909 to 1913, inclusive, the world's annual production of raw wool averaged approximately 3,335,242,000 pounds, of which about 30 per cent. was carpet wools. Of this amount 587,350, 000 pounds were produced in South America, 157,761,000 in South Africa, and 903,620,000 in Australasia, the three great exporting regions which supply the deficiencies in production of clothing wools of western Europe and North America. For 1921, world production is estimated at 2,770,852,000 pounds, of which the three exporting regions above mentioned are credited with 491,269,000 pounds, 127,177, 000 pounds and 798,443,000 pounds, respectively, or a decline in these areas of 231,000,000 pounds from prewar production.' (The italics are ours.)\n\n The Emergency Tariff Act, so designated by its terms, was title I and part of the law of Congress of May 27, 1921, c. 14, which as a whole was entitled:\n'An act imposing temporary duties upon certain agricultural products to meet present emergencies, and to \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 243]\n\u00a0\n provide revenue; to regulate commerce with foreign countries; to prevent dumping of foreign merchandise on the markets of the United States; to regulate the value of foreign money; and for other purposes.'\n\n The Emergency Tariff Act imposed for the period of six months from the date of the act, May 27, 1921, a tariff on the following articles: Wheat, flour, flax seed, corn and maize, beans, peanuts, potatoes, onions, rice, lemons, vegetable oils, sheep, beef, veal, mutton and lamb, cotton and manufactures of cotton, in its paragraphs 18 and 19 on wool on sugars, butter, cheese, milk, wrapper and filler tobacco, appeals, cherries, olives.\n Title II directed a dumping investigation into the question whether any industry of the United States is likely to be injured by dumping of foreign goods upon our markets at less than market value. It provided for a special dumping duty and a means of determining what that should be, and it made that title the 'Anti-Dumping Act.'\n Title V provided for an increased duty in dyes and chemicals which title was to be known as the 'Dye and Chemical Control Act.'\n The whole act was directed to protecting the markets of the United States from being swamped by importations from abroad, and to increasing the revenue. Congress proposed to keep the wool market free from demoralization in the interests of the wool growers of the country, on the one hand, and the owners of wool stocks on hand in the country, on the other.\n It was asserted in the argument on behalf of the government, and the assertion was acquiesced in by counsel for the importers, that at least half in weight and value of the importations of wool from which clothing is made is combing wool. The contention of the importers in this case, if successful, would therefore bring about the result that half, both in weight and in value of the foreign wool in competition with wool produced in the \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 244]\n\u00a0\n United States and with the stocks of wool on hand in the United States, would not be kept out of its markets by the emergency tariff at all, and that the swamping of the domestic wool markets to that extent would continue under the free importation of combing wools. More than this, such combing wools as would come in under the emergency tariff, if construed as the government contends, would produce as much revenue as the carding wools, and yet by the importers' construction that revenue would be lost.\n If the language of the statute is such that such results cannot be avoided, of course, it must be enforced accordingly. If Congress by its language has made a mistake, and so has failed in its purpose, this court cannot supply by its decision the omission of a necessary legislative provision to effect its purpose. With the intent of the act clearly in mind, however, we must see whether it is true that the language used can only bear the construction insisted upon by the importers and upheld by the Court of Customers Appeals, or whether there is a broader and more reasonable construction that can be fairly placed upon the statute which will serve the plain congressional purpose.\n From the 500 pages of the evidence, we find that in the custom of the trade the term 'clothing wool' applies to the short staple wool which is suitable for carding, and which goes into what is known as the woolen or felting process for making cloths of that character, and that the term 'combing wool' refers to wool of longer staple, which goes into another process known as combing for making worsted cloths; that in the trade clothing wool and combing wool are thus contrasted; second, that originally the worsted process could not be used with the fine wools, like the merino wools, because the staple was not long enough, but that the development of combing machinery, particularly what is called the French \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 245]\n\u00a0\n combing process, has enabled manufacturers to comb wool of shorter staple than formerly, and to make it into worsteds, and that, in addition to this, cross-breeding between the merino and other wools has increased the length of the staple and the amount of available combing wools as compared with the carding wools, so that the border line between the use of combing wools for clothing and that of carding wool has changed; that the definitions in the principal dictionaries and encyclopedias set forth the same trade distinction between clothing wool and combing wool as between manufactures of wool and manufactures of worsteds; that both clothing wool and combing wool are largely grown in this country.\n The expert witnesses of the importers generally testified that there was no other meaning for clothing wool but carding wool. There was other substantial evidence, however, from expert witnesses for the government of large experience in dealing in wool, who testified that, speaking generally and in ordinary parlance, wools were divided into clothing wools and carpet wools, with reference to their chief use, and that it was only in the trade in the garding and sorting of wools, and in their purchase and sale that the term 'clothing wool' was distinguished from combing wool. The competency and relevancy of such evidence as to the ordinary meaning of language in tariff classifications is sustained by the decision of this court in Robertson v. Salomon, \n130 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 9 S. Ct. 559.\n The natural and usual meaning of the words 'clothing wool' is wool for clothing. That is what the nonexpert reader of the words would understand, until he was advised of a different meaning by reason of the language of the trade. When, therefore, the words are used, 'commonly known as clothing wools,' the ordinary inference from the collocation of the words is that they refer to wool that is used in making clothing. If Congress had intended that the words 'clothing wool' should have their commercial \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 246]\n\u00a0\n designation, it would simply have used the words without qualification or it would have said 'commercially known as.' It would not have used the phrase 'commonly known as.' The phrase indicates, not only that clothing wool is used in its ordinary or nonexpert meaning, but is to serve the same purpose as the same phrase in connection with carpet wools is the same clause, by indicating that, while these wools were capable of use for other than clothing and carpets respectively, they were to be classified by reference to their chief use.\n In the world view which the committee report shows clearly that the Congress was taking of the wool market, it was not dealing with the processes by which wool was made into cloth, and distinguishing between them. If it had wished to make a distinction based on the process of manufacture rather than on the material which was to be used, it certainly would not have included, as expressly within the operation of paragraph 18, the hair of the camel, the angora goat, and the alpaca, for in preparing those materials for the making of cloth the hair is always combed and never carded. It had chiefly in mind, as shown by the contrast made in paragraph 18, the distinction between wool which was made into carpets and could not be grown in the United States, and wool made into clothing, which could be, and was, grown in the United States and in England, and on the continent, and in South America, Australasia, and South Africa. The world view of the production of wools which affected Congress in enacting this legislation is also revealed in the passage from the Tariff Commission report which we have already quoted when it refers to South America, South Africa, and Australasia as 'the three great exporting regions which supply the deficiencies in production of clothing wools of western Europe and North America.' This use of the words 'clothing wools,' of course, is used only in contrast to the carpet wools, which, together with the cloth- \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 247]\n\u00a0\n ing wools, embrace the whole world production. We do not find it difficult, therefore, in our interpretation of paragraph 18, to give effect to the evident purpose of Congress.\n We are confronted by counsel for the importers with the language to be found in many of our own cases giving controlling effect in classification of merchandise for duty in tariff acts to trade terms and commercial usage. It is these cases also upon which the Court of Customs Appeals relied in reaching its conclusion. Their principle has nowhere been more strongly stated than by Mr. Justice Gray in the case of Cadwalader v. Zeh, \n151 \nU.S. 171, 176\n, 14 S. Ct. 288, 290 (38 L. Ed. 115):\n'It has long been a settled rule of interpretation of the statutes imposing duties on imports that, if words used therein to designate particular kinds or classes of goods have a well-known signification in our trade and commerce, different from their ordinary meaning among the people, the commercial meaning is to prevail, unless Congress has clearly manifested a contrary intention, and that it is only when no commercial meaning is called for, or proved, that the common meaning of the words is to be adopted.'\n\n This statement is supported by a long line of authorities, one of which is Robertson v. Salomon, \n130 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 9 S. Ct. 559 (32 L. Ed. 995) in which Mr. Justice Bradley used the following language:\n'The commercial designation, as we have frequently decided, is the first and most important designation to be ascertained in settling the meaning and application of the tariff laws. See Arthur v. Lahey, \n96 U.S. 112\n, 118, (24 L. Ed. 766); Barber v. Schell, \n107 U.S. 617\n, 623 (2 S. Ct. 301); Worthington v. Abbott, \n124 U.S. 434\n, 436 (8 S. Ct. 562); Arthur's Executors v. Butterfield, \n125 U.S. 70\n, 75 (8 S. Ct. 714). But if the commercial designation fails to give an article its proper place in the classifications of the law, then resort must necessarily be had to the common designation.' \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 248]\n\u00a0\n What we hold here is that Congress, by using the expression 'commonly known as clothing wool,' indicated expressly its intention not to give to the expression 'clothing wool' the commercial designation that it has when used in contrast with combing wool, and that the history of the legislation shows that the trade or commercial meaning is contrary to the purpose of Congress in the enactment of the law. In other words, the authorities upon which the Court of Customs Appeals proceeded, we think, have no application to the interpretation of this act, save as they recognized that in the last analysis effect must be given to the intention of Congress.\n\n It should be noted that the tariff division of wools in 1867 was of three classes: Class 1-Clothing wool, wools which are of merino blood and wools of like character. Class 2-Combing wool, wools which are of the English blood; and the hair of the alpaca, goat and animals. Class 3- Carpet wools and other similar wools. These divisions were continued in the Tariff Act of 1883 (Comp. St.  6172, 6174). In the Tariff Act of 1890 and in the act of 1897 (30 Stat. 151), when the duties on wool were restored after the free wool of the Tariff Act of 1894 (28 Stat. 509), the division was made into three classes, while the tariff divisions between clothing and combing wools were dropped. Again in the act of 1909 there was a division of three classes without reference to the trade division between clothing and combing wools.\n There may have been other reasons for this change in the acts of 1890, 1897, and 1909, but there were two, already referred to, which were obvious, one arising from the cross-breeding of sheep, so that the staple in the merino and like wools was lengthened thereby (see paragraph 380 of Schedule K of the McKinley Act, c. 1244, 26 Stat. 595), and the other in the improvement in the combing process, so that short wools of the merino blood, which before could only be carded, and not combed, became combing wools in the \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 249]\n\u00a0\n trade sense, and could be used for worsteds as well as for woolen cloths. The merino wools were finer wools, and, as they became subject to combing by breeding and mechanical process, their use in making clothing was enlarged and their value was enhanced. See Report of the Tariff Commission on the Wool-Growing Industry 1921, pp. 428, 448. The result of these changes was that the first class of wools in the acts of 1890, 1897, and 1909 included many combing wools, while the first class under the act of 1883 was expressly designated as clothing wools. This is illustrated in this case in which the wools here imported are partly merino wools by the blood and come from South America, and yet 12 of the importations out of 13 are combing wools, while the thirteenth was declared doubtful by the experts, and was held to be a clothing wool by the Court of Customs Appeals.\n A similar change after 1890 took place in the lessening of importance, from a tariff standpoint, of the trade distinction between manufactures of wool the product of carding wool and manufactures of worsted the product of combing wool, for, while the names of woolens and worsteds were retained in the Tariff Acts from 1890 on, these were usually classified together for the same duty.\n In holding, as we do in this case, that the plain purpose of Congress requires the interpretation of the words in their ordinary rather than their commercial or trade meaning, we find full support in a case which was not cited in the opinions of the courts below or in the briefs of counsel on either side. We refer to the case of United States v. Klumpp, \n169 \nU.S. 209\n, 18 S. Ct. 311. That case turned on paragraph 297 of Schedule K of the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 509, c. 349, passed in Mr. Cleveland's administration, to take the place of the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 567, c. 1244. The new act applied to all imports from the date of its passage, August 27, 1894, except merchandise covered by paragraph 297, which read as follows:\n\n\n[274 U.S. 225, 250]\n\u00a0\n 'The reduction of the rates of duty herein provided for manufactures of wool shall take effect January first, eighteen hundred and minety- five.'\n The contention of the government in that case, which both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld (Murphy v. United States, 68 F. 908; United States v. Murphy, 73 F. 1008), was that, under the language of the McKinley Act and the previous Tariff Acts for a great many years, manufactures of wool and manufactures of worsteads were separate subjects of importation, and that paragraph 297, postponing the reduction of duties on manufactures of wool, did not apply to manufactures of worsteads. It has been expressly decided by this court in Seeberger v. Chan, \n134 \nU.S. 95, 97\n, 11 S. Ct. 28, that cloths popularly known as diagonals, and in the trade as worsteds, were subject to duty under the Act of March 3, 1883, as manufactures or worsteds, and not as manufactures of wool. It was admitted that the merchandise in controversy was worsted dress goods, made from the fleece of the sheep which had been combed and spun into worsted yarn, and paid a high duty under the McKinley Act. By the Act of May 9, 1890, it was provided that worsted cloths should be classified as, and with, woolen cloths. 26 Stat. 105, c. 200. That, however, seems to have been repealed by the McKinley Act (United States v. Murphy (C. C. A.) 72 F. 1008, 1009); but, though the words 'wool' and 'worsted' continued to be used separately throughout the McKinley Act in description of the various materials for dress goods, they were classified together for duties. There was no doubt about the commercial or trade meaning of manufactures of wool, as distinguished from manufactures of worsteds, a distinction which exists to-day in all woolen and clothing markets. This court, however, in view of the evident purpose of Congress in the paragraph in question, found that there was no imperative ground for the reinstatement of that trade distinction between manufactures of wool and those of worsted, in construing paragraph 297, although the two terms continued to be \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 251]\n\u00a0\n used separately in the McKinley and in the new act of 1894. Referring to paragraph 297, and its words 'manufactures of wool,' the court said (page 215 (18 S. Ct. 313)):\n'The reason for the postponing of the taking effect of the reduction of duties obviously had nothing to do with the process of manufacture, but related to the material of which the goods were composed, which material had been relieved from duty by paragraph 685 of the act. Congress undoubtedly concluded that the manufacturers of goods from wool had laid in a large stock of material, which equitably they should be allowed a reasonable time to work off, and that there was probably on hand a large stock of goods, to dispose of which reasonable time should be allowed, rather than that the large dealers should be induced to bring in foreign goods at a cost which involved ruinous competition; while at the same time the wool growers ought to have their original market until they could adjust themselves to the new condition of things.\n\n'The specific rate was compensatory, and, when stricken out, and the duty on raw material abolished, a postponement was provided for in order to avoid injustice. But the reason for postponing the reduction on manufactures of wool, which, on the face of the act, we think properly imputable to Congress, is as applicable to worsted goods as to any other goods fabricated from wool.'\n\n And the opinion concludes:\n'We think that the words 'manufactures of wool,' in paragraph 297, had relation to the raw material out of which the articles were made, and that, as the material of worsted dress goods was wool, such goods fell within the paragraph.'\n\n We think the Klumpp Case very like the one at bar. They both consider the same trade distinction between different clothing wools, growing out of the different processes used in the manufacture of the yarn, and reject its application because of Congress' purpose. In both cases \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 252]\n\u00a0\n the trade distinctions had ceased to be important from a tariff standpoint, and classification was made on a different basis from that of carding or combed wools or woolen cloth and worsted cloth. The trade distinctions were very important in the transaction of business, but not in the fixing of duties.\n This court was able, from the language and the circumstances in the Klumpp Case, as it is here, to determine what the purpose of Congress was in the use there of the words 'manufacturers of wool,' as in the words here, 'wool commonly known as clothing wool.' Seeing clearly that purpose, this court held, in the Klumpp Case, as it holds here, that the case came within the exception to the general rule for the use of trade terms in interpreting Tariff Acts. The exception was stated by Mr. Justice Gray in Cadwalader v. Zeh, supra, that 'the commercial meaning is to prevail, unless Congress has clearly manifested a contrary intention, and that it is only when no commercial meaning is called for or proved, that the common meaning of the words is to be adopted,' and by Mr. Justice Bradley in Robertson v. Salomon, supra, where he says, after stating the general rule, 'but if the commercial designation fails to give an article its proper place in the classifications of the law, then resort must necessarily be had to the common designation.' In other words, the pole star of interpretation of statutes, whether it be of Tariff Acts or any other, must be the intention of Congress, when that can be clearly ascertained and is reasonably borne out by the language used.\n Neither in the reliefs presented to us nor in the opinions of the courts below has their ever been a suggestion of a reason why Congress should have distinguished, in its attempt to avoid the demoralization of the wool markets in this country and to increase the revenue, between carding wool and combing wool. The only argument of the Court of Customs Appeals is 'ita lex scripta est,' and \n\n[274 U.S. 225, 253]\n\u00a0\n the answer to the argument must be that it is not so written, and that the language is easily capable of being construed in accordance with the congressional intention.\n What we have said leads to the conclusion that we must reverse the Court of Customs Appeals, except in respect to its ruling on the thirteenth importation, which it classified as within paragraphs 18 and 19,\n And it is so adjudged.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is unable to discern any satisfactory answer to the forceful opinion by the Circuit Court of Appeals and thinks that its judgment should be affirmed. In his view, they rightly accepted the statute as written by Congress; the contrary course would have required them to usurp the functions of a legislator and dissert those of an expounder of the law.\n Nearly 100 years ago Mr. Justice Story announced the fundamental doctrine which no court should forget:\n'Arguments drawn from impolicy or inconvenience ought here to be of no weight. The only sound principle is to declare, 'ita lex scripta est', to follow, and to obey. Nor, if a principle so just and conclusive could be overlooked, could there well be found a more unsafe guide in practice than mere policy and convenience.' \n\n\n\n","203":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. SULLIVAN(1927)\nNo. 851\nArgued: April 27, 1927Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 259, 260]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 259, 261]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederick W. Aley, of Charleston, S. C., pro hac vice, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 259, 262]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant in error was convicted of willfully refusing to make a return of his net income as required by the Revenue Act of 1921, Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 136,  223(a), 253 (42 Stat. 227, 250, 268 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 kk, 6336 1\/8 v)). The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Sullivan v. United States, 15 F.(2d) 809. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n We may take it that the defendant had sufficient gross income to require a return under the statute unless he was exonerated by the fact that the whole or a large \n\n[274 U.S. 259, 263]\n\u00a0\n part of it was derived from business in violation of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/4 et seq.). The Circuit Court of Appeals held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor were subject to the income tax, but that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protected the defendant from the requirement of a return.\n The Court below was right in holding that the defendant's gains were subject to the tax. By section 213(a), being Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 ff, gross income includes 'gains, profits, and income derived from ... the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.' These words are also those of the earlier Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, section II, B (38 Stat. 114, 167), except that the word 'lawful' is omitted before 'business' in the passage just quoted. By section 600 (42 Stat. 285 (Comp. St.  5986e)), and by another Act approved on the same day Congress applied other tax laws to this forbidden traffic. Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 134,  5 (42 Stat. 222, 223 (Comp. St.  10138 4\/5 c-10138 1\/5 e)). United States v. One Ford Coupe , \n272 \nU.S. 321, 327\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025;1 United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477, 480\n, 43 S. Ct. 197. We see no reason to doubt the interpretation of the Act, or any reason why the fact that a business is unlawful should exempt it from paying the taxes that if lawful it would have to pay.\n As the defendant's income was taxed, the statute of course required a return. See United States v. Sischo, \n262 \nU.S. 165\n, 43 S. Ct. 511. In the decision that this was contrary to the Constitution we are of opinion that the protection of the Fifth Amendment was pressed too far. If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was privileged from making he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld. Most of the items warranted no compaint. It would be an extreme if not an extravagant application \n\n[274 U.S. 259, 264]\n\u00a0\n of the Fifth Amendment to say that it authorized a man to refuse to state the amount of his income because it had been made in crime. But if the defendant desired to test that or any other point he should have tested it in the return so that it could be passed upon. He could not draw a conjurer's circle around the whole matter by his own declaration that to write any word upon the government blank would bring him into danger of the law. Mason v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 362\n, 37 S. Ct. 621; United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration ( January 3, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 103\n, 47 S. Ct. 302. In this case the defendant did not even make a declaration, he simply abstained from making a return. See further the decision of the Privy Council, Minister of Finance v. Smith (1927) A. C. 193.\n It is urged that if a return were made the defendant would be entitled to deduct illegal expenses such as bribery. This by no means follows but it will be time enough to consider the question when a taxpayer has the temerity to raise it.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 71 L.

TRENTON POTTERIES CO.(1927)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 392, 393]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, and John W. Bishop, Jr., of Newark, N. J., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, 20 individuals and 23 corporations, were convicted in the District Court for South- \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n ern New York of violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. Act July 2, 1890, c. 647 (26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.)). The indictment was in two counts. The first charged a combination to fix and maintain uniform prices for the sale of sanitary pottery, in restraint of interstate commerce; the second, a combination to restrain interstate commerce by limiting sales of pottery to a special group known to respondents as 'legitimate jobbers.' On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Court reversed the judgment of conviction on both counts on the ground that there were errors in the conduct of the trial. 300 F. 550. This court granted certiorari. \n266 \nU.S. 597\n, 45 S. Ct. 96; Judicial Code,  240 (Comp. St .  1217).\n Respondents, engaged in the manufacture or distribution of 82 per cent. of the vitreous pottery fixtures produced in the United States for use in bathrooms and lavatories, were members of a trade organization known as the Sanitary Potters' Association. Twelve of the corporate respondents had their factories and chief places of business in New Jersey, one was located in California, and the others were situated in Illinois, Michigan, West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Many of them sold and delivered their product within the Southern district of New York, and some maintained sales offices and agents there.\n There is no contention here that the verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence that respondents, controlling some 82 per cent. of the business of manufacturing and distributing in the United States vitreous pottery of the type described, combined to fix prices and to limit sales in interstate commerce to jobbers.\n The issues raised here by the government's specification of errors relate only to the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals upon its review of certain rulings of the District Court made in the course of the trial. It is urged that the court below erred in holding in effect (1) that the trial \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 395]\n\u00a0\n court should have submitted to the jury the question whether the price agreement complained of constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade; (2) that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury correctly on the question of venue; and (3) that it erred also in the admission and exclusion of certain evidence.\n Reasonableness of Restraint.\n The trial court charged, in submitting the case to the jury that, if it found the agreements or combination complained of, it might return a verdict of guilty without regard to the reasonableness of the prices fixed, or the good intentions of the combining units, whether prices were actually lowered or raised or whether sales were restricted to the special jobbers, since both agreements of themselves were unreasonable restraints. These instructions repeated in various forms applied to both counts of the indictment. The trial court refused various requests to charge that both the agreement to fix prices and the agreement to limit sales to a particular group, if found, did not in themselves constitute violations of law, unless it was also found that they unreasonably restrained interstate commerce. In particular the court refused the request to charge the following:\n'The essence of the law is injury to the public. It is not every restraint of competition and not every restraint of trade that works an injury to the public; it is only an undue and unreasonable restraint of trade that has such an effect and is deemed to be unlawful.'\n\n Other requests of similar purport were refused including a quotation from the opinion of this court in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S. Ct. 242.\n The court below held specifically that the trial court erred in refusing to charge as requested and held in effect that the charge as given on this branch of the case was \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 396]\n\u00a0\n erroneous. This determination was based upon the assumption that the charge and refusals could be attributed only to a mistaken view of the trial judge, expressed in denying a motion at the close of the case to quash and dismiss the indictment, that the 'rule of reason' announced in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734, and in American Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S. Ct. 632, which were suits for injunctions, had no application in a criminal prosecution. Compare Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373\n, 33 S. Ct. 780\n\n\n This disposition of the matter ignored the fact that the trial judge plainly and variously charged the jury that the combinations alleged in the indictment, if found, were violations of the statute as a matter of law, saying:\n'... The law is clear that an agreement on the part of the members of a combination controlling a substantial part of an industry, upon the prices which the members are to charge for their commodity, is in itself an undue and unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce. ... '\n\n If the charge itself was correctly given and adequately covered the various aspects of the case, the refusal to charge in another correct form or to quote to the jury extracts from opinions of this court was not error, nor should the court below have been concerned with the wrong reasons that may have inspired the charge, if correctly given. The question therefore to be considered here is whether the trial judge correctly withdrew from the jury the consideration of the reasonableness of the particular restraints charged.\n That only those restraints upon interstate commerce which are unreasonable are prohibited by the Sherman Law was the rule laid down by the opinions of this court in the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases. But it does not follow that agreements to fix or maintain prices are reasonable restraints and therefore permitted by the statute, merely because the prices themselves are reasonable. \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n Reasonableness is not a concept of definite and unchanging content. Its meaning necessarily varies in the different fields of the law, because it is used as a convenient summary of the dominant considerations which control in the application of legal doctrines. Our view of what is a reasonable restraint of commerce is controlled by the recognized purpose of the Sherman Law itself. Whether this type of restraint is reasonable or not must be judged in part at least, in the light of its effect on competition, for, whatever difference of opinion there may be among economists as to the social and economic desirability of an unrestrained competitive system, it cannot be doubted that the Sherman Law and the judicial decisions interpreting it are based upon the assumption that the public interest is best protected from the evils of monopoly and price control by the maintenance of competition. See United States v. Trans- Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290\n, 17 S. Ct. 540; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra; American Column Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 377, 400\n, 42 S. Ct. 114, 21 A. L. R. 1093; United States v. Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371, 388\n, 43 S. Ct. 607; Eastern States Lumber Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 614\n, 34 S. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788.\n The aim and result of every price-fixing agreement, if effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The power to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not, involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable prices. The reasonable price fixed today may through economic and business changes become the unreasonable price of to-morrow. Once established, it may be maintained unchanged because of the absence of competition secured by the agreement for a price reasonable when fixed. Agreements which create such potential power may well be held to be in themselves unreasonable or unlawful restraints, without the necessity of minute inquiry whether a particular price is reasonable or unreasonable as fixed and without placing on the government \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 398]\n\u00a0\n in enforcing the Sherman Law the burden of ascertaining from day to day whether it has become unreasonable through the mere variation of economic conditions. Moreover, in the absence of express legislation requiring it, we should hesitate to adopt a construction making the difference between legal and illegal conduct in the field of business relations depend upon so uncertain a test as whether prices are reasonable-a determination which can be satisfactorily made only after a complete survey of our economic organization and a choice between rival philosophies. Compare United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216\n, 34 S. Ct. 853; Nash v. United States, supra. Thus viewed the Sherman Law is not only a prohibition against the infliction of a particular type of public injury. It 'is a limitation of rights, ... which may be pushed to evil consequences and therefore restrained.' Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20, 49\n, 33 S. Ct. 9, 15 (57 L. Ed. 107).\n That such was the view of this court in deciding the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases, and that such is the effect of its decisions both before and after those cases, does not seem fairly open to question. Beginning with United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, supra, and United States v. Joint Traffic Association, \n171 \nU.S. 505\n, 19 S. Ct. 25, where agreements for establishing reasonable and uniform freight rates by competing lines of railroad were held unlawful, it has since often been decided and always assumed that uniform pricefixing by those controlling in any substantial manner a trade or business in interstate commerce is prohibited by the Sherman Law, despite the reasonableness of the particular prices agreed upon. In Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 237\n, 20 S. Ct. 96, 106 (44 L. Ed. 136), a case involving a scheme for fixing prices, this court quoted with approval the following passage from the lower court's opinion ((C. C. A.) 85 F. 271, 293 (46 L. R. A. 122)):\n\n\n[273 U.S. 392, 399]\n\u00a0\n ... The affiants say that in their opinion the prices at which pipe has been sold by defendants have been reasonable. We do not think the issue an important one, because, as already stated, we do not think that at common law there is any question of reasonableness open to the courts with reference to such a contract.'\n See, also, page 291.\n In Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, this court approved and affirmed a decree which restrained the defendants 'by combination conspiracy or contract (from) raising or lowering prices or fixing uniform prices at which the said meats will be sold, either directly or through their respective agents.' In Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373, 408\n, 31 S. Ct. 376, decided at the same term of court as the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases, contracts fixing reasonable resale prices were declared unenforcible upon the authority of cases involving price-fixing arrangements between competitors.\n That the opinions in the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases were not intended to affect this view of the illegality of price-fixing agreements affirmatively appears from the opinion in the Standard Oil Case, where, in considering the Freight Association Case, the court said (page 65 (31 S. Ct. 517)):\n'That as considering the contracts or agreements, their necessary effect and the character of the parties by whom they were made, they were clearly restraints of trade within the purview of the statute, they could not be taken out of that category by indulging in general reasoning as to the expediency or nonexpediency of having made the contracts or the wisdom or want of wisdom of the statute which prohibited their being made; that is to say, the cases but decided that the nature and character of the contracts, creating as they did a conclusive presumption which brought them within the statute, such result was \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 400]\n\u00a0\n not to be disregarded by the substitution of a judicial appreciation of what the law ought to be for the plain judicial duty of enforcing the law as it was made.'\n\n And in Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 \nU.S. 66, 84\n, 37 S. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322, it was specifically pointed out that the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases did not overrule the earlier cases. The decisions in Maple Flooring Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 563\n, 45 S. Ct. 578, 592, and in Cement Manufacturers' Protective Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588\n, 45 S. Ct. 586, 592, were made on the assumption that any agreement for price- fixing, if found, would have been illegal as a matter of law. In Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Trade Association, \n273 \nU.S. 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 255, 71 L. Ed. -, we upheld orders of the Commission forbidding price-fixing and prohibiting the use of agreed price lists by wholesale dealers in interstate commerce, without regard to the reasonableness of the prices.\n Cases in both the federal and state courts1 have generally proceeded on a like assumption, and in the second circuit the view maintained below that the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the prices fixed must be submitted \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 401]\n\u00a0\n to the jury has apparently been abandoned. See Poultry Dealers' Association v. United States (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 840. While not necessarily controlling, the decisions of this court denying the validity of resale price agreements, regardless of the reasonableness of the price, are persuasive. See Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., supra; Boston Store of Chicago v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 \nU.S. 8\n, 38 S. Ct. 257, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 447; United States v. Schrader's Son, \n252 \nU.S. 85\n, 40 S. Ct. 251; Federal Trade Commission v. Beechnut Packing Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441\n, 42 S. Ct. 150, 19 A. L. R. 882.\n Respondents rely upon Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, supra, in which an agreement by members of the Chicago Board of Trade controlling prices during certain hours of the day in a special class of grain contracts and affecting only a small proportion of the commerce in question was upheld. The purpose and effect of the agreement there was to maintain for a part of each business day the price which had been that day determined by open competition on the floor of the exchange. That decision, dealing as it did with a regulation of a board of trade, does not sanction a price agreement among competitors in an open market such as is presented here.\n The charge of the trial court, viewed as a whole, fairly submitted to the jury the question whether a price-fixing agreement as described in the first count was entered into by the respondents. Whether the prices actually agreed upon were reasonable or unreasonable was immaterial in the circumstances charged in the indictment and necessarily found by the verdict. The requested charge which we have quoted, and others of similar tenor, while true as abstract propositions, were inapplicable to the case in hand and rightly refused.\n The first count being sufficient and the case having been properly submitted to the jury, we may disregard certain \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 402]\n\u00a0\n like objections relating to the second count. The jury returned a verdict of guilty generally on both counts. Sentence was imposed in part on the first count and in part on both counts, to run concurrently. The combined sentence on both counts does not exceed that which could have been imposed on one alone. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the verdict of guilty on the first count was in any way induced by the introduction of evidence upon the second. In these circumstances the judgment must be sustained if either one of the two counts is sufficient to support it. Classen v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 140\n, 12 S. Ct. 169; Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339, 344; Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 250.\n Question of Venue.\n The trial court instructed the jury in substance that if it found that the respondents did conspire to restrain trade as charged in the indictment, then it was immaterial whether the agreements were ever actually carried out, whether the purpose of the conspiracy was accomplished in whole or in part, or whether an effort was made to carry the object of the conspiracy into effect. The court below recognized that this charge was a correct statement of the general proposition of law that the offensive agreement or conspiracy alone, whether or not followed by efforts to carry it into effect, is a violation of the Sherman Law. Nash v. United States, supra. And it was clearly the intent and purpose of the trial judge to deal with that aspect of the case in giving it. But the appellate court held the charge erroneous and ground for reversal because the trial judge did not go further and charge the necessity of finding overt acts within the Southern district of New York to satisfy jurisdictional requirements. Since the indictment did not charge the formation of the conspiracy or agreement within that district, the court was without jurisdiction unless some act pursuant to the agree- \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 403]\n\u00a0\n ment or conspiracy took place there. Hyde v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 347\n, 32 S. Ct. 793, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 614; Easterday v. McCarthy ( C. C. A.) 256 F. 651.\n This part of the charge, so far as respondents deemed it objectionable in that the absence of efforts to carry out the agreement might be taken into account in determining whether it was in fact made, was promptly remedied by an instruction that the jury might consider all the facts in determining whether a combination or conspiracy had been entered into. But respondents made no request to charge with respect to venue or the jurisdictional necessity of overt acts within the district. Neither did they except to the charge as given nor move to dismiss the indictment on that ground. A motion in arrest of judgment was directed to the jurisdictional sufficiency of the indictment but the adequacy of the evidence establishing jurisdiction was not questioned.\n The reason for this complete failure of respondents to point out the objection to the charge now urged, or otherwise to suggest to the trial court the desirability of a charge upon the facts necessary to satisfy jurisdictional requirements is made plain by an inspection of the record.\n In point of substance, the jurisdictional facts were not in issue. Although the respondents were widely scattered, an important market for their manufactured product was within the Southern district of New York, which was therefore a theater for the operation of their conspiracy, adjacent to the home of the largest group of the respondents located in a single state. The indictment sufficiently alleged that the conspiracy was carried on in the Southern district of New York by combined action under it. The record is replete with the evidence of witnesses for both prosecution and defense, including some of the accused, who testified without contradiction to the course of business within the district, the circulation of price bulletins, and the making of sales there by some of the members of \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 404]\n\u00a0\n the association organized by respondents. The secretary testified that, acting for the association, he effected sales within the district. All of these were overt acts sufficient for jurisdictional requirements. In such a state of the record, the appellate court might well have refused to exercise its discretionary power to disturb the conviction because of the trial court's failure to give a charge not requested. If this failure to guard against the misinterpretation of a correct charge is to be deemed error, it was of such slight consequence in the actual circumstances of the case and could have been so easily corrected by the trial judge had his attention been directed to it, that the respondents should not have been permitted to reap the benefit of their own omission.\n Questions of Evidence.\n The alleged errors in receiving and excluding evidence were rightly described by the court below as minor points. The trial lasted 4 1\/2 weeks. A great mass of evidence was taken and a wide range of inquiry covered. In such a case a new trial is not lightly to be ordered on grounds of technical errors in ruling on the admissibility of evidence which do not effect matters of substance. We take note only of some of the objections raised which sufficiently indicate the character of others, all of which we have considered.\n Respondents called as a witness the manager of a potteries corporation which was not a defendant. On Cross-examination, he was asked whether he knew that his concern had pleaded guilty to a violation of the Sherman Act, to which he answered, 'I don't know anything about that at all.' While it may be within the discretion of the trial judge to limit cross-examination of this type, we would not be prepared to say that such a question, when allowed, would be improper, if its admissibility were urged on the \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 405]\n\u00a0\n ground that it was directed to the bias of the witness (Wabash Screen Door Co. v. Black (C. C. A.) 126 F. 721, 726; 2 Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed.)  949), or that it was preliminary to showing his implication in the supposed offense, and thus affecting his credibility. But in any case, we do not think the answer given prejudiced the respondents in any such substantial way as to justify a reversal. Davis v. Coblens, \n174 \nU.S. 719, 727\n, 19 S. Ct. 832; Blitz v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 308, 312\n, 14 S. Ct. 924.\n It was a part of the government's case to show that it was the purpose of respondents, in aid of their price-fixing agreement, not to sell second grade or class B pottery in the domestic market. The government offered evidence, including the testimony of the secretary of the respondents' association, to show that a distinct association of jobbers of pottery was cooperating in this effort and that its secretary had tendered his active assistance to confine the sale of this class of pottery to the export trade. On cross-examination of the secretary of the respondents' association, the fact was brought out that at one time 20 out of 24 members were selling class B pottery in the domestic market. On redirect examination, the government asked questions of the witness tending to show that at about that time the secretary of the Jobbers' Association had been called for examination before a committee of the New York Legislature, conducting a general investigation into restraints of trade and extortions in connection with the building industry in New York City and vicinity, an investigation of which the lower court took judicial notice. It was held below and it is urged here that, because of the known character of the investigation, the evidence should have been excluded because it improperly 'smirched' the witness by showing that he had relations with an 'unreliable' person. But the brief statement which we have given of \n\n[273 U.S. 392, 406]\n\u00a0\n the record makes it plain that the testimony sought was material in explaining the failure of the members of the respondents' association at that time to confine their sales of class B pottery to the export market as promised. The inquiry was not directed to the impeachment of the government's own witness. Its purpose was to dispel the adverse impression possibly created by the cross-examination. An inquiry otherwise relevant and competent may not be excluded merely because it tends to discredit the witness by showing his relations with unreliable persons.\n Respondents called numerous witnesses who were either manufacturers or wholesale dealers in sanitary pottery, to show that competition existed among manufacturers, particularly the respondents, in the sale of such pottery. On direct examination these witnesses were asked in varying form, whether they had observed or noted competition among the members of the association. The questions were objected to and excluded on the ground that they were too general and vague in character and called for the opinion or conclusion of the witness.\n Whenever the witness was asked as to the details of transactions showing competition in sales, his testimony was admitted and the introduction of records of prices in actual transactions was facilitated by stipulation. Whether or not such competition existed at any given time is a conclusion which could be reached only after the consideration of relevant data known to the witness. Here the effort was made to show the personal conclusion of the witness without the data and without, indeed, showing that the conclusion was based upon knowledge of relevant facts. Hence, the offered evidence, in some instances, took the form of vague impressions, or recollections of the witness as to competition, without specifying the kind or extent of competition.\n\n\n[273 U.S. 392, 407]\n\u00a0\n A certain latitude may rightly be given the court in permitting a witness on direct examination to testify as to his conclusions, based on common knowledge or experience. Compare Erie R. R. v. Linnekogel (C. C. A.) 248 F. 389; 2 Wigmore,  1929. Even if these questions could properly have been allowed here, we cannot say that the discretion of the court was improperly exercised in excluding the conclusions of the witnesses as to competitive conditions when full opportunity was given to prove by relevant data the conditions of the industry within the period in question.\n Other objections urged by respondents to the sufficiency of the indictment and charge have received our consideration but do not require comment.\n It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the judgment of the District Court reinstated.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DAVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissent.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The illegality of such agreements has commonly been assumed without consideration of the reasonableness of the price levels established.

WICHITA COUNTY(1927)\nNo. 52\nArgued: December 3, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[273 U.S. 113, 114]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Thompson and J. H. Barwise, Jr., both of Fort Worth, Tex., for appellants.\n Mr. T. R. Boone, of Wichita Falls, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered tne opinion of the Court.\n Appellants Waggoner, a citizen of Tarrant county, Texas, and the Waggoner estate, domiciled in Texas, brought suit in the District Court for Northern Texas against Wichita county, the members of the board of equialization, and the tax collector of the county to enjoin the collection of a tax stated to be illegally assessed. The bill alleged that the tax contested as illegal \n\n[273 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n exceeded the jurisdictional amount; that Waggoner at the time of the assessment, January 1, 1923, was the owner of 12,000 acres of oil producing land located in Wichita county; that the land which was transferred after the assessment to appellant the Waggoner estate was subject to certain oil leases under which Waggoner, as lessor, was entitled to receive as royalties one-eighth of all the oil produced; that the board of equalization, in computing the tax upon the lessor's interest in the oil under his leases, determined that the royalty in the daily production of oil from the leased land, estimated as of January 1, 1923, would be 723 barrels per day; and that the total value of such oil was $1, 000 per barrel of daily production thus estimated or $723,000. The bill assailed the tax assessed as illegal and in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that appellant's interest in the oil leases up to $718,300 of the assessed value had been erroneously treated for taxing purposes as real estate in Wichita county, instead of personal property taxable in Tarrant county, where the lessor resided; that in valuing this interest appellees had intentionally and systematically applied a higher, rate than upon similar property in the county, thus denying appellants the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The judgment of the district court, dismissing the bill after a trial ( 298 F. 818), was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (3 F.(2d) 962). Both courts held that the interest taxed was realty, and hence subject to tax in Wichita county, where the leased lands were situated. They held also that the assessment was not discriminatory and did not violate the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the tax was assessed on appellant at the rate of $1,000 per barrel on the estimated daily production and the interests of the several lessees in the oil under the various leases were \n\n[273 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n valued at $450 per barrel, it was held that there was substantial basis for the difference in the rate, since the entire expense and risk incident to production were borne by the lessees.\n The case comes here on appeal allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The jurisdiction of the district court was invoked on the sole ground that substantial constitutional questions were involved. Hence a direct appeal should have been taken from the District Court to this court. Judicial Code,  238, before amended (Comp. St.  1215); Union & Planters' Bank v. Memphis, \n189 \nU.S. 71, 73\n, 23 S. Ct. 604; Carolina Glass Co. v. Murray, \n240 \nU.S. 305, 318\n, 36 S. Ct. 293; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 42 S. Ct. 244. Having been erroneously brought to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the case should have been transferred to this court. Judicial Code,  238(a), being Comp. St.  1215a, before the amendment of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 938). But, as the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals was allowed within three months after the entry of judgment in the District Court, the present appeal will operate effectively to lodge the case in this court for its decision, without the needless ceremony of remanding the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals to enable that court to transfer it back to us for a second consideration.

Treating this as a direct appeal from the District Court in a case where the sole ground of its jurisdiction was the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, we may limit our decision to either federal or state questions which dispose of the case. Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478, 482\n, 42 S. Ct. 164; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry., \n270 \nU.S. 378, 387\n, 46 S. Ct. 236.\n That there was a basis for discrimination in valuing the lessor's and lessees' interests in the oil is not questioned here. But appellants insist that it was erroneous to tax the lessor's interest as realty in Wichita county, instead of personalty taxable in Tarrant county, the residence of the taxpayer. As they rely on the allegation in the bill \n\n[273 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n that the board intentionally and systematically exempted from taxation other personal property in Wichita county, it is implicit in this contention that the taxing authorities, by treating these interests as realty instead of personalty, denied them the equal protection of the laws. But we find it unnecessary to deal with the constitutional aspect of the question as we conclude that the interest was properly taxable as realty.\n Whether realty or personalty is a question of local law upon which the local decisions and statutes control. Edward Hines, Trustees v. Martin, \n268 \nU.S. 458, 462\n, 45 S. Ct. 543. Under article 7510, Complete Tex. Stat. 1920, all real estate is taxable in the county where located.\n It is the contention of appellants that by the law of Texas, minerals, including oil in place in the soil may by appropriate deed or conveyance be severed from the remainder of the land and granted in full ownership; that Waggoner by the several leases of the lands in question conveyed the entire interest in the oil to the lessees; hence the royalty provisions in the leases are at most contractual obligations of the lessees to deliver to the lessor a part of the oil when removed from the earth; and that such contractual rights are personalty, taxable in the county of the domicile of the obligee.\n Assuming, as appellants contend, that mineral rights may be thus severed and conveyed (Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil & Gas Co., 113 Tex. 160, 254 S. W. 290, 29 A. L. R. 566; Texas Co. v. Daugherty, 107 Tex. 227, 176 S. W. 717, L. R. A. 1917F, 989), the question remains whether the present leases purport to convey to the lessees all rights in the oil in the leased lands, or whether they reserve in the lessor an undivided one- eighth share. All the leases are in substantially the same form. They recite that in consideration of a money payment and the lessees' covenants, the lessor leases the described lands 'for the sole and only purpose of drilling and mining for gas and oil.' The lessees covenant:\n\n\n[273 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n 'To deliver to the lessor, free of charge, in the pipe line to which said lease may be connected, the equal one-eighth part of all the oil and gas produced on said premises, settlement to be made not later than the tenth day of each month for the preceding month.\n'That the lessee will pay seven-eighths of all increase in taxes, by virtue of gas and oil, or either, that may be assessed against said premises.'\n\n It is to be noted that the leases contain no words of grant of the minerals as such, but the lands are demised solely for the purpose of drilling and mining. The lessees are in terms given neither title, right of appropriation nor power of disposition of the share of the oil which is to be delivered to the lessor when severed from the soil. The covenant of the lessees to pay seven-eighths of all increase in tax 'by virtue of gas and oil' is inconsistent with the contention that the lessor retained no interest in the minerals in place in the soil.\n In the absence of controlling authority in the Texas courts, we can find in the terms of the leases themselves no basis for the contention that the lessor granted or conveyed away his entire interest in the oil. The case of Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil & Gas Co., supra, is relied upon by appellants, but in that case the lease, in other respects similar to those now under consideration, provided that the lessee at his option should pay the stipulated royalties in oil or cash. It thus conferred on the lessee the essentials of ownership-possession, with unrestricted power of appropriation and disposition of the oil. The lessee was therefore properly taxed as owner. The considerations which led to that result lead to the conclusion here that the ownership of the royalty oil remained in the lessor who retained the power of disposition and the right to receive possession, and that his interest was properly taxed as realty.\n This conclusion is supported by the decision of the Texas courts in Japhet v. McRae (Tex. Com. App.) 276 S. W. 669, indicat- \n\n[273 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n ing that the lessor's right to an oil lease royalty, although not specifically mentioned, is embraced in a conveyance of the land by the lessor, so that upon the subdivision of the land, the respective grantees acquire the right to the royalty in all oil produced on the granted land. Compare the decision of the Texas courts in Jones v. O'Brien (Tex. Com. App.) 251 S. W. 208 and O'Brien v. Jones (Tex. Civ. App.) 274 S. W. 242, for the application of the statute of frauds to sales of the lessor's interest in leased lands. See, also, United States v. Noble, \n237 \nU.S. 74, 80\n, 35 S. Ct. 532; Barnsdall v.

CHIN BOW(1927)\nNo. 237\nArgued: March 16, 1927Decided: June 6, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 657, 658]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Alfred A. Wheat, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., and Frank M. Parrish, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, and Clement L. Bouve, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affirming an order of the District Court for the Western District of Washington allowing a writ of habeas corpus for Chin Bow, a chinese boy 10 years of age, and granting him a discharge. The petition for certiorari was filed October 29, 1925, and granted December 7, 1925 (\n269 \nU.S. 550\n, 46 S. Ct. 120), under section 240(a) of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. (Comp. St.  1217).\n Chin Bow applied for admission to the United States at Seattle. The board of special inquiry of the Immigration Bureau at that place denied him admission on the ground that, though his father is a citizen, he is not a citizen, because at the time of his birth in China his father had never resided in the United States. Chin Bow was born March 29, 1914, in China. His father, Chin Dun, \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 659]\n\u00a0\n was also born in China on March 8, 1894, and had never been in this country until July 18, 1922. Chin Dun was the son of Chin Tong, the respondent's grandfather. Chin Tong is 49 years old, and was born in the United States.\n The Secretary of Labor affirmed the decision of the board of inquiry, and the deportation of the respondent was ordered. He secured a writ of habeas corpus from the District Court. Upon a hearing, an order discharging him was entered without an opinion. On appeal by the United States, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court (7 F.(2) 369), holding him to be a citizen under the provisions of section 1993 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  3947), which is as follows:\n'All children heretofore born or hereafter born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, whose fathers were or may be at the time of their birth citizens thereof, are declared to be citizens of the United States; but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to children whose fathers never resided in the United States.'\n\n The rights of Chin Bow are determined by the construction of this section. The Secretary of Labor, April 27, 1916, asked the opinion of Attorney General Gregory whether a rule of the Chinese regulations of his Department, which denied citizenship to foreign-born children of American Chinese, was a valid one. He advised that it was not, because section 1993 applied to all children and therefore included Chinese children as well. The second question was whether foreign-born children of American-born Chinese fathers were entitled to enter the United States as citizens thereof, when they had continued to reside for some time in China after reaching their majorities, without any affirmative action on their part indicating an intention to remain citizens of the United States, and the Attorney General advised that they were, in spite of \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 660]\n\u00a0\n these circumstances, entitled to enter the United States as citizens thereof, 30 Op. Attys. Gen. 529.\n The United States contends that the proviso of section 1993, 'but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to children whose fathers never resided in the United States,' must be construed to mean that only the children whose fathers have resided in the United States before their birth become citizens under the section. It is claimed for the respondent that the residence of the father at any time in the United States before his death entitles his son whenever born to citizenship. These conflicting claims make the issue to be decided.\n The very learned and useful opinion of Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649\n, 18 S. Ct. 456, establishes that at common law in England and the United States the rule with respect to nationality was that of the jus soli, that birth within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Crown, and of the United States, as the successor of the Crown, fixed nationality, and that there could be no change in this rule of law except by statute; that by the statute of 7 Anne (1708) c. 5,  3, extended by the statute of 4 George II (1731) c. 21, all children born out of the ligeance of the Crown of England whose fathers were or should be natural-born subjects of the Crown of England, or of Great Britain, at the time of the birth of such children, respectively, were deemed natural-born subjects of that kingdom to all intents and purposes whatsoever. That statute was extended by the statute of 13 George III (1773) c. 21, to foreign-born grandchildren of natural-born subjects but not to the issue of such grandchildren. \n169 \nU.S. 671\n, 18 S. Ct. 456. De Geer v. Stone, 22 Ch. D. 243, 252; Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 178, 781. The latter author says (page 782) that British nationality did not pass by descent or inheritance beyond the second generation. These statutes applied to the colonies before the War of Independence. \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 661]\n\u00a0\n The Act of March 26, 1790, entitled 'An act to establish an uniform rule of naturalization' (1 Stat. 103, c. 3), came under discussion in February, 1790, in the House, but the discussion was chiefly directed to naturalization and not to the status of children of American citizens born abroad. Annals of First Congress, 1109, 1110, et seq. The only reference is made by Mr. Burke (page 1121) in which he says:\n'The case of the children of American parents born abroad ought to be provided for, as was done in the case of English parents in the 12th year of William III. There are several other cases that ought to be likewise attended to.'\n\n Mr. Hartley said (page 1125) that he had another clause ready to present providing for the children of American citizens born out of the United States. A select committee of ten was then appointed to which the bill was recommitted and from which it was reported. But no subsequent reference to the provision of the bill which we are now considering appears. The bill as passed was as follows:\n'An Act to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.\n\n'Section 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that any alien, being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof, on application to any common law court of record, in any one of the states wherein he shall have resided for the term of one year at least, and making proof to the satisfaction of such court, that he is a person of good character, and taking the oath or affirmation prescribed by law, to support the Constitution of the United States, which oath or affirmation such court shall administer; \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 662]\n\u00a0\n and the clerk of such court shall record such application, and the proceedings thereon; and thereupon such person shall be considered as a citizen of the United States. And the children of such persons so naturalized, dwelling within the United States, being under the age of twenty-one years at the time of such naturalization, shall also be considered as citizens of the United States. And the children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural-born citizens: Provided, that the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States: Provided also, that no person heretofore proscribed by any state, shall be admitted a citizen as aforesaid, except by an act of the Legislature of the state in which such person was proscribed.'\n\n This act was repealed by the Act of January 29, 1795, 1 Stat. 415,  4, but the third section of that act re-enacted the provisions of the Act of 1790 as to children of citizens born beyond the sea, in equivalent terms. The clauses were not repealed by the next Naturalization Act of June 18, 1798, 1 Stat. 566, but continued in force until the 14th of April, 1802, when an Act of Congress of that date, 2 Stat. 153, repealed all preceding acts respecting naturalization. After its provision as to naturalization, it contained in its fourth section the following:\n'That the children of persons duly naturalized under any of the laws of the United States, or who, provious to the passing to any law on that subject, by the government of the United States, may have become citizens of any one of the said states, under the laws thereof, being under the age of twenty-one years, at the time of their parents being so naturalized or admitted to the rights of citizenship, shall, if dwelling in the United States, be considered as citizens of the United States, and the children of persons who now are, or have been citizens of the \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 663]\n\u00a0\n United States, shall, though born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, be considered as citizens of the United States: Provided, that the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never resided within the United States.'\n\n No change was made in the law until 1855. Mr. Horace Binney had written an article, which he published December 1, 1853, for the satisfaction of fellow citizens and friends, whose children were born abroad during occasional visits by their parents to Europe. \n169 \nU.S. 665\n, 18 S. Ct. 456, 2 Amer. Law Reg. 193. He began the article as follows:\n'It does not, probably, occur to the American families who are visiting Europe in great numbers, and remaining there, frequently for a year or more, that all their children born in a foreign country are aliens, and when they return home will return under all the disabilities of aliens. Yet this is indisputably the case; for it is not worth while to consider the only exception to this rule that exists under the laws of the United States, viz. the case of a child so born, whose parents were citizens of the United States on or before the 14th day of April, 1802\n\n\n\n'It has been thought expedient, therefore, to call the attention of the public to this state of the laws of the United States that, if there are not some better political reasons for permitting the law so to remain than the writer is able to imagine, the subject may be noticed in Congress and a remedy provided.'\n\n Mr. Binney demonstrates that under the law then existing, the children of citizens of the United States born abroad, and whose parents were not citizens of the United States on or before the 14th of April, 1802, were aliens, becuase the Act of 1802 only applied to such parents, and because under the common law which applied in this country, the children of citizens born abroad were not citizens, but were aliens. Mr. Binney was not interested \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 664]\n\u00a0\n in the citizenship of the second generation of children of citizens of the United States born abroad, and nothing in this article was directed to the question of the meaning of the words contained in the Act of 1802, 'provided, that the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never resided within the United States.'\n The Act of February 10, 1855, 10 Stat. 604, passed presumably because of Mr. Binney's suggestion, was entitled 'An act to secure the right of citizenship to children of citizens of the United States born out of the limits thereof,' and read as follows:\n'That persons heretofore born, or hereafter to be born, out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, whose fathers were or shall be at the time of their birth citizens of the United States, shall be deemed and considered and are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided, however, that the rights of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers never resided in the United States.\n\n'Sec. 2. ... That any woman who might lawfully be naturalized under the existing laws, married, or who shall be married to a citizen of the United States, shall be deemed and taken to be a citizen.'\n\n The part of the Act of 1855 we are interested in was embodied in the Revised Statutes as section 1993.\n It is very clear that the proviso in section 1993 has the same meaning as that which Congress intended to give it in the Act of 1790, except that it was then retrospective as it was in the Act of 1802, while in the Act of 1855 it was intended to be made prospective as well as retrospective. What was the source of the peculiar words of the proviso there seems to be no way of finding out, as the report of the discussion of the subject is not contained in any publication brought to our attention. It is evident, how- \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 665]\n\u00a0\n ever, from the discussion in the First Congress, already referred to, that there was a strong feeling in favor of the encouragement of naturalization. There were some congressmen, although they did not prevail, who were in favor of naturalization by the mere application and taking of the oath. The time required for residence to obtain naturalization was finally limited to two years. In the Act of 1795 this was increased to five years, with three years for declaration of intention. Congress must have thought that the questions of naturalization and of the conferring of citizenship on sons of American citizens born abroad were related.\n Congress had before it the Act of George III of 1773 which conferred British Nationality not only on the children but also on the grandchildren of British born citizens who were born abroad. Congress was not willing to make so liberal a provision. It was natural that it should wish to restrict the English provision, because at the time that this phrase was adopted there were doubtless many foreign-born children of persons was were citizens of the seceding colonies, with respect to whose fathers there was a natural doubt whether they intended to claim or enjoy American citizenship or indeed were entitled to it. The last provision of the Act of 1790 manifested this disposition to exclude from the operation of the act those who were citizens or subjects in the states during the Revolution and had been proscribed by thier Legislatures. It is not too much to say, therefore, that Congress at that time attached more importance to actual residence in the United States as indicating a basis for citizenship than it did to descent from those who had been born citizens of the colonies or of the states before the Constitution. As said by Mr. Fish, when Secretary of State, to Minister Washburn, June 28, 1873, in speaking of this very proviso, 'The heritable blood of citizenship \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 666]\n\u00a0\n was thus associated unmistakably with residence within the country which was thus recognized as essential to full citizenship.' Foreign Relations of the United States, pt. 1, 1873, page 259. It is in such an atmosphere that we are to interpret the meaning of this peculiarly worded proviso.\n Only two constructions seem to us possible, and we must adopt one or the other. The one is that the descent of citizenship shall be regarded as taking place at the birth of the person to whom it is to be transmitted, and that the words, 'have never been resident in the United States,' refer in point of time to the birth of the person of whom the citizenship is to descend. This is the adoption of the rule of jus sanguinis in respect to citizenship, and that emphasizes the fact and time of birth as the basis of it. We think the words, 'the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States,' are equivalent to saying that fathers may not have the power of transmitting by descent the right of citizenship until they shall become residents in the United States. The other view is that the words, 'have never been resident in the United States,' have reference to the whole life of the father until his death, and therefore that grandchildren of native-born citizens, even after they, having been born abroad, have lived abroad to middle age and without residing at all in the United States, will become citizens, if their fathers born abroad and living until old age abroad shall adopt a residence in the United States just before death. We are thus to have two generations of citizens who have been born abroad, lived abroad, the first coming to old age, and the second to maturity, and bringing up of a family without any relation to the United States at all until the father shall in his last days adopt a new residence. We do not think that such a construction accords with the probable attitude of Congress at the time of the adoption of this proviso into the statute. Its con- \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 667]\n\u00a0\n struction extends citizenship to a generation whose birth, minority, and majority, whose education, and whose family life have all been out of the United States and naturally within the civilization and environment of an alien country. The beneficiaries would have evaded the duties and responsibilities of American citizenship. They might be persons likely to become public charges or afflicted with disease; yet they would be entitled to enter as citizens of the United States. Van Dyne, Citizenship of the United States, p. 34.\n As between the two interpretations, we feel confident that the first one was more in accord with the views of the First Congress. We think that the proviso has been so construed by a subsequent Act of Congress of March 2, 1907, c. 2534,  6, 34 Stat. 1229 (Comp. St.  3963), which provides:\n'That all children born outside the limits of the United States who are citizens thereof in accordance with the provisions of section 1993 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and who continue to reside outside the United States shall, in order to receive the United of this government, be required upon reaching the age of eighteen years to record at an American consulate their intention to become residents and remain citizens of the United States and shall be further required to take the oath of allegiance to the United States upon attaining their majority.'\n\n Now if this Congress had construed section 1993 to permit the residence prescribed to occur after the birth of such children, we think that it would have employed appropriate words to express such meaning, as for example, 'all children born who are or may become citizens.' The present tense is used, however, indicating that citizenship is determined at the time of birth. Moreover, such foreign-born citizens are required, upon reaching the age of cighteen years, to record their intention to become residents and remain citizens of the United States and take \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 668]\n\u00a0\n the oath of allegiance to the United States upon attaining their majority. If the residence prescribed for the parent may occur after the birth of the children, the father may remain abroad and not reside in the United States until long after such children attain their majority. Thus they could not register or take the oath of allegiance, because the rights of citizenship could not descend to them until their fathers had resided in the United States. This class of foreign-born children of American citizens could not, then, possibly comply with the provisions of the Act of 1907. Nor could such children 'remain citizens,' since they are expressly denied the rights of citizenship. We may treat the Act of 1907 as being in pari materia with the original act, and as a legislative declaration of what Congress in 1907 thought was its meaning in 1790. United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 564, et seq.; Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 11 S. Ct. 222.\n Counsel for the respondent insist that the Act of 1907 is not an act that reflects on the construction to be placed on section 1993; that there is a distinction between citizenship and the enjoyment of it in this country on the one hand and the rules that should limit the protection of it abroad by our government on the other. This may well be conceded. It is illustrated in the opinion of Attorney General Hoar, 13 Op. Attys. Gen. 90, in which he advised that, even if applicants were citizens, they were not entitled to the protection of passports under the circumstances of that case. But we do not think that this distinction detracts from the argumentative weight of the Act of 1907 as a Congressional interpretation of the proviso of 1855, 1802, and 1790.\n In answer to the reasons which influence us to the conclusion already indicated, counsel for the respondent say, first, that the hypothesis that the foreign-born fathers and sons may all live abroad from birth to middle age and \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 669]\n\u00a0\n bring up families without any association with the United States, and that the sons may then become citizens by the ultimate residence of their fathers in the United States, is not a possible one, because such children must have signified their intention to become citizens when they reached eighteen years of age or at majority at any rate. But these provisions with respect to election of citizenship by those coming to majority were not in the statute when the proviso was enacted, and we must construe it as of 1790 with reference to the views that Congress may be thought to have have at that time.\n Then it is urged that the State Department has held that section 1993 refers only to children and not to adults. This would be a narrow construction of the proviso as it was intended to operate in 1790 when the act was passed, and, although this was suggested as a possible view by Secretary of State Bayard, it would limit too much the meaning of the word 'children' at a time when no provision had been made by law for election of citizenship by those coming of age. Nor does it seem to be in accord with Attorney General Gregory's opinion already referred to. 30 Op. Attys. Gen. 529.\n It is said that it would be illogical and unnatural to provide that the father, having begotten children abroad before he lived in the United States at all, and then having gone to the United States and resided there and returned and had more children abroad, should have a family part aliens and part citizens. As this is entirely within the choice of the father, there would seem to be no reason why such a situation should be anomalous. As the father may exercise his option in accordance with the law, as citizenship will follow that option.\n Counsel for the respondent in their learned and thorough brief have sought to sustain their conclusion in favor of the latitudinarian view of the proviso by many references, all of which we have examined. They point \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 670]\n\u00a0\n to the language of Mr. Justice Gray in delivering the majority opinion in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649\n, 18 S. Ct. 456. The majority in that case, as already said, held that the fundamental principle of the common law with regard to nationality was birth within the allegiance of the government and that one born in the United States, although of a race and of a parentage denied naturalization under the law, was nevertheless, under the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, a citizen of the United States by virtue of the jus soli embodied in the amendment. The attitude of Chief Justice Fulley and Mr. Justice Harlan was that at common law the children of our citizens born abroad were always natural-born citizens from the standpoint of this government, and that to that extent the jus sanguinis obtained here; that the Fourteenth Amendment did not exclude from citizenship by birth children born in the United States of parents permanently located here who might themselves become citizens; nor on the other hand did it arbitrarily make citizens of children born in the United States of adults who, according to the will of their native government and of this government, are and must remain aliens. Section 1993 is referred to both in the majority opinion and in the minority opinion. Speaking of the Act of 1855, the majority opinion says ( page 674 (18 S. Ct. 466)):\n'It thus clearly appears that, during the half century intervening between 1802 and 1855, there was no legislation whatever for the citizenship of children born abroad, during that period, of American parents who had not become citizens of the United States before the Act of 1802; and that the Act of 1855, like every other act of Congress upon the subject, has, by express proviso, restricted the right of citizenship, thereby conferred upon foreign-born children of American citizens, to those children themselves, unless they became residents of the United States. Here is nothing to countenance the the- \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 671]\n\u00a0\n ory that a general rule of citizenship by blood or descent has displaced in this country the fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within its sovereignty.'\n\n The minority opinion said (page 714 (18 S. Ct. 482)):\n'Section 1993 of the Revised Statutes provides that children so born 'are declared to be citizens of the United States; but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to children whose fathers never resided in the United States.' Thus a limitation is prescribed on the passage of citizenship by descent beyond the second generation if then surrendered by permanent non-residence, and this limitation was contained in all the acts from 1790 down.'\n\n It is very clear that the exact meaning of the proviso upon the point here at issue was not before the court. The section itself and the policy of the United States in the sections that preceded it were important in the discussion only in showing how restricted or otherwise was the application of the jus sanguinis in our law. There is nothing in the opinion of the ocurt that contains an intimation as to what period is covered by the expression, 'never resided in the United States.' We cannot regard such a doubtful expression as that of Chief Justice Fuller in his dissent as authoritative in respect to the issue here.\n Reference is then made to the very admirable opinion presented by Secretary Fish to President Grant, on July 27, 1868, of the legislation afterwards embodied in the Revised Statutes,  1999, 2000, and 2001 (Comp. St.  3955-3957), in reference to the right of expatriation prompted by the Fenian and other international differences and intended to apply especially to the expatriation of persons coming from European countries to the United States and seeking and receiving naturalization in the United States. U. S. Foreign Relations, 1873, pt. II, pp. 1191, 1192. President Grant solicited opinions from all of his Cabinet officers. That of Secretary Fish is relied on in this discussion. We do not find it specifically directed to the issue here. It \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 672]\n\u00a0\n is rather occupied in a consideration of the point which was then very much mooted, as to what constituted expatriation and what rules should be adopted in determining whether citizens or subjects of other countries coming to the United States were expatriated, and whether, after having been admitted to citizenship, they lost their rights of citizenship by reason of a return to the country of their birth and a residence there. The only important reference to the proviso of section 1993 is the suggestion by Secretary Fish that the proviso was a recognition by Congress of the right of foreign countries to fix for themselves what constituted allegiance to their country of persons living in their country, without regard to the laws of this country extending citizenship of this country to such persons within their allegiance. Nor do we find anything more definite upon the meaning of the proviso in section 1993 in the letter, already cited, of Secretary Fish to Mr. Washburn under date of June 28, 1873. Foreign Relations of the United States, 1873, pt. I, p. 256. Reference is also made to the opinion of Attorney General Hoar, already cited, which was rendered to Secretary Fish in a case that did not present this question at all. 13 Op. Attys. Gen. 90. The Secretary asked the Attorney General whether four persons residing in the Island of Curacao, for whom application was made for passports, were citizens of the United States and entitled as such to have passports issued to them. They were over twenty-one years of age, and were born in the islands of Curacao. Four of them were children of native citizens of the United States domiciled at Curacao who had not resided in the United States since 1841 ( the opinion was given in 1869), and it did not appear affirmatively that any of the applicants had resided or intended to reside in the United States, or that more than one of them had ever been in the country. The At- \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 673]\n\u00a0\n torney General expressed the opinion that, if the fathers of the applicants at the time of their birth were citizens of the United States and had 'at some time' resided within the United States, the applicants were citizens of the United States under the provisions of the statute and entitled to the privileges of citizenship. As their fathers were native- born citizens of the United States, the applicants were probably citizens under section 1993, whether their fathers at any time resided in the United States or not after the time of their birth. The point in the opinion by the Attorney General relied on by respondent's counsel is the intimation that these fathers should have 'at some time' resided in the United States, without restricting that residence to the time before their birth. The conclusion was that, as these applicants had never been in the United States, there was no obligation to give them passports, even though they were citizens of the United States. We can hardly regard that as a decision upon the point we are considering.\n In a work by Mr. Borchard, formerly Assistant Counsellor of the State Department, we find this:\n'To confer citizenship upon a child born abroad, the father must have resided in the United States. This limitation upon the right of transmitting citizenship indefinitely was intended to prevent the residence abroad of successive generations of persons claiming the privileges of American citizenship while evading its duties. It seems not to have been judicially determined whether the residence of the father in the United States must necessarily have preceded the birth of the child, but, by the fact that the statute provides that citizenship shall not 'descend,' it is believed that the residence prescribed must have preceded the birth of the child, and such has been the construction of the Department.' Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad, p. 609. \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 674]\n\u00a0\n In his notes under this passage, Mr. Borchard correctly points out that, while the case of State v. Adams, 45 Iowa, 99, 24 Am. Rep. 760, cited for the respondent herein, may have presented facts involving the point we are considering, it was not considered or discussed by the court.\n\n Mr. Borchard also refers to special consular instructions of the State Department, No. 340, July 27, 1914, entitled 'Citizenship of Children Born of American Fathers Who Have Never Resided in the United States.' These were instructions issued by Mr. Bryan when Secretary of State, ruling on the question whether residence by the father in Jerusalem, where the United States exercised by treaty extraterritorial powers, was residence within the United States satisfying the requirement of section 1993, and it was held not to be so, reversing former rulings. In these instructions Mr. Bryan indicated his view that foreign-born persons claiming citizenship under section 1993 must fail, if their fathers, citizens of the United States, had never resided in the United States when such persons were born, although this was not necessary to the decision he was making.\n Mr. Bryan's instructions were based on an opinion of Mr. Cone Johnson, Solicitor of the State Department, printed at pages 41 and 42 of a compilation concerning citizenship, issued by the Department in 1925, in which Mr. Johnson suggested that section 1993 might be construed to mean 'all children heretofore or hereafter born out of the limits or jurisdiction of the United States whose fathers, having resided in the United States were or may be at the time of their birth citizens thereof, are declared to be citizens of the United States.'\n Mr. Borchard's statement in his text that the construction of the Department has since been that the residence of the father must have preceded the birth of the child whose American citizenship is claimed rests on his personal experience and knowledge as an official of the Department and not on any subsequent printed pub- \n\n[274 U.S. 657, 675]\n\u00a0\n lication of the Department, to which we have been referred.\n It would seem then that the question before us is one that has really not been authoritatively decided except by two Circuit Courts of Appeals- that of the Ninth Circuit, which is here under review, and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Johnson v. Sullivan, 8 F.( 2d) 988), which adopted the view of the Ninth Circuit Court and followed it.\n The opinion in the Ninth Circuit says (page 369):\n'The statute refers to the descent of the rights of citizenship. The term 'descend' has a well-defined meaning in law. As defined by Webster, it means: 'To pass down, as from generation to generation, or from ancestor to heir.' If the term 'descend' is given that meaning in this connection, the status of the appellee would not become definitely fixed until his father became a resident of the United States or died without becoming such. In this former event he would become vested with all the rights of citizenship as soon as his father became a resident, while in the latter event his claim to citizenship would be forever lost.'\n\n The expression, 'the rights of citizenship shall descend,' cannot refer to the time of the death of the father, because that is hardly the time when they do descend. The phrase is borrowed from the law of property. The descent of property comes only after the death of the ancestor. The transmission of right of citizenship is not at the death of the ancestor but at the birth of the child, and it seems to us more natural to infer that the conditions of the descent contained in the limiting proviso, so far as the father is concerned, must be perfected and have been performed at that time.\n This leads to a reversal of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and a remanding of the respondent. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTFALL v. UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 766\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[274 U.S. 256, 257]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. S. Face and Harry D. Jewell, both of Grand Rapids, Mich., for Westfall.\n Mr. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Westfall was convicted under two indictments, the first of which charged him with aiding and procuring the branch manager of a State bank which was a member of the Federal Reserve System to misapply the funds of the bank. The second indictment charged a conspiracy to misapply the funds of the bank between the same and other parties. Both were based upon the issuing a fraudulent certificate of deposit for ten thousand dollars and the paying the same from the funds of the bank. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit certifies this \n\n[274 U.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n question:\n'Is the provision of section 9, chapter 6, of the Federal Reserve Act of December 23, 1913 (38 Stat. 259, 260), as amended June 21, 1917 ( chapter 32,  3; 40 Stat. 232), and July 1, 1922, constitutional in so far as it provides that 'such banks and the officers, agents and employees thereof shall also be subject to the provisions of and the penalties prescribed by section 5209 of the Revised Statutes?\"\n\n The amendment of July 1, 1922, referred to, is, we presume, chapter 274, 42 Stat. 821 (Comp. St.  9792). It has no immediate bearing upon the question propounded and as it is not relied upon in argument we shall leave it on one side.\n It is not disputed that Rev. Stat.  5209 (Comp. St.  9772), if applicable, punishes the bank manager, and those who aided and abetted him in his crime. Coffin v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 432, 447\n, 15 S. Ct. 394. The argument is that Congress has no power to punish offenses against the property rights of State banks. It is said that the state is so broad that it covers such offenses when they could not result in any loss to the Federal Reserve Banks, and it is suggested that if upheld the Act will invalidate similar statutes of the States. This argument is well answered by Hiatt v. United States (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 374, 377, certiorari denied \n268 \nU.S. 704\n, 45 S. Ct. 638. Of course an act may be criminal under the laws of both jurisdictions. United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 43 S. Ct. 141. And if a State bank chooses to come into the System created by the United States, the United States may punish acts injurious to the System, although done to a corporation that the State also is entitled to protect. The general proposition is too plain to need more than statement. That there is such a System and that the Reserve Banks are interested in the solvency and financial condition of the members also is too obvious to require a repetition of the careful analysis presented by the Solicitor General. The only suggestion that may deserve a word is that the statute applies indifferently \n\n[274 U.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n whether there is a loss to the Reserve Banks or not. But every fraud like the one before us weakens the member bank and therefore weakens the System. Moreover, when it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so. It may punish the forgery and utterance of spurious interstate bills of lading in order to protect the genuine commerce. United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S. Ct. 445. See further Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 32 S. Ct. 2. That principle is settled.

A certified copy of that order, brought here as an addition to the record, shows that it was made and entered pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, approved by the court, and that it contains the following statement:\n'The question whether the California Criminal Syndicalism Act ... and its application in this case is repugnant to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, providing that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, and that all persons shall be accorded the equal protection of the laws, was considered and passed upon by this Court.'\n\n In Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, \n200 \nU.S. 179, 182\n, 26 S. Ct. 208, where it appeared that a Federal question had been presented in a petition in error to the State Supreme Court in a case in which the judgment was affirmed without opinion, it was held that the certificate of that court to the effect that it had considered and necessarily decided this question, was sufficient to show its existence. And see Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 26 S. Ct. 31 et seq.; Consolidated Turnpike v. Norfolk, etc., Railway, \n228 \nU.S. 596, 599\n, 33 S. Ct. 605.\n So-while the unusual course here taken to show that Federal questions were raised and decided below is not to be commended-we shall give effect to the order of the Court of Appeal as would be done if the statement had been made in the opinion of that court when delivered.

The order dismissing the writ for want of jurisdiction will accordingly be set aside.\n We proceed to the determination, upon the merits, of the constitutional question considered and passed upon by the Court of Appeal. Of course our review is to be confined to that question, since it does not appear, either from the order of the Court of Appeal or from the record otherwise, that any other Federal question was presented in and either expressly or necessarily decided by that court.

And this necessarily excludes from our con- \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n sideration a question sought to be raised for the first time by the assignments of error here-not presented in or passed upon by the Court of Appeal-whether apart from the constitutionality of the Syndicalism Act, the judgment of the Superior Court, by reason of the rulings of that court on questions of pleading, evidence and the like, operated as a denial to the defendant of due process of law. See Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County, \n166 \nU.S. 648, 660\n, 17 S. Ct. 709, 41 L. Ed, 1149; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, supra, 248 (22 S. Ct. 120); Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v.

Ct. 82.\n The following facts, among many others, were established on the trial by undisputed evidence: The defendant, a resident of Oakland, in Alameda County, California, had been a member of the Local Oakland branch of the Socialist Party. This Local sent delegates to the national convention of the Socialist Party held in Chicago in 1919, which resulted in a split between the 'radical' group and the old-wing Socialists. The 'radicals'-to whom the Oakland delegates adhered-being ejected, went to another hall, and formed the Communist Labor Party of America. Its Constitution provided for the membership of persons subscribing to the principles of the Party and pledging themselves to be guided by its Platform, and for the formation of state organizations conforming to its Platform as the supreme declaration of the Party. In its 'Platform and Program' the Party declared that it was in full harmony with 'the revolutionary working class parties of all countries' and adhered to the principles of Communism laid down in the Manifesto of the Third International at Moscow, and that its purpose was 'to create a unified revolutionary working class movement in America,' organizing the workers as a class, in a revolutionary class struggle to conquer the capitalist state, for the overthrow of capitalist rule, the conquest of political power and the establishment \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n of a working class government, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, in place of the state machinery of the capitalists, which should make and enforce the laws, reorganize society on the basis of Communism and bring about the Communist Commonwealth; advocated, as the most important means of capturing state power, the action of the masses, proceeding from the shops and factories, the use of the political machinery of the capitalist state being only secondary; the organization of the workers into 'revolutionary industrial unions'; propaganda pointing out their revolutionary nature and possibilities; and great industrial battles showing the value of the strike as a political weapon; commended the propagenda and example of the Industrial Workers of the World and their struggles and sacrifices in the class war; pledged support and co- operation to 'the revolutionary industrial proletariat of America' in their struggles against the capitalist class; cited the Seattle and Winnipeg strikes and the numerous strikes all over the country 'proceeding without the authority of the old reactionary Trade Union officials,' as manifestations of the new tendency; and recommended that strikes of national importance be supported and given a political character, and that propagandists and organizers be mobilized 'who can not only teach, but actually help to put in practice the principles of revolutionary industrial unionism and Communism.'\n Shortly thereafter the Local Oakland withdrew from the Socialist Party, and sent accredited delegates, including the defendant, to a convention held in Oakland in November. 1919, for the purpose of organizing a California branch of the Communist Labor Party. The defendant, after taking out a temporary membership in the Communist Labor Party, attended this convention as a delegate and took an active part in its proceedings. She was elected a member of the Credentials Committee, and, as its chairman, made a report to the convention upon \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n which the delegates were seated. She was also appointed a member of the Resolutions Committee, and as such signed the following resolution in reference to political action, among others proposed by the Committee:\n'The C. L. P. of California fully recognizes the value of political action as a means of spreading communist propaganda; it insists that in proportion to the development of the economic strength of the working class, it, the working class, must also develop its political power. the C. L. P. of California proclaims and insists that the capture of political power, locally or nationally by the revolutionary working class can be of tremendous assistance to the workers in their struggle of emancipation. Therefore, we again urge the workers who are possessed of the right of franchise to cast their votes for the party which represents their immediate and final interest-the C. L. P.-at all elections, being fully convinced of the utter futility of obtaining any real measure of justice or freedom under officials elected by parties owned and controlled by the capitalist class.'\n\n The minutes show that this resolution, with the others proposed by the committee, was read by its chairman to the convention before the Committee on the Constitution had submitted its report. According to the recollection of the defendant, however, she herself read this resolution. Thereafter, before the report of the Committee on the Constitution had been acted upon, the defendant was elected an alternate member of the State Executive Committee. The Constitution, as finally read, was then adopted. This provided that the organization should be named the Communist Labor Party of California; that it should be 'affiliated with' the Communist Labor Party of America, and subscribe to its Program, Platform and Constitution, and 'through this affiliation' be 'joined with the Communist International of Moscow'; and that the qualifications for membership should be those prescribed in the \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n National Constitution. The proposed resolutions were later taken up and all adopted, except that on political action, which caused a lengthy debate, resulting in its defeat and the acceptance of the National Program in its place. After this action, the defendant, without, so far as appears, making any protest, remained in the convention until it adjourned. She later attended as an alternate member one or two meetings of the State Executive Committee in San Jose and San Francisco, and stated, on the trial, that she was then a member of the Communist Labor Party. She also testified that it was not her intention that the Communist Labor Party of California should be an instrument of terrorism or violence, and that it was not her purpose or that of the Convention to violate any known law.\n In the light of this preliminary statement, we now take up, in so far as they require specific consideration, the various grounds upon which it is here contended that the Syndicalism Act and its application in this case is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 1. \nWhile it is not denied that the evidence warranted the jury in finding that the defendant became a member of and assisted in organizing the Communist Labor Party of California, and that this was organized to advocate, teach, aid or abet criminal syndicalism as defined by the Act, it is urged that the Act, as here construed and applied, deprived the defendant of her liberty without due process of law in that it has made her action in attending the Oakland convention unlawful by reason of 'a subsequent event brought about against her will, by the agency of others,' with no showing of a specific intent on her part to join in the forbidden purpose of the association, and merely because, by reason of a lack of 'prophetic' understanding, she failed to foresee the quality that others would give to the convention. The argu- \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 367]\n\u00a0\n ment is, in effect, that the character of the state organization could not be forecast when she attended the convention; that she had no purpose of helping to create an instrument of terrorism and violence; that she 'took part in formulating and presenting to the convention a resolution which, if adopted, would have committed the new organization to a legitimate policy of political reform by the use of the ballot'; that it was not until after the majority of the convention turned out to be 'contrary minded, and other less temperate policies prevailed' that the convention could have taken on the character of criminal syndicalism; and that as this was done over her protest, her mere presence in the convention, however, violent the opinions expressed therein, could not thereby become a crime. This contention, while advanced in the form of a constitutional objection to the Act, is in effect nothing more than an effort to review the weight of the evidence for the purpose of showing that the defendant did not join and assist in organizing the Communist Labor Party of California with a knowledge of its unlawful character and purpose. This question, which is foreclosed by the verdict of the jury-sustained by the Court of Appeal over the specific objection that it was not supported by the evidence-is one of fact merely which is not open to review in this Court, involving as it does no constitutional question whatever. And we may add that the argument entirely disregards the facts that the defendant had previously taken out a membership card in the National Party; that the resolution which she supported did not advocate the use of the ballot to the exclusion of violent and unlawful means of bringing about the desired changes in industrial and political conditions; and that, after the constitution of the California Party had been adopted, and this resolution had been voted down and the National Program accepted, she not only remained in the convention, without \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 368]\n\u00a0\n protest, until its close, but subsequently manifested her acquiescence by attending as an alternate member of the State Executive Committee and continuing as a member of the Communist Labor Party.\n\n 2. \nIt is clear that the Syndicalism Act is not repugnant to the due process clause by reason of vagueness and uncertainty of definition. It has no substantial resemblance to the statutes held void for uncertainty under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments in International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 34 S. Ct. 853, 58 L. Ed, 1284; and United States v. Cohen Grocery, \n255 \nU.S. 81, 89\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045, because not fixing an ascertainable standard of guilt. The language of section 2, subd. 4, of the Act under which the plaintiff in error was convicted is clear; the definition of 'criminal syndicalism' specific.\n The Act, plainly, meets the essential requirement of due process that a penal statute be 'sufficiently explicit to inform those who subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalities,' and be couched in terms that are not 'so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.' Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 46 S. Ct. 126. And see United States v. Brewer, \n139 \nU.S. 278, 288\n, 11 S. Ct. 538; Chicago, etc., Railway v. Dey (C. C.) 35 F. 866, 876, 1 L. R. A. 744; Tozer v. United States (C. C.) 52 F. 917, 919. In Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 323, in which it was held that a criminal statute prohibiting the grazing of sheep on any 'range' previously occupied by cattle 'in the usual and customary use' thereof, was not void for indefiniteness because it failed to provide for the ascertainment of the boundaries of a 'range' or to determine the length of time necessary to constitute a prior occupation a 'usual' one, this Court siad:\n'Men familiar with range conditions and desirous of observing the law will have little difficulty \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 369]\n\u00a0\n in determining what is prohibited by it. Similar expressions are common in the criminal statutes of other States. This statute presents no greater uncertainty or difficulty, in application to necessarily varying facts, than has been repeatedly sanctioned by this court. Nash v. United States, \n229 U.S. 373\n, 377 (33 S. Ct. 780); Miller v. Strahl, \n239 U.S. 426\n, 434 (36 S. Ct. 147).'\n\n So, as applied here, the Syndicalism Act required of the defendant no 'prophetic' understanding of its meaning.\n And similar Criminal Syndicalism statutes of other States, some less specific in their definitions, have been held by the State courts not to be void for indefiniteness. State v. Hennessy, 114 Wash. 351, 364, 195 P. 211; State v. Laundy, 103 Or. 443, 460, 204 P. 958 206 P. 290; People v. Ruthenberg, 229 Mich. 315, 325, 210 N. W. 358. And see Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273, 277\n, 35 S. Ct. 383; People v. Steelik, 187 Cal. 361, 372, 203 P. 78; People v. Lloyd, 304 Ill. 23, 34, 136 N. E. 505.\n\n 3. \nNeither is the Syndicalism Act repugnant to the equal protection clause, on the ground that as its penalties are confined to those who advocate a resort to violent and unlawful methods as a means of changing industrial and political conditions, it arbitrarily discriminates between such persons and those who may advocate a resort to these methods as a means of maintaing such conditions.\n It is settled by repeated decisions of this Court that the equal protection clause does not take from a State the power to classify in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion, and avoids what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis and therefore is purely arbitrary; and that one who assails the classification must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 62, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160, and cases cited. \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 370]\n\u00a0\n A statute does not violate the equal protection clause merely because it is not all-embracing. Zucht v. King, \n260 \nU.S. 174, 177\n, 43 S. Ct. 24; James-Dickinson Farm Mortgage Co. v. Harry (Jan. 10, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 119\n, 47 S. Ct. 308. A state may properly direct its legislation against what it deems an existing evil without covering the whole field of possible abuses. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Ct. 281; Farmers' Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n262 \nU.S. 649, 661\n, 43 S. Ct. 651, 30 A. L. R. 635; James- Dickinson Mortgage Co. v. Harry, supra. The statute must be presumed to be aimed at an evil where experience shows it to be most felt, and to be deemed by the Legislature coextensive with the practical need; and is not to be overthrown merely because other instances may be suggested to which also it might have been applied; that being a matter for the Legislature to determine unless the case is very clear. Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 34 S. Ct. 856. And it is not open to objection unless the classification is so lacking in any adequate or reasonable basis as to preclude the assumption that it was made in the exercise of the legislative judgment and discretion. Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454; Graves v. Minnesota (Nov. 22, 1926) \n272 \nU.S. 425\n, 47 S. Ct. 122; Swiss Oil Corporation v. Shanks (Feb. 21, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 407\n, 47 S. Ct. 393.\n The Syndicalism Act is not class legislation; it affects all alike, no matter what their business associations or callings, who come within its terms and do the things prohibited. See State v. Hennessy, supra, 361 ( 195 P. 211); State v. Laundy, supra, 460 (204 P. 958). And there is no substantial basis for the contention that the Legislature has arbitrarily or unreasonably limited its application to those advocating the use of violent and unlawful methods to effect changes in industrial and political conditions; there being nothing indicating any ground to apprehend that those desiring to maintain existing industrial and political conditions did or would advocate such methods. That there is a wide-spread conviction of the necessity for legislation of \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 371]\n\u00a0\n this character is indicated by the adoption of similar statutes in several other States.\n\n 4. \nNor is the Syndicalism Act as applied in this case repugnant to the due process clause as a restraint of the rights of free speech, assembly, and association.\n That the freedom of speech which is secured by the Constitution does not confer an absolute right to speak, without responsibility, whatever one may choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license giving immunity for every possible use of language and preventing the punishment of those who abuse this freedom; and that a State in the exercise of its police power may punish those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to incite to crime, disturb the public peace, or endanger the foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow by unlawful means, is not open to question. Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 668 S., 45 S. Ct. 625, and cases cited.\n By enacting the provisions of the Syndicalism Act the State has declared, through its legislative body, that to knowingly be or become a member of or assist in organizing an association to advocate, teach or aid and abet the commission of crimes or unlawful acts of force, violence or terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political changes, involves such danger to the public peace and the security of the State, that these acts should be penalized in the exercise of its police power. That determination must be given great weight. Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute, Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 8 S. Ct. 273; and it may not be declared unconstitutional unless it is an arbitrary or unreasonable attempt to exercise the authority vested in the State in the public interest. Great Northern Railway v. Clara City, \n246 \nU.S. 434, 439\n, 38 S. Ct. 346.\n The essence of the offense denounced by the Act is the combining with others in an association for the ac- \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 372]\n\u00a0\n complishment of the desired ends through the advocacy and use of criminal and unlawful methods. It partakes of the nature of a criminal conspiracy. See People v. Steelik, supra, 376 (203 P. 78). That such united and joint action involves even greater danger to the public peace and security than the isolated utterances and acts of individuals is clear. We cannot hold that, as here applied, the Act is an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the police power of the State, unwarrantably infringing any right of free speech, assembly or association, or that those persons are protected from punishment by the due process clause who abuse such rights by joining and furthering an organization thus menacing the peace and welfare of the State.\n We find no repugnancy in the Syndicalism Act as applied in this case to either the due process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment on any of the grounds upon which its validity has been here challenged.\n The order dismissing the writ of error will be vacated and set aside, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring.)\n Miss Whitney was convicted of the felony of assisting in organizing, in the year 1919, the Communist Labor Party of California, of being a member of it, and of assembling with it. These acts are held to constitute a crime, because the party was formed to teach criminal syndicalism. The statute which made these acts a crime restricted the right of free speech and of assembly theretofore existing. The claim is that the statute, as applied, denied to Miss Whitney the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The felony which the statute created is a crime very unlike the old felony of conspiracy or the old misdemeanor \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 373]\n\u00a0\n of unlawful assembly. The mere act of assisting in forming a society for teaching syndicalism, of becoming a member of it, or assembling with others for that purpose is given the dynamic quality of crime. There is guilt although the society may not contemplate immediate promulgation of the doctrine. Thus the accused is to be punished, not for attempt, incitement or conspiracy, but for a step in preparation, which, if it threatens the public order at all, does so only remotely. The novelty in the prohibition introduced is that the statute aims, not at the practice of criminal syndicalism, nor even directly at the preaching of it, but at association with those who propose to preach it.\n Despite arguments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive, it is settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. Thus all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the federal Constitution from invasion by the states. The right of free speech, the right to teach and the right of assembly are, of course, fundamental rights. See Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A. L. R. 1446; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S. Ct. 571, 39 A. L. R. 468; Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 45 S. Ct. 625; Farrington v. Tokushige ( No. 465, decided February 21, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 284\n, 47 S. Ct. 406. These may not be denied or abridged. But, although the rights of free speech and assembly are fundamental, they are not in their nature absolute. Their exercise is subject to restriction, if the particular restriction proposed is required in order to protect the state from destruction or from serious injury, political, economic or moral. That the necessity which is essential to a valid restriction does not exist unless speech would produce, or is intended to produce, a clear and imminent danger of some substantive evil which the state constitutionally may seek to prevent has been settled. See Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Ct. 247. \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 374]\n\u00a0\n It is said to be the function of the Legislature to determine whether at a particular time and under the particular circumstances the formation of, or assembly with, a society organized to advocate criminal syndicalism constitutes a clear and present danger of substantive evil; and that by enacting the law here in question the Legislature of California determined that question in the affirmative. Compare Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 668\n, 671 S., 45 S. Ct. 625. The Legislature must obviously decide, in the first instance, whether a danger exists which calls for a particular protective measure. But where a statute is valid only in case certain condition exist, the enactment of the statute cannot alone establish the facts which are essential to its validity. Prohibitory legislation has repeatedly been held invalid, because unnecessary, where the denial of liberty involved was that of engaging in a particular business. \n2\n The powers of the courts to strike down an offending law are no less when the interests involved are not property rights, but the fundamental personal rights of free speech and assembly.\n This court has not yet fixed the standard by which to determine when a danger shall be deemed clear; how remote the danger may be and yet be deemed present; and what degree of evil shall be deemed sufficiently substantial to justify resort to abridgment of free speech and assembly as the means of protection. To reach sound conclusions on these matters, we must bear in mind why a state is, ordinarily, denied the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught with evil consequence. \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 375]\n\u00a0\n Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties, and that in its government the deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an end and as a means. They believed liberty to the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. \n3\n They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion, they eschewed silence \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 376]\n\u00a0\n coerced by law-the argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed.\n Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one. Every denunciation of existing law tends in some measure to increase the probability that there will be violation of it. \n4\n Condonation of a breach enhances the probability. Expressions of approval add to the probability. Propagation of the criminal state of mind by teaching syndicalism increases it. Advocacy of lawbreaking heightens it still further. But even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on. The wide difference between advocacy and incitement, between preparation and attempt, between assembling and conspiracy, must be borne in mind. In order to support a finding of clear and present danger it must be shown either that immediate serious violence was to be expected or was advocated, or that the past conduct furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated. \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 377]\n\u00a0\n Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not fear political change. They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty. To courageous, selfreliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government, no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present, unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion. If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. Only an emergency can justify repression. Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom. \n5\n Such, in my opinion, is the command of the Constitution. It is therefore always open to Americans to challenge a law abridging free speech and assembly by showing that there was no emergency justifying it.\n Moreover, even imminent danger cannot justify resort to prohibition of these functions essential to effective democracy, unless the evil apprehended is relatively serious. Prohibition of free speech and assembly is a measure so stringent that it would be inappropriate as the means for averting a relatively trivial harm to society. A police measure may be unconstitutional merely because the remedy, although effective as means of protection, is unduly harsh or oppressive. Thus, a state might, in the exercise of its police power, make any trespass upon the \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 378]\n\u00a0\n land of another a crime, regardless of the results or of the intent or purpose of the trespasser. It might, also, punish an attempt, a conspiracy, or an incitement to commit the trespass. But it is hardly conceivable that this court would hold constitutional a statute which punished as a felony the mere voluntary assembly with a society formed to teach that pedestrians had the moral right to cross uninclosed, unposted, waste lands and to advocate their doing so, even if there was imminent danger that advocacy would lead to a trespass. The fact that speech is likely to result in some violence or in destruction of property is not enough to justify its suppression. There must be the probability of serious injury to the State. Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not abridgment of the rights of free speech and assembly.\n The California Syndicalism Act recites in section 4:\n'Inasmuch as this act concerns and is necessary to the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety, for the reason that at the present time large numbers of persons are going from place to place in this state advocating, teaching, and practicing criminal syndicalism, this act shall take effect upon approval by the Governor.'\n\n This legislative declaration satisfies the requirement of the Constitution of the state concerning emergency legislation. In re McDermott, 180 Cal. 783, 183 P. 437. But it does not preclude inquiry into the question whether, at the time and under the circumstances, the conditions existed which are essential to validity under the federal Constitution. As a statute, even if not void on its face, may be challenged because invalid as applied (Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S. Ct. 106), the result of such an inquiry may depend upon the specific facts of the particular case. Whenever the fundamental rights of free speech and assembly are alleged to have been in- \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 379]\n\u00a0\n vaded, it must remain open to a defendant to present the issue whether there actually did exist at the time a clear danger, whether the danger, if any, was imminent, and whether the evil apprehended was one so substantial as to justify the stringent restriction interposed by the Legislature. The legislative declaration, like the fact that the statute was passed and was sustained by the highest court of the State, creates merely a rebuttable presumption that these conditions have been satisfied.\n Whether in 1919, when Miss Whitney did the things complained of, there was in California such clear and present danger of serious evil, might have been made the important issue in the case. She might have required that the issue be determined either by the court or the jury. She claimed below that the statute as applied to her violated the federal Constitution; but she did not claim that it was void because there was no clear and present danger of serious evil, nor did she request that the existence of these conditions of a valid measure thus restricting the rights of free speech and assembly be passed upon by the court of a jury. On the other hand, there was evidence on which the court or jury might have found that such danger existed. I am unable to assent to the suggestion in the opinion of the court that assembling with a political party, formed to advocate the desirability of a proletarian revolution by mass action at some date necessarily far in the future, is not a right within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the present case, however, there was other testimony which tended to establish the existence of a conspiracy, on the part of members of the International Workers of the World, to commit present serious crimes, and likewise to show that such a conspiracy would be furthered by the activity of the society of which Miss Whitney was a member. Under these circumstances the judgment of the State court cannot be disturbed. \n\n[274 U.S. 357, 380]\n\u00a0\n Our power of review in this case is limited not only to the question whether a right guaranteed by the federal Constitution was denied (Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590; Haire v. Rice, \n204 \nU.S. 291, 301\n, 27 S. Ct. 281), but to the particular claims duly made below, and denied (Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Duvall, \n225 \nU.S. 477, 485\n, 488 S., 32 S. Ct. 790). We lack here the power occasionally exercised on review of judgments of lower federal courts to correct in criminal cases vital errors, although the objection was not taken in the trial court. Wiborg v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 632, 658\n, 660 S., 16 S. Ct. 1127, 1197; Clyatt v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 207, 221\n, 222 S., 25 S. Ct. 429. This is a writ of error to a state court. Because we may not inquire into the errors now alleged I concur in affirming the judgment of the state court.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Statutes 1919, c. 58, p. 88. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare Frost v.

REINECKE(1927)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Forest D. Siefkin, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. Sewall Key, all of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by Jessie L. Wickwire, individually and as executrix of her husband, Edward L. Wickwire, to recover taxes from the United States collector of internal revenue for the First district of Illinois, on the ground that they were assessed against her and collected without legal authority. The tax was a so-called estate tax assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under section 402(c) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 c)), The section and paragraph provided:\n That 'the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, where-ever situated-\n'(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with \n\n[275 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act), except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title. ...'\n\n On December 22, 1919, the decedent, Edward L. Wickwire, transferred to his wife, the petitioner herein, cash and securities to the value of $ 362,028.48. He died April 21, 1920. The executrix did not include the value of the transferred property as part of the gross estate in her return for federal estate tax purposes. The commissioner of Internal Revenue claimed and, after the usual administrative hearings, determined that the transfer was made in contemplation of death, and assessed as a tax $18,021.41, which was paid. The declaration of the petitioner set up these facts and alleged that the transfer by her husband to her was not in contemplation of death. The case came on for trial, a jury was impaneled ans sworn, counsel for the executrix made his opening statement, called one witness and was examining him when the court interrupted the proceedings to raise on its own motion the point that the finding of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, unless impeached for fraud, bad faith, or mistaken legal theory, could not be reviewed by the court. Accordingly the attorney for the United States thereupon interposed a motion to dismiss. The petitioner then made certain offers of proof to establish the fact that the transfer was not in contemplation of death, \n\n[275 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n which was excluded by the court. The case was then dismissed.\n The tender of evidence was included in a bill of exceptions, and was, in general, that the deceased was 62 years old at the time of his death; that he had been suffering for 18 years from diabetes, but that his condition until early in 1920 was as good as, or better than, it had been for 10 years before that time; that his death was from uremic poisoning, the result of an attack of influenza suffered while he was in the South after the transfer; that he had long agreed with his wife that half of what he had belonged to her, but that their capital had been tied up so in business in his name that her half could not be given her until the business was reorganized and turned over to a stock company; that his doctor, a specialist in diabetes, assured him that, while his condition was that of a diabetic, he was not actually afficted with diabetes, though it might recur; that he had no reason to anticipate death in the near future when he made the transfer in December, 1919; that the transfer was in pursuance to a plan long made and not in anticipation of death.\n The action of the court below was based on the supposed authority of Park Falls Lumber Co. v. Burlingame, 1 F. (2d) 855, a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On a writ of error, the latter court held that the case cited was not in point, and that the lower court was not concluded by the finding of the Commissioner on the question of fact as to whether the transfer was in contemplation of death, and that the question was possibly a judicial one. But the court added: 'Notwithstanding this, the case, on the whole record, should be, and is, affirmed.' The explanation of this action, as suggested by the Solicitor General, is that, while the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trial court had \n\n[275 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n given a wrong reason for its action, its judgment should be affirmed because the opening statement of counsel for the petitioner, together with the evidence introduced by him and that offered by her, but rejected, showed conslusively as a matter of law that the transfer was in contemplation of death.\n It is quite clear that, as held by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the ruling of the trial court was erroneous, and that the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was not conclusive, but only furnished prima facie evidence of its correctness. United States v. Rindskopf, \n105 U.S. 418\n; Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Lucas (D. C.) 7 F.( 2d) 146. Upon the issue whether the transfer had been made in contemplation of death, the burden of proof was by the terms of the statute on the petitioner, as indeed it would have been without the special provision of the statute, because he was the plaintiff. We have not set forth in extenso the evidence which was offered, but it is very clear that there was enough to go to the jury to meet the burden against the petitioner on this main issue, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in holding otherwise. Indeed we do not understand the Solicitor General to contest this.\n It was suggested, in the brief for the United States in resisting the application for certiorari, that the assignment of error made on behalf of the petitioner was inadequate in that it was not based on a reference to the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution requiring a jury trial in a civil case involving more than $20. This objection has not been renewed in the brief on the merits, doubtless because the right of the petitioner to a jury in such a case is not to be found in the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, but merely arises by implication from the provisions of section 3226, Revised Statutes, (26 USCA  156 (Comp. St.  5949)), which has reference to a suit at law. It is within the undoubted power \n\n[275 U.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n of Congress to provide any reasonable system for the collection of taxes and the recovery of them when illegal, without a jury trial-if only the injunction against the taking of property without due process of law in the method of collection and protection of the taxpayer is satisfied.

MILTON DAIRY CO.(1927)\nNo. 156\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1927\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 215, 216]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Haydn S. Cole and Ira C. Oehler, both of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Dairy Company, a Minnesota corporation, brought this suit against the Collector to recover additional excess-profits taxes assessed against it under Title 3 of the Revenue Act of 19181 for its taxable years 1919 and 1920, 2 and paid under protest. Judgment for the Collector in the District Court, Milton Dairy Co. v. Willcuts, 8 F. (2d) 178, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 15 F. (2d) 814.\n The question here is whether profits earned by the Company that were insufficient to off-set an impairment of its paid-in capital, were 'undivided profits' to be included as 'invested capital' in computing the excess-profits credits allowed by the Act.\n Section 312 of the Act (Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 f) provided that the 'excess-profits credit' of a domestic corporation should 'consist of a specific exemption of $3,000 plus an amount equal to 8 per centum of the invested capital for the taxable year.' Section 326(a), being Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 i, defined the term 'invested capital,' with certain exceptions not now material, as the actual cash \n\n[275 U.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n and cash value of other property bona fide paid in for stock or shares, at the time of such payment, and '(3) Paid-in or earned surplus and undivided profits; not including surplus and undivided profits earned during the year.' Article 838 of Treasury Regulations 453 declared that:\n'Only true earned surplus and undivided profits can be included in the computation of invested capital. ... In the computation ... full recognition must first be given to all expenses incurred and losses sustained from the original organization of the corporation down to the taxable year. ... There can of course be no earned surplus or undivided profits until any deficit or impairment of paid- in capital due to depletion, depreciation, expense, losses or any other cause has been made good.'\n\n The Company was organized with a paid-in capital of $145,817.04. At the end of 19174 an operating deficit of $70,296.12, shown on the books, impaired the capital to that extent. In 1918 the Company had a net income of $11,489.26; and in 1919 a net income of $22,908.14. These earned profits were not distributed, and $29,853.03 thereof remained in the business at the end of 1919, without having been applied to reduce the impairment of the capital.\n In the returns on which the excess-profits taxes were originally assessed and paid, the Company, treating these earnings as 'undivided profits' constituting part of its 'invested capital,' reported as invested capital for 1919 the sum of the paid-in capital, $145,817.04, and the profits, $11,489.26, earned in 1918; and as invested capital for 1920 the sum of the paid-in capital and the $29,853.03 of profits earned in 1918 and 1919 and remaining in the business. \n\n[275 U.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter, on an audit of the returns, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, while allowing for each year as 'invested capital' the amount of the paid-in capital, excluded from the computation of the 'invested capital' the amounts claimed as 'undivided profits,' on the ground that they did not constitute true 'undivided profits' but should be applied to reduce the impairment of the capital. And on the basis of such exclusions he assessed the additional taxes.\n We think that clause (3) relating to 'surplus and undivided profits' was correctly interpreted by Article 838 of the Treasury Regulations. Both these terms as commonly employed in corporate accounting denote an excess in the aggregate value of all the assets of a corporation over the sum of all its liabilities, including capital stock. See Edwards v. Douglas, \n269 \nU.S. 204, 214\n, 46 S. Ct. 85; Insurance Co. of North America v. McCoach (D. C.) 218 F. 905, 908. Aside from the fact that a surplus may not only be 'earned,' as where it is derived from undistributed profits, but 'paid-in,' as where the stock is issued at a price above par, the distinction between these terms, as commonly employed, is that the term 'surplus' describes such part of the excess in the value of the corporate assets as is treated by the corporation as part of its permanent capital, usually carried on the books in a separate 'surplus account;' while the term 'undivided profits' designates such part of the excess as consists of profits 'which have neither been distributed as dividends nor carried to surplus account.' Edwards v. Douglas, supra, 214 ( 46 S. Ct. 89). But it is a prerequisite to the existence of 'undivided profits' as well as a 'surplus,' that the net assets of the corporation exceed the capital stock. Hence, where the capital is impaired, profits, though earned and remaining in the business, if insufficient to offset this impairment do not constitute 'undivided profits.' \n\n[275 U.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n We cannot doubt that this term was used in clause (3) with its ordinary meaning, nor agree with the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the arbitrary definition given by the Act to the term 'invested capital' not equivalent to that of the ordinary invested capital of commerce, indicates that the words 'surplus and undivided profits' were not used with their ordinary meaning as conditioned by an excess of assets. We do not think Congress intended that a corporation whose capital was impaired should be entitled to treat profits that, though earned, were insufficient to make good the impairment and create a surplus, as 'undivided profits.' This would not only give the term 'undivided profits' a meaning entirely at variance with ordinary usage-making it merely equivalent to any earned profits remaining in the business-but would grant the privilege of twice disregarding the impairment of capital, that is, once in computing the paid-in capital, which under the express terms of the Act was to be taken at the full cash or money value at the time of payment, and again in computing the 'undivided profits.' This term is entirely inapt to express such a purpose.\n This conclusion is in harmony with the general view expressed in LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 388\n, 41 S. Ct. 528. Dealing there in another aspect with the Revenue Act of 1917 ( tit. 2,  207 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/8 h)) which contained a similar clause concerning the inclusion of 'paid-in or earned surplus and undivided profits' as 'invested capital' in determining the amount of the excess- profits tax, this Court said, arguendo, that in order to avoid exaggerated valuation of invested capital 'the act resorted to the test of including nothing but money, or money's worth, actually contributed or converted in exchange for shares of the capital stock, or actually acquired through the business activities of the corporation ... and coming in ab extra, by \n\n[275 U.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n way of increase over the original capital stock,' and that the provision including 'paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits used or employed in the business' recognized 'that in some cases contributions are received from stockholders in money or its equivalent for the specific purpose of creating an actual excess capital over and above the par value of the stock.' And see Appeal of Valdosta Grocery Co., 2 B. T. A. 727, 729, and Appeal of Gould Copper Co., 5 B. T. A. 499, 517.\n The fact that under Title 2 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 a-6336 1\/8 z) providing for an income tax, a corporation, as was held in Long Beach Improvement Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 B. T. A. 590, was subject to a tax upon its net income despite an impairment of its capital, is not of moment. The deductions from gross income allowed by that Title do not refer to invested capital, surplus or undivided profits, and its provisions throw no light upon the meaning of those terms as used in Title 3 providing for an excess-profits tax.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed; and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 1057, 1088, c. 18 (Comp.

The purpose was to expedite the transfer of coal from cars to boats at certain Atlantic ports. August 23, 1917, the President, by virtue of the Lever Act, approved \n\n[275 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n August 10, 1917, 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/8 e et seq.), appointed a Fuel Administrator to carry out its provisions relating to fuel. The latter made an order that approved the rules of the exchange, designated its commissioner as his representative to carry out the order and rules, and required every shipper of coal for transshipment at such ports, on and after Nevember 11, 1917, to consign the coal to the exchange in accordance with and subject to its rules. The defendant, acting through the Fuel Administrator, represented and agreed that any and all coal shipped subject to the order should be credited to the shipper in accordance with the rules of the exchange. The order and rules required that all coal shipped to such ports should be pooled with other shipments of the same classification, and that each shipper should be credited in the pools with coal equivalent to the amounts theretofore shipped by him. Claimant, at various times between November 11, 1917, and December 5, 1918, shipped coal to the exchange. 'The defendant, acting through said United States Fuel Administrator, its duly authorized representative, withheld from and failed to credit' claimant for coal to which it was entitled, amounting in all to 34,143 net tons. Claimant was not given credit for these amounts until December 5, 1918. It was ready to receive the coal at the various times the credits should have been given; and there are allegations to show that, by reason of the facts above mentioned, claimant was damaged in the sum of $50,000.\n Claimant's narration strongly suggests that the failure to give it timely credits was due to some fault or negligence on the part of those operating the exchange. But, recognizing the rule that the government cannot be held for tort (Bigby v. United States, \n188 \nU.S. 400\n, 23 S. Ct. 468), it seeks \n\n[275 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n recovery on the ground that its property was taken for public use entitling it to compensation under the Fifth Amendment.\n No part of claimant's coal was consumed or appropriated by the government. Claimant asserts that its power to dispose of the coal was taken and withheld until it got credit therefor. But, if that be assumed, there is nothing to indicate that the taking was for public use. Moreover, if property was appropriated for public use, the taking must have been under section 10 of the Lever Act, being Comp. St.  3115 1\/8 ii (Bedding Co. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 491\n, 45 S. Ct. 182), and the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction, as that section gave the District Courts exclusive jurisdiction over controversies concerning compensation ( United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547\n, 41 S. Ct. 569; Houston Coal Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 361\n, 43 S. Ct. 612).\n Claimant contends that, even if there was no taking, the government is liable on a contract implied in fact. It was not the government's purpose to acquire any of claimant's property. The Fuel Administrator's order was made to expedite the movement of coal by subjecting it to the rules and operation of the exchange. And, as the credits were not withheld for any public purpose, the facts and circumstances alleged are clearly insufficient to imply an obligation on the part of the government to indemnify claimant against losses due to delays and decline of market price. Cf. Bothwell v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 231\n, 41 S. Ct. 74; Morrisdale Coal Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 188\n, 42 S. Ct. 481; Omnia Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502\n, 43 S.

UNITED STATES(1927)\nNo. 79\nArgued: November 24, 1926Decided: January 3, 1927\n\n\n\n Mr. Marshall B. Woodworth, of San Francisco Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[273 U.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error was indicted in the Federal District Court for Northern California under section 37 of the Criminal Code1 (Comp. St.  10201), for conspiring to commit offenses against the United States in violation of the Opium Act of 1909, as amended in 1914 and 1922.2 He was tried and convicted, and thereupon brought the case here by a direct writ of error under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), before the amendment made by the Jurisdictional Act of 1925 became effective, as one involving the application of the Constitution and in which the constitutionality of a law of the United States was drawn in question.\n The errors assigned and apecified here are that the Opium Act, as amended, is repugnant to the due process and self-incrimination clauses of the Fifth Amendment; that the indictment is invalid under the Sixth Amendment; and that the court erred in overruling a demurrer to the indictment, denying a motion for a bill of particulars and a motion in arrest of judgment, and in its charge to the jury.\n\n 1. \nThere was no challenge to the constitutionality of the Opium Act in the District Court. This question was not presented in that court and was neither considered nor determined by it. The objections to the constitutionality of the Act which were set out in the assignment of errors are fully answered in Yee Hem v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 178\n, 45 S. Ct. 470, decided after this writ of error had been \n\n[273 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n sued out; and the additional objections set forth for the first time in the brief for the defendant in this Court, do not require consideration here.\n\n 2. \nThe case is, however, otherwise brought here under the writ of error, by reason of a challenge which the defendant on the ground the validity of the indictment on the ground that it did not inform him of the 'nature and cause of the accusation' as required by the Sixth Amendment.\n The Opium Act, as amended, provides, in section 2(c), being Comp. St .  8801, that if any person 'receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale' of any narcotic drug 'after being imported' into the United States, 'knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law,' he shall upon conviction be fined or imprisoned. 42 Stat. 596.\n The indictment, which was returned in September, 1924, charged that on or about September 10, 1922, the exact date being to the grand jurors unknown, the defendant, being in the City and County of San Francisco, within the jurisdiction of the court, conspired to commit the acts made offenses by the Opium Act, as amended, that is to say, that at the time and place aforesaid, he knowingly and feloniously conspired and agreed with one Ben Drew and drivers other persons to the grand jurors unknown, to 'knowingly and feloniously receive, conceal, buy, sell and facilitate the transportation and concealment after importation of certain narcotic drugs, to-wit, smoking opium, the said defendant well knowing the said drugs to have been imported into the United States and into the jurisdiction of this Court contrary to law'; that this conspiracy continued throughout all the times after September, 1922, mentioned in the indictment and particularly at the time of the commission of each of the overt acts thereinafter set forth; and that in furtherance of this conspiracy and to effect its object, the defendant, \n\n[273 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n in the City and County of San Francisco received, bought, sold and facilitated the transportation after importation of three small sacks containing tins of opium which arrived on the Steamer President Pierce on or about February 24, 1923, without the knowledge and consent of the customs officers in charge of the port at San Franchisco, and also, to effect the same object, and in the same place, received, bought, etc., after importation other sacks containing tins of opium, which likewise arrived without the knowledge and consent of said customs officers, namely, five sacks which arrived on the Steamer Nanking on or about May 10, 1923, three sacks which arrived on the Steamer President Wilson on or about May 25, 1923, five sacks which arrived on the Steamer Taiyo Maru on or about May 27, 1923, five sacks which arrived on the Steamer President Taft on or about June 29, 1923, two sacks which arrived on the Steamer President Lincoln, on or about August 19, 1923, and one sack which arrived on the Steamer President Cleveland on or about February 3, 1924, the exact number of tins of opium in these several sacks and the exact dates of their arrival being unknown to the grand jurors.\n The defendant demurred to the indictment on the ground that its allegations as to the conspiracy and overt acts were so vague, indefinite and uncertain that they did not inform him of the nature and cause of the accusation as required by the Sixth Amendment, and enable him to make proper defense or plead his jeopardy in bar of a later prosecution for the same offense. This demurrer and a subsequent motion made in arrest of judgment on the same grounds, were both overruled by the District Court.\n While it is essential to the validity of an indictment under the Federal Constitution and laws that it shall advise the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation in order that he may meet it and prepare for \n\n[273 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n trial, and after judgment, be able to plead the record and judgment in bar of a further prosecution for the same offense, Bartell v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 427, 431\n, 33 S. Ct. 383, we find in the present indictment no lack of compliance with this requirement. It charged the defendant, with definiteness and certainty and reasonable particularity as to time and place, with conspiring with a named person and others to commit certain specified offenses in violation of the Opium Act; and further charged him, in like manner, with doing various specified acts to effect the object of the conspiracy. It is well settled that in an indictment for conspiring to commit an offense-in which the conspiracy is the gist of the crime-it is not necessary to allege with technical precision all the elements essential to the commission of the offense which is the object of the conspiracy, Williamson v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 425, 447\n, 28 S. Ct. 163, or to state such object with the detail which would be required in an indictment for committing the substantive offense, Thornton v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 414, 423\n, 46 S. Ct. 585; Jelke v. United States (C. C. A.) 255 F. 264, 275; Anderson v. United States (C. C. A.) 260 F. 557, 558; Wolf V. United States (C. C. A.) 283 F. 885, 886; Goldberg v. United States (C. C. A.) 277 F. 211, 213. In charging such a conspiracy 'certainty, to a common intent, sufficient to identify the offense which the defendants conspired to commit, is all that is' necessary. Williamson v. United States, supra, 447 (28 S. Ct. 171); Goldberg v. United States, supra, 213. That this requirement was complied with in the present indictment is clear. In Keck v. United States, \n172 \nU.S. 434\n, 19 S. Ct. 254, upon which the defendant relies, the indictment was not, as here, for conspiring to commit offenses, but for committing the substantive offenses. And in Hartson v. United States (C. C. A.) 14 F.(2d) 561, upon which he also relies, a count charging a single conspiracy to commit several offenses, was held sufficient, although another count charging in like manner the commission of one of these substantive offenses, \n\n[273 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n was held insufficient. In the present case we think that the allegations of the indictment, both in respect to the conspiracy and the overt acts, sufficiently advised the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation, and with the requisite particularity. We conclude that there was no invalidity in the indictment under the Sixth Amendment, and that both the demurrer and the motion in arrest of judgment were properly overruled.\n\n 3. \nThe defendant also made a motion, supported by affidavit, for a detailed bill of particulars, setting forth with particularity the specific facts in reference to the several overt acts alleged in the indictment, with various specifications as to times, places, names of persons, quantities, prices, containers, buildings, agencies, instrumentalities, etc., and the manner in which and the specific circumstances under which they were committed. This motion-which in effect sought a complete discovery of the Government's case in reference to the overt acts-was denied on the ground that the indictment was sufficiently definite in view of the unknown matters involved and the motion called 'for too much details of evidence.'\n The application for the bill of particulars was one addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and, there being no abuse of this discretion, its action thereon should not be disturbed. See Rosen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 29, 40\n, 16 S. Ct. 434, 480; Dunlop v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 486, 491\n, 17 S. Ct. 375; Knauer v. United States (C. C.

And there is nothing in the record indicating that the defendant was taken by surprise in the progress of the trial, or that his substantial rights were prejudiced in any way by the refusal to require the bill of particulars. See Connors v. United states, \n158 \nU.S. 408, 411\n, 15 S. Ct. 951; Armour Packing Co. \n\n[273 U.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 84\n, 28 S. Ct. 428; New York Central R. R. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 481, 497\n, 29 S. Ct. 304.\n\n 4. \nError is also assigned as to a statement made in the charge to the jury in respect to the defendant's knowledge that certain opium had been unlawfully imported; but it suffices to say that this was not excepted to.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This section provides that: 'If two or more persons conspire ... to commit any offense against the United States, ... and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to such conspiracy' shall be fined, or imprisoned, or both. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of February 9, 1909, c. 100, 35 Stat. 614, as amended by the Acts of January 17, 1914, c. 9, 38 Stat. 275, and May 26, 1922, c. 202, 42 Stat. 596 (Comp.

Stephens, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding in mandamus brought in the state court to compel defendants in error to issue a building permit enabling plaintiffs in error to erect a business \n\n[274 U.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n building upon a lot lying within a district of the city of Los Angeles restricted by the zoning ordinance of that city against buildings of that character. The ordinance creates five zones, designated as 'A.' 'B.' 'C.' 'D,' and 'E.' respectively, and classifies the kind of buildings, structures, and improvements which may be erected in each. The ordinance is of the now familiar comprehensive type, but in the main regulates only the character of buildings which lawfully may be erected, and does not prescribe height and area limitations. It is assailed as being repugnant to the due process of law and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The property of plaintiffs in error is in zone 'B,' in which, generally stated, the use is limited to buildings for residential purposes churches, private clubs, educational, and similar purposes. All buildings for private business are excluded, with the exception of offices of persons practicing medicine. The state Supreme Court, in a well-reasoned opinion, upheld the ordinance and denied the relief sought. 195 Cal. 497, 234 P. 388. And see Miller v. Board of Public Works, 195 Cal. 477, 234 P. 381, 38 A. L. R. 1479\n\n\n The constitutional validity of the ordinance in its general scope is settled by the recent decision of this court in Euclid v. Ambler Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365\n, 47 S. Ct. 114, and upon the record here we find no warrant for saying that the ordinance is unconstitutional constitutional as applied to the facts in the present case. The property of plaintiffs in error adjoins Wilshire avenue, a main artery of travel through and beyond the city, and if such property were available for business purposes its market value would be greatly enhanced. The lands within the district were, when the ordinance was adopted, sparsely occupied by buildings, those in which business was carried on being limited to a few real estate offices, a grocery store, a market, a fruit stand, and a two-story business block. Much of the land \n\n[274 U.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n adjoining the boulevard within the restricted district had already been sold with restrictions against buildings for business purposes, although the property of plaintiffs in error and the adjacent property had not been so restricted. The effect of the evidence is to show that the entire neighborhood, at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance, was largely unimproved, but in course of rapid development. The common council of the city, upon these and other facts, concluded that the public welfare would be promoted by constituting the area, including the property of plaintiffs in error, a zone 'B' district, and it is impossible for us to say that their conclusion in that respect was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. The most that can be said is that whether that determination was an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unequal exercise of power is fairly debatable. In such circumstances, the settled rule of this court is that it will not substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body charged with the primary duty and responsibility of determining the question.

Gen., of Washington, D. C., George R. Farnum, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Dean Hill Stanley, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Sutherland.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to reach and apply property in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, seized as property of the Wiener Bank-Verein, as allowed by the amendment of the Trading with the Enemy Act of June 5, 1920, c. 241; 41 Stat. 977 (Comp. St .  3115 1\/2 e). The appellants were the plaintiffs. Before the late war they were depositors in the Wiener Bank-Verein, and on April 6, 1917, had on deposit 2,063,799.03 kronen. \n\n[274 U.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n The war intervened and after the cessation of hostilities the plaintiffs demanded the amount of said kronen on deposit as of April 6, 1917, at the average call rate of exchange of the month preceding the outbreak of war between the United States and Austria-Hungary, viz., 11.18 United States cents for each Austrian krone. The General Civil Law of Austria,  1425, provided that if a debt could not be paid because of dissatisfaction with the offer or other important reasons the debtor might deposit in court the subject-matter in dispute, and that if legally carried out and if the creditor was informed, this measure should discharge the debtor and place the subject-matter delivered at the risk of the creditor. The creditor not being satisfied with what the Bank was willing to do, the Bank, on April 1, 1920, deposited the amount stated to be due in the proper court, with interest at 2 1\/2 per cent., and notified the plaintiffs. It relies upon the deposit as a defense, and the Circuit Court of Appeals held it to be one, 7 F.(2d) 443, overruling the decision of the District Court which allowed a recovery at the rate of exchange on August 12, 1919, on the ground that the plaintiffs showed that they wanted their money, although they made no adequate demand, on that day. Zimmerman v. Miller, 2 F. (2d) 629.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right, and in view of the recent case of Deutsche Bank Filiale Nurnberg v. Humphrey, \n272 \nU.S. 517\n, 47 S. Ct. 166, November 23, 1926, does not need extended reasoning. Here as there the debt was due and payable in the foreign country. The only primary obligation was that created by the law of Austria-Hungary and if by reason of an attachment of property or otherwise the courts of the United States also gave a remedy the only thing that they could do with justice was to enforce the obligation as it stood, not to substitute something else that seemed to them about fair. The distinction between the Deutsche Bank Case and Hicks v. Guin- \n\n[274 U.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n ness, \n269 \nU.S. 71\n, 46 S. Ct. 46, is not, as argued, that the plaintiff in Hicks v. Guinness was in the United States, but that, as the court understood the facts, the debt was payable in New York and subject to American law, so that upon a breach of the contract there arose a present liability in dollars. As the present debt was governed wholly by the law of Austria-Hungary on April 1, 1920, when the deposit was made, it was discharged by the deposit which was substituted as the only object of the creditor's claim. An elaborate argument is made that the original contract between the parties was dissolved by the war. Such considerations are immaterial when it is realized that in any view of all that had happened the only obligations of the Wiener Bank-Verein were those imposed by the law of Austria-Hungary, and that if that law discharged the debt the debt was discharged everywhere.\n The plaintiffs argue that they have rights under the Treaty of August 24, 1921, between the United States and Austria (42 Stat. 1946). But the short answer is that their rights against the Bank were ended before that treaty was made. They also urge that this is a suit under the Trading with the Enemy Act. But so was Deutsche Bank v. Humphrey. That act did not turn the Austrian into an American debt and impose a new and different obligation upon the Austrian Bank.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n"}}
