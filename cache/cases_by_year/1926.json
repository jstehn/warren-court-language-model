States Supreme Court\nALABAMA & v. RY. CO. V. JACKSON & E. RY. CO.(1926)\nNo. 244\nArgued: April 16, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Blanc Monroe, of New Orleans, La., Robert H. Thompson, of Jackson, Miss., Monte M. Lemann, of New Orleans, La., A. S. Bozeman, of Meridian, Miss., and S. L. McLaurin, of Brandon, Miss., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. George B. Neville, of Meridian, Miss., Marcellus Green, of Jackson, Miss., and Hardy R. Stone, of Meridian, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Alabama & Vicksburg Railway and the Jackson & Eastern Railway are both Mississippi corporations. Each owns and operates in intrastate and interstate commerce a railroad within that state. The latter instituted a proceeding under a state law to secure by eminent domain a connection with the former's line at a point east of the city of Jackson, called Curran's Crossing. Prior to instituting the eminent domain proceeding the Jackson & Eastern had secured from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate under paragraphs 18-20 of section 1, Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563), authorizing the extension of its road from Sebastopol, Miss., to Jackson. The order made no reference to Curran's Crossing, or to any connection with the Alabama & Vicksburg. Public Convenience Certificate of Jackson & Eastern Ry. Co., 70 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 110, 495. Thereafter, but also before instituting the eminent domain proceeding and before building the extension authorized, the Jackson & Eastern applied to the Commission for an order authorizing it to connect with the main line of the Alabama & Vicksburg at Curran's Crossing, and requiring the latter to grant a joint use of its main line from that point into the city of Jackson. This application, which had apparently been filed under paragraph 9 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, was withdrawn without a hearing. Compare United States v. Baltimore & O. S. W. R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 14\n, 33 S. Ct. 5. No further application was made to the Commission. \n\n[271 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n By the Constitution and statutes of Mississippi a railroad corporation organized under the laws of that state may 'cross, intersect, join, or unite its railroad with any other railroad heretofore or hereafter constructed at any points on their routes, and upon the ground of such other railroad company, with the necessary and proper turn-outs, sidings, switches, and other conveniences, and (may) exercise the right of eminent domain for that purpose.' Constitution of 1890,  184, 190; Hemingway's Code,  6722, 6725, 6728. This right of eminent domain is exercised by proceedings in a special court which has jurisdiction to determine only the amount of the damages payable. The special court cannot pass upon the right of a plaintiff to institute the proceeding or upon any defense or other objection. Nor can any such question be raised upon an appeal from the judgment of the special court. The sole remedy of the objecting railroad is a separate proceeding to be brought in a court of equity. Hemingway's Code,  1492; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 369, 378\n, 380 S., 34 S. Ct. 810; Vinegar Bend Lumber Co. v. Oak Grove & G. R. Co., 89 Miss. 84, 43 So. 292; Alabama & Vicksburg R. Co. v. Jackson & Eastern Ry. Co., 131 Miss. 857, 874, 95 So. 733.\n This suit was brought by the Alabama & Vicksburg in the appropriate chancery court of the state to enjoin the Jackson & Eastern from pursuing the eminent domain proceeding. The bill alleged willingness to permit a junction, but asserted that the point selected by the defendant was an improper one, would imperil the safety of life and property, would burden interstate commerce, and would be prejudicial to the plaintiff's interests. It asserted, among other grounds of relief, the claim that the Interstate Commerce Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the establishment of junctions or physical connections between railroads engaged in interstate commerce, that the Commission had not authorized the connection \n\n[271 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n here in question, and that the institution of eminent domain proceedings was therefore in violation of the federal law. A restraining order issued upon the filing of the bill. Later the chancellor sustained a demurrer to the bill for want of equity, dissolved the injunction, and denied supersedeas pending an appeal to the Supreme Court of the state. That court allowed a supersedeas (129 Miss. 437, 91 So. 902), overruled the demurrer, reversed the decree, and remanded the case for further proceedings. It did this on the ground that, while under the state law the connection might ordinarily be made at such point on the other's line as the railroad seeking the junction might desire, the place selected must be a proper one, and the bill alleged that the particular junction sought was not. 131 Miss. 857, 874, 95 So. 733. Upon that issue the chancellor then heard the case on the evidence, found that the proposed connection was a proper one, dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bill. That decree was affirmed upon a second appeal to the Supreme Court. 136 Miss. 726, 101 So. 553. In affirming the decree, the highest court of the state overruled the contention of the Alabama & Vicksburg that the Interstate Commerce Commission had exclusive jurisdiction over the establishment of junctions between railroads engaged in interstate commerce, held that Congress had not taken full control of the subject, and concluded that the authority granted by the state law to secure junctions did not interfere with interstate commerce to an appreciable degree, if at all. The case is here on writ of error with supersedeas granted by the Chief Justice of the state. A petition for writ of certiorari was also filed, consideration of which was postponed. As the case is properly here on writ of error, the petition is dismissed.\n In Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific R. R. v. Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287\n, 21 S. Ct. 115, decided in 1900, this court sustained an \n\n[271 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n order of a state commission which, at the instance of shippers, had directed two railroads of the state engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce to provide a physical connection between their lines. The state commission had found that the connection was required for intrastate commerce, and this court concluded that the connection ordered could not prejudice interstate commerce. Since then the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been greatly enlarged and the power of the states over interstate carriers correspondingly restricted. Prominent among the enlarged powers of the federal Commission is the control conferred over construction and equipment of railroads, over their use by other carriers and, generally, over the relation of carriers to one another. While none of the amendments in specific terms confer upon the Commission exclusive power over physical connections between railroads engaged in interstate commerce, it is clear that the comprehensive powers conferred extend to junctions between main lines like those here in question.\n The Act to Regulate Commerce of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, provided, by what is now paragraph 3 of section 3 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8565), that carriers shall 'afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines'; but it did not confer upon the Commission authority to permit and to require the construction of the physical connection needed to effectuate such interchange. Paragraph 9 of section 1, introduced by Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stat. 539, 547, required a carrier engaged in interstate commerce to construct a switch connection 'upon application of any lateral, branch line' and empowered the Commission to enforce the duty; but that provision was held applicable only to a line already constituting a lateral branch road. United States v. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R. Co., \n226 U.S. 14\n, 33, S. Ct. 5. The Act of August 24, 1912, c. 390,  11, 37 \n\n[271 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 560, 568, amending section 6 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (now Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8569), empowered the Commission to require railroads to establish physical connection between their lines and the docks of water carriers; but the provision did not extend to connections between two rail lines. It was not until Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, conferred upon the Commission additional authority, that it acquired full power over connections between interstate carriers. By paragraphs 18-20 added to section 1, it vested in the Commission power to authorize constructions or extensions of lines, although the railroad is located wholly within one state; and by paragraph 21 authorized the Commission to require the carrier 'to extend its line or lines.' By paragraph 4 of section 3 it empowered the Commission to require one such carrier to permit another to use its terminal facilities 'including main line track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of such terminal.'\n The only limitation set by Transportation Act of 1920, upon the broad powers conferred upon the Commission over the construction, extension and abandonment of the lines of carriers in interstate commerce, is that introduced as paragraph 22 of section 1, which excludes from its jurisdiction 'spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks, located ... wholly within one state, or of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.' It is clear that the connection here in question is not a track of this character. Compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. (No. 417, decided March 1, 1926) \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263. The proposed junction is between the main lines of the two railroads. The point of junction is on the main line of the Alabama & Vicksburg, near its entrance into the city of Jackson. In support of the objection that a junction there would be dangerous, it was shown that the connection would be located between two tres- \n\n[271 U.S. 244, 250]\n\u00a0\n tles, near a highway crossing, on a curve, on a fill, and within the flood area of Pearl river. The establishment of the junction at that point would, if the objection is well founded, obviously imperil interstate commerce. The fact that it may do so, shows that the jurisdiction of the Commission over such connections must be exclusive, if the duty imposed upon it to develop and control an adequate system of interstate rail transportation is to be effectively performed. Moreover, the establishment of junctions between the main lines of independent carriers is commonly connected with the establishment of through routes and the interchange of car services, and is often but a step toward the joint use of tracks. Over all of these matters the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction.\n It is true that in this case the state court found that the place selected for the junction was a proper one. But the power to make the determination whether state action will obstruct interstate commerce inheres in the United States as an incident of its power to regulate such commerce. Compare Colorado v. United States (No. 195, decided May 3, 1926) \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452. In matters relating to the construction, equipment, adaptation and use of interstate railroad lines, with the exceptions specifically set forth in paragraph 22, Congress has vested in the Commission the authority to find the facts and thereon to exercise the necessary judgment. The Commission's power under paragraph 3 of section 3 to require the establishment of connections between the main lines of carriers was asserted by it in Pittsburg & West Virginia Ry. Co. v. Lake Erie, Alliance & Wheeling R. R., 81 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 333, a case decided after the withdrawal by the Jackson & Eastern of its application to the Commission for leave to make the junction at Curran's Crossing, and in Breckenridge Chamber of Commerce v. Wichita Falls, Ranger & Fort Worth R. R. Co., 109 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 81. That its jurisdiction is exclusive was held in People v. Public Service Commission, 233 N.

QUEZON(1926)\nNo. 309\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 528, 529]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Claro M. Recto, of Manila, Phil. Islands, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Pablo G. Corinsta, of Washington, D. C., and Guillermo B. Guevara, of Manila, Phil. Islands, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This cause was brought here by certiorari under section 5 of the Act of September 6, 1916, to amend Judicial Code, \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1225b). That act repealed section 248 of the Judicial Code, re-enacted by section 27 of the so-called Philippine Autonomy Act, c. 416, 39 Stat. 545, 555 (Comp. St.  1225a), which gave jurisdiction to this court to examine by writ of error the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the Islands in all cases in which the Constitution or any statute, treaty, title or privilege of the United States was involved, or in causes in which the value in controversy exceeded $25,000, and a review of such judgments by writ of certiorari was substituted. The certiorari here was granted because a statute of the United States, to wit, the Autonomy Act, was involved.\n This proceeding was an original action in the Supreme Court of the Philippines, brought by Jose Alejandrino, a Senator appointed by the Governor General, seeking a mandamus and an injunction against the 22 elected members of the Senate, including its president, its secretary, its sergeant at arms, and its paymaster. The occasion for the proceeding was a resolution of the Senate, passed February 5, 1924, and reading as follows:\n'Resolved, that the Honorable Jose Alejandrino, Senator from the Twelfth district, be, and he is hereby, declared guilty of disorderly conduct and flagrant violation of the privileges of the Senate for having treacherously assaulted the Honorable Vicente de Vera, Senator for the Sixth district, on the occasion of certain phrases being uttered by the latter in the course of the debate regarding the credentials of said Mr. Aleiandrino;\n\n'Resolved, further, that the Honorable Jose Alejandrino be, as he is hereby, deprived of all of his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments as such Senator during one year from the first of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-four;\n\n'And resolved, lastly, that the said Honorable Jose Alejandrino, being a Senator appointed by the Governor General of these Islands, a copy of this resolution be furnished said Governor General for his information.' \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner charged that this resolution was unconstitutional and of no effect and asked a preliminary injunction against the respondents enjoining them from executing the resolution, a judicial declaration that it was null and void, and a final order of mandamus against the respondent ordering them to recognize the rights of the petitioner and his office as Senator, and all of his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments and prohibiting them from carrying the order of suspension into effect. The respondents made a special appearance through the Attorney General and objected on demurrer to the court's jurisdiction. The court held that it was without jurisdiction, sustained the demurrer, and as it did not appear that the petition could be amended so as to state a cause of action, it was dismissed without costs.\n\n Jose Alejandrino was appointed under the Philippine Autonomy Act by the Governor General as Senator to represent the Twelfth district, a district composed of non-Christian tribes in the northern part of Luzon and the Moros in the department of Mindanao and Sulu. At the time he took his seat in the Senate, another Senator, Vicente de Vera, made a speech on the credentials of Senator Alejandrino, in which he said some things which Alejandrino resented. At night, and after the session of the Senate concluded, and away from the Senate chamber, Alejandrino assaulted de Vera because of his remarks made in the Senate. The resolution complained of was because of this assault.\n By section 12 of the Autonomy Act (Comp. St.  3813), the general legislative powers in the Philippines, with certain exceptions, are vested in a Legislture consisting of two Houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is composed of 24 members from 12 Senate districts; 22 of them are elected, and one, the Twelfth district, already referred to, has 2 Senators, \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 532]\n\u00a0\n appointed by the Governor General. By section 17 (Comp. St.  3814d), a Senator appointed by the Governor General holds office until removed by the Governor General. Section 18 (Comp. St.  3814e) provides that the Senate and House respectively shall be the sole judges of the elections, returns and qualifications of their elective members, and each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two-thirds expel an elective member. The Senators and Representatives shall receive an annual compensation for their services to be ascertained by law and paid out of the treasury of the Philippine Islands. Senators and Representatives shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses and in going to and returning from the same, and for any speech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place.\n It is argued that as the only power of expulsion given to the Senate is in respect of its elected members, no power is conferred on the Senate to expel a member appointed by the Governor General. It is further argued that the power to suspend is only a less power than the power to expel and of the same character, and therefore that the Senate had no power to suspend an appointed Senator, and therefore that the Senate exceeded its authority in attempting to do so in this resolution, and its action was null.\n We do not think that we can consider this question, for the reason that the period of suspension fixed in the resolution has expired, and, so far as we are advised. Alejandrino is now exercising his functions as a member of the Senate. It is therefore in this court a moot question whether or not he could be suspended in the way in which he was. Equally so is the still more important question whether the Supreme Court of the Philippines \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 533]\n\u00a0\n had any jurisdiction by extraordinary writ of mandamus or injunction to require the Senate, a part of the Island Legislature, and a separate branch of the government, to rescind its resolution and to readmit Alejandrino to the Senate as an active member.\n It may be suggested, as an objection to our vacating the action of the court below, and directing the dismissal of the petition as having become a moot case, that while the lapse of time has made unnecessary and futile a writ of mandamus to restore Senator Alejandrino to the Island Senate, there still remains a right on his part to the recovery of his emoluments, which were withheld during his suspension, and that we ought to retain the case for the purpose of determining whether he may not have a mandamus for this purpose. We are not advised from his petition what the emoluments of his office during that period would be, except his salary. We infer from the averment of his petition that as the suspension was in part retroactive, he was not paid what was due him during the month of January, 1924. It is difficult for the court to deal with this feature of the case, which is really only a mere incident to the main question made in the petition and considered in the able and extended brief of counsel for the petitioner and the only brief before us. That brief is not in any part of it directed to the subject of emoluments, nor does it refer us to any statute or to the rules of the Senate by which the method of paying Senators' salaries is provided, or in a definite way describe the duties of the officer or officers or committee charged with the ministerial function of paying them. The petition in describing the defendants avers that certain of them being Senators 'are besides members of the committee on accounts of the Senate who approve the payment of the emoluments that Senators are entitled to receive.' Section 7 of the petition is as follows:\n'That the defendants, in the respective capacities in which they are sued, attempt to comply with, execute and \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 534]\n\u00a0\n carry into effect, or to cause to be complied with, executed and carried into effect, the suspension of the plaintiff depriving him, during the period of one year, of the exercise of his office and of all of his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments as Senator, as said defendant Senators and their president do not recognize the plaintiff's right to exercise such office and prevent him from exercising same, and cause all the officers, employe  and other subordinates of the Senate not to recognize the plaintiff as Senator and to prevent him from exercising his office and enjoying his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments, and the president of the Senate, moreover, gives the necessary orders for the carrying into effect of said order of suspension, and the other defendants Faustino Aguilar and Bernabe Bustamente execute and comply with the orders and restrictions of the Senate and its president in order that the plaintiff may not be recognized as Senator and may not exercise his prerogatives and privileges as such Senator in the Senate building and the defendant Francisco Dayaw, official paymaster of the Senate requires him to refund his emoluments received corresponding to the period that has already elapsed from January 1st of this year and refuses to pay the emoluments to which the plaintiff is entitled.'\n\n We must assume, in view of the injunction of Congress in the Autonomy Act, that Senators shall receive an annual compensation to be fixed by law, that there is some official or board charged with the executive and ministerial duty of paying the senatorial salaries against whom a Senator entitled might procure a mandamus to compel payment. But the averments of the petition do not set out with sufficient clearness who that official or set of officials may be. Were that set out, the remedy of the Senator would seem to be by mandamus to compel such official in the discharge of his ministerial duty to pay him the salary due, and the presence of the Senate \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 535]\n\u00a0\n as a party would be unnecessary. Should that official rely upon the resolution of the Senate as a reason for refusing to comply with his duty to pay Senators, the validity of such a defense and the validity of the resolution might become a judicial question affecting the personal right of the complaining Senator properly to be disposed of in such action, but not requiring the presence of the Senate as a party for its adjudication. The right of the petitioner to his salary does not therefore involve the very serious issue raised in this petition as to the power of the Philippine Supreme Court to compel by mandamus one of the two legislative bodies constituting the legislative branch of the government to rescind a resolution adopted by it in asserted lawful discipline of one of its members for disorder and breach of privilege. We think, now that the main question as to the validity of the suspension has become moot, the incidental issue as to the remedy which the suspended Senator may have in recovery of his emoluments if illegally withheld, should properly be tried in a separate proceeding against an executive officer or officers as described. As we are not able to derive from the petition sufficient information upon which properly to afford such a remedy, we must treat the whole cause as moot and act accordingly. This action on our part of course is without prejudice to a suit by Senator Alejandrino against the proper executive officer or committee by way of mandamus or otherwise to obtain payment of the salary which may have been unlawfully withheld from him.\n The case having become moot as respects its main features, and the other feature being incidental and not in itself a proper subject for determination as now presented, further steps looking to an adjudication of the cause can neither be had here nor in the court below. In this situation, we must, following the established practice of this court, vacate the judgment below and remand \n\n[271 U.S. 528, 536]\n\u00a0\n the cause, with directions to dismiss the petition, without costs to either party.

Davis-Bournonville Co. \n270 U.S. 390\n (1926) ]\n\n\n[270 U.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dean S. Edmonds, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for the infringement of the plaintiff's patent for an improvement in welding and cutting apparatus alleged to have been the invention of one Whitford. The suit embraced other matters but this is the only one material here. The defence is that Whitford was not the first inventor of the thing patented, and the answer gives notice that to prove the invalidity of the patent evidence will be offered that one Clifford invented the thing, his patent being referred to and identified. The application for the plaintiff's patent was filed on March 4, 1911, and the patent was issued on June 4, 1912. There was no evidence carrying Whitford's invention further back. Clifford's application was filed on January 31, 1911, before Whitford's, and his patent was issued on February 6, 1912. It is not disputed that this application gave a complete and adequate description of the thing patented to Whitford, but it did not claim it. The District Court gave the plaintiff a decree, holding that while Clifford might have added this claim to his application, yet as he did not, he was not a prior inventor. 297 F. 846. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 1 F.(2d) 227. There is a conflict between this decision and those of other Circuit Courts of Appeal, especially the sixth. Lemley v. Dobson-Evans Co., 243 F. 391, 156 C. C. A. 171. Naceskid Service Chain Co. v. Perdue, 1 F.(2d) 924. Therefore a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 45 S. Ct. 93, \n266 U.S. 596\n.\n The patent law authorizes a person who has invented an improvement like the present, 'not known or used by others in this country, before his invention,' etc., to obtain a patent for it. Rev. Sts. s 4886, amended by Act March 3, 1897, c. 391, s 1, 29 Stat. 692 (Comp. St. s 9430). Among the defences to a suit for infringement the fourth specified by the statute is that the patentee 'was not the original and first in- \n\n[270 U.S. 390, 400]\n\u00a0\n ventor or discoverer of any material and substantial part of the thing patented.' Rev. Sts. s 4920, amended by Act March 3, 1897, c. 391, s 2, 29 Stat. 692 (Comp. St. s 9466). Taking these words in their natural sense as they would be read by the common man, obviously one is not the first inventor if, as was the case here, somebody else has made a complete and adequate description of the thing claimed before the earliest moment to which the alleged inventor can carry his invention back. But the words cannot be taken quite so simply. In view of the gain to the public that the patent laws mean to secure we assume for purposes of decision that it would have been no bar to Whitford's patent if Clifford had written out his prior description and kept it in his portfolio uncommunicated to anyone. More than that, since the decision in the case of the Cornplanter Patent, 23 Wall. 181, it is said, at all events for many years, the Patent Office has made no search among abandoned patent applications, and by the words of the statute a previous foreign invention does not invalidate a patent granted here if it has not been patented or described in a printed publication. Rev. Sts. s 4923 (Comp. St. s 9469). See Westinghouse Machine Co. v. General Electric Co., 207 F. 75, 126 C. C. A. 575. These analogies prevailed in the minds of the courts below.\n On the other hand publication in a periodical is a bar. This as it seems to us is more than an arbitrary enactment, and illustrates, as does the rule concerning previous public use, the principle that, subject to the exceptions mentioned, one really must be the first inventor in order to be entitled to a patent. Coffin v. Ogden, 18 Wall. 120. We understand the Circuit Court of Appeals to admit that if Whitford had not applied for his patent until after the issue to Clifford, the disclosure by the latter would have had the same effect as the publication of the same words in a periodical, although not made the basis of a claim. 1 F.(2d) 233. The invention is made public property \n\n[270 U.S. 390, 401]\n\u00a0\n as much in the one case as in the other. But if this be true, as we think that it is, it seems to us that a sound distinction cannot be taken between that case and a patent applied for before but not granted until after a second patent is sought. The delays of the patent office ought not to cut down the effect of what has been done. The description shows that Whitford was not the first inventor. Clifford had done all that he could do to make his description public. He had taken steps that would make it public as soon as the Patent Office did its work, although, of course, amendments might be required of him before the end could be reached. We see no reason in the words or policy of the law for allowing Whitford to profit by the delay and make himself out to be the first inventor when he was not so in fact, when Clifford had shown knowledge inconsistent with the allowance of Whitford's claim, (Webster) Loom Co. v. Higgins, \n105 U.S. 580\n, and when otherwise the publication of his patent would abandon the thing described to the public unless it already was old, McClain v. Ortmayer, 12 S. Ct. 76, \n141 U.S. 419\n, 424. Underwood v. Gerber, 13 S. Ct. 854, \n149 U.S. 224\n, 230.\n The question is not whether Clifford showed himself by the description to be the first inventor. By putting it in that form it is comparatively easy to take the next step and say that he is not an inventor in the sense of the statute unless he makes a claim. The question is whether Clifford's disclosure made it impossible for Whitford to claim the invention at a later date. The disclosure would have had the same effect as at present if Clifford had added to his description a statement that he did not claim the thing described because he abandoned it or because he believed it to be old. It is not necessary to show who did invent the thing in order to show that Whitford did not.\n It is said that without a claim the thing described is not reduced to practice. But this seems to us to rest on \n\n[270 U.S. 390, 402]\n\u00a0\n a false theory helped out by the fiction that by a claim it is reduced to practice. A new application and a claim may be based on the original description within two years, and the original priority established notwithstanding intervening claims. Chapman v. Wintroath, 40 S. Ct. 234, \n252 U.S. 126\n, 137. A description that would bar a patent if printed in a periodical or in an issued patent is equally effective in an application so far as reduction to practice goes.\n As to the analogies relied upon below, the disregard of abandoned patent applications however explained cannot be taken to establish a principle beyond the rule as actually applied. As an empirical rule it no doubt is convenient if not necessary to the Patent Office, and we are not disposed to disturb it, although we infer that originally the practice of the Office was different. The policy of the statute as to foreign inventions obviously stands on its own footing and cannot be applied to domestic affairs. The fundamental rule we repeat is that the patentee must be the first inventor. The qualifications in aid of a wish to encourage improvements or to avoid laborious investigations do not prevent the rule from applying here.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN STEEL FOUNDRIES v. ROBERTSON(1926)\nNo. 156\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 372, 373]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George L. Wilkinson, of Chicago, Ill., for American Steel foundries.\n Messrs. Nathan Heard and Frederick A. Tennant, both of Boston, Mass., for Simplex Electric Heating Co.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 372, 377]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff and its predecessor, and Simplex Railway Appliance Company, have used the trade-mark 'Simplex' \n\n[269 U.S. 372, 378]\n\u00a0\n on railway car bolsters since 1897, and on car couplers since 1907; the former being registered in the Patent Office in 1911, the latter in 1909. In 1917 plaintiff adopted and thereafter used the same trade-mark on brake rigging, brake heads, brake beams, brake shoes, brake hangers, and clasp brakes. Application was made in 1917 to register the trade-mark for the last-named uses, but the Commissioner of Patents refused the registration, on the ground that the trade-mark consisted merely in the name of a corporation, viz. the Simplex Electric Heating Company, defendant herein. The Commissioner's ruling was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. In re American Steel Foundries, 49 App. D. C. 16, 258 F. 160. The case came to this court on certiorari, but was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, sub nom. American Steel Foundries v. Whitehead, Commissioner of Patents, \n256 \nU.S. 40\n, 41 S. Ct. 407.\n Thereupon this suit in equity was brought in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, under section 4915, R. S. being Comp. St.  9460 (American Foundries v. Robertson, \n262 \nU.S. 209\n, 43 S. Ct. 541), to which the Commissioner of Patents voluntarily appeared. That court dismissed the bill, and an appeal to the Court of Appeals followed.\n The defendant company was organized as a corporation in 1902. Its predecessors in business had adopted in 1886, and thereafter had used, the trade-mark 'Simplex' on insulating or protected conducting wire, the same being registered in 1890. In 1906, the company registered trade-marks comprising the word 'Simplex' as applied to a large variety of other goods.\n The word 'Simplex' has comprised the whole or a part of trade-marks registered in the Patent Office in approximately 60 registrations by nearly as many different parties, and as applied to many classes of merchandise. There are other corporations in the country, which now have or have had names which embody the word 'Sim- \n\n[269 U.S. 372, 379]\n\u00a0\n plex.' Neither the defendant company nor its predecessors ever have been engaged in the manufacture or sale of any of the devices upon which plaintiff has used the trade-mark as hereinbefore specified.\n Upon these facts the court below has certified the following questions upon which it desires instruction:\n'1. Does the clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 'Provided, that no mark which consists merely in the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner, or in association with a portrait of an individual ... shall be registered under the terms of this act,' prohibit registration as a trade-mark under said act of the word 'Simplex' by the plaintiff under the recited facts?\n\n'2. Does the said clause quoted of section 5 prohibit registration under the Act of February 20, 1905, of a trade-mark consisting solely of a single word, otherwise registrable under the said act, if that word is the salient feature of the name of a corporation, not the applicant for registration?\n\n'3. Does the above-quoted clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, prohibit the registration under said act of a common-law trade-mark which is the name, or part of the name, of another than the applicant, whose business relates exclusively to goods in a different and noncompeting class from the goods on which the trade-mark is used by the applicant?'\n\n For the purposes of discussion, these three questions may be resolved shortly into one: Upon the facts, is the word 'Simplex' merely the name of the Simplex Electric Heating Company within the meaning of the quoted proviso? The answer to this question will be simplified if we approach it by first considering certain principles of the substantive law of trade- marks and unfair competition, in the light of which the legislation under review must be examined.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 372, 380]\n\u00a0\n The mere fact that one person has adopted and used a trade-mark on his goods does not prevent the adoption and use of the same trade-mark by others on articles of a different description. There is no property in a trade-mark apart from the business or trade in connection with which it is employed. United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co., \n248 \nU.S. 90, 97\n, 39 S. Ct. 48; Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 U.S. 403\n, 413-414, 36 S. Ct. 357, 360 (60 L. Ed. 713). 'The law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition' (Id.), the general purpose of which is to prevent one person from passing off his goods or his business as the goods or business of another.\n Whether the name of a corporation is to be regarded as a trade-mark, a trade-name, or both, is not entirely clear under the decisions. To some extent the two terms overlap, but there is a difference, more or less definitely recognized, which is that, generally speaking, the former is applicable to the vendible commodity to which it is affixed, the latter to a business and its good will. See Ball v. Broadway Bazaar, 194 N. Y. 429, 434, 435, 87 N. E. 674. A corporate name seems to fall more appropriately into the latter class. But the precise difference is not often material, since the law affords protection against its appropriation in either view, upon the same fundamental principles. The effect of assuming a corporate name by a corporation under the law of its creation is to exclusively appropriate that name. It is an element of the corporation's existence. Newby v. Oregon Cent. Ry. Co. et al., Deady, 609, 616, 18 Fed. Cas. 38, No. 10,144. And, as Judge Deady said in that case:\n'Any act which produces confusion or uncertainty concerning this name is well calculated to injuriously affect the identity and business of a corporation. And as a matter of fact, in some degree, at least, the natural and necessary consequence of the wrongful appropriation of a corporate name, is to injure the business and rights of the corporation by destroying or confusing its identity.'\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 372, 381]\n\u00a0\n The general doctrine is that equity not only will enjoin the appropriation and use of a trade-mark or trade-name, where it is completely identical with the name of the corporation, but will enjoin such appropriation and use where the resemblance is so close as to be likely to produce confusion as to such identity, to the injury of the corporation to which the name belongs.

Judicial interference will depend upon the facts proved and found in each case. Hendriks v. Montagu, L. R. 17 Ch. Div. 638, 648; Higgins Co. v. Higgins Soap Co., 144 N. Y. 462, 469-471, 39 N. E. 490, 27 L. R. A. 42, 43 Am. St. Rep. 769.\n These principles, it must be assumed, were in mind when Congress came to enact the registration statute. And, since that body has been given no power to legislate upon the substantive law of trade-marks, it reasonably may be assumed, also, that to the extent the contrary does not appear from the statute, the intention was to allow the registration of such marks as that law, and the general law of unfair competition of which it is a part, recognized as legitimate. The House committee on patents, in reporting the bill which upon enactment became the registration statute in question, said:\n'Section 5 of the proposed bill we believe will permit the registration of all marks which could, under the common law as expounded by the courts, be the subject of a trade-mark and become the exclusive property of the party using the same as his trade-mark.' Report No. 3147, Dec. 19, 1904, H. of R. 58th Cong., 3d Sess.\n\n The provision, therefore, that no mark consisting merely in the name of a corporation shall be registered, is to be construed in harmony with those established principles in respect of the appropriation of corporate names to which we have referred. Where the appropriation of the corporate name is complete, the rule of the statute, by its own \n\n[269 U.S. 372, 382]\n\u00a0\n terms, is absolute, and the proposed mark must be denied registration, without more; but, where less than the whole name has been appropriated, the right of registration will turn upon whether it appears that such partial appropriation is of such character and extent that, under the facts of the particular case, it is calculated to deceive or confuse the public to the injury of the corporation to which the name belongs.\n The fact, for example, that the articles upon which the mark is used are not of the same description as those put out by the corporation, is entitled to weight, since the probability of such confusion and injury in that situation obviously is more remote than where the articles are of like kind. The cases, naturally, present varying degrees of difficulty for the application of the rule. Primarily the power and the duty rests with the Commissioner of Patents to determine the question in each case, in the exercise of an instructed judgment upon a consideration of all the pertinent facts.\n In the present case, these facts are: The word 'Simplex' is only a portion of the corporate name; its use by plaintiff is upon articles the like of which has never been manufactured or sold by the defendant corporation; it comprises the whole or a part of about 60 registrations, by nearly as many different parties upon many kinds of merchandise; and it forms part of the names of other corporations in the country. \n1\n It is argued that the word in question is the salient feature in the name of the defendant corporation; but that, if conceded, does not \n\n[269 U.S. 372, 383]\n\u00a0\n settle the question. There may be, of course, instances where a single word in the corporate name has become so identified with the particular corporation that, whenever used, it designates to the mind of the public that particular corporation. But here it is not shown that, standing, alone, the word 'Simplex' has that effect; that it is any more calculated to denote to the public the defendant corporation than any of the other corporations in the names of which it is likewise embodied; or, indeed, that it signifies the appropriation of some corporate name though incapable of exact identification. In Simplex Electric Heating Co. v. Ramey Co., Decisions Com'r Pat. 1916, pp. 74, 77, 79, 82, 83, the Commissioner of Patents, admitting the same work to registry under like facts, said:\n Simplex Arms Manufacturing Company, Denver; Simplex Window Company, San Francisco; Simplex Lubricating Company, Boston; Simplex Wire & Cable Company, Boston; Simplex Auto Specialty Company, Detroit; Simplex Concrete Piling Company, Cincinnati; Simplex Machine Company, Atlanta; Simplex Exercising Company, Philadelphia; Simplex Valve & Meter Company, Philadelphia; Simplex Floor Surfacing Company, Baltimore; Simplex Railway Appliance Company, St. Louis; Simplex Air Brake & Manufacturing Company, Pittsburgh; Simplex Button Works, New York; Simplex Fire Extinguisher Company, New York; Simplex Golf Practice Machine Corporation, New York; Simplex Ink Company, New York; Simplex Letter Opener Company, New York; Simplex Typewriter Company, New York; Simplex Refrigerating Machine Company, Chicago; Simplex Sand Blast Manufacturing Company, Chicago.\n'It is a fact that the word 'Simplex' has been in such wide and varied use in this country, not only as a trade-mark, but as part of a firm or corporation name that everybody has heretofore considered something more than the word 'Simplex' necessary to identify a corporation. ...\n\n'The word 'Simplex' does not identify any corporation in particular, for the simple reason that it is equally the name of various corporations. In short, if one referred to 'the company Simplex,' without anything else, it would not be known to what he was referring . ...\n\n'The word involved in this case is one of a large class of words which have for a great many years been much used because of their peculiarly suggestive meaning. For \n\n[269 U.S. 372, 384]\n\u00a0\n other examples there are the words 'Acme,' 'Anchor,' 'Champion,' 'Eureka,' 'Excelsior,' 'Ideal,' 'Jewel,' 'Liberty,' 'National,' 'Pride,' 'Premier,' 'Queen,' 'Royal,' 'Star,' 'Sunlight,' 'Triumph,' 'Victor.' It would be a serious matter if the law actually permitted any one who chose to do so to organize a series of corporations with names containing these words, respectively, and thereupon virtually withdraw these words from public use as trade-marks and monopolize them, by preventing their registry as such.'\n\n On appeal to the District Court of Appeals, the decision of the Commissioner was reversed, upon the ground, in part, that the word 'Simplex' was a distinctive part of the name of the corporation (Simplex Electric Heating Co. v. Ramey Co., 46 App. D. C. 400, 406); and this was followed by the same court in the present case. It already is apparent that we agree with the Commissioner, and not with the court.\n Under the facts, we are of opinion that it does not appear that the use of the word as a trade-mark upon the goods of the plaintiff will probably confuse or deceive the public, to the injury of the defendant or of any other corporation. It follows that the refusal to allow the registration was erroneous.\n Question No. 1, therefore, should be answered in the negative, and, since this will dispose of the case, categorical answers to the other questions are deemed not necessary.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Commissioner of Patents, in a footnote to Simplex Electric Heating Co. v. Ramey Co., Decisions Com'r Pat. 1916, pp. 74, 78, gives the following list of corporations, in the names of which the word 'Simplex' occurs: \n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDERSON v. SHIPOWNERS' ASS'N OF PACIFIC COAST(1926)\nNo. 306\nArgued: Decided: November 22, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. W. Hutton, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. F. Eldridge, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin the respondents from maintaining a combination in restraint of interstate and foreign commerce in violation of section 1 of the Anti-Trust Act, chapter 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820), and to recover damages. Such a suit is authorized by sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, chapter 323, 38 Stat. 730, 731, 737 (Comp. St.  8835d, 8835o). Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 464\n, 465 S., 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196. Upon respondents' motion, the District Court dismissed the bill of complaint apparently upon the merits, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 10 F.(2d) 96. The only question necessary to be considered here is whether the bill states a case within the Anti-Trust Act.\n The bill is not concisely drawn and the application of its allegations is to some degree obscured by references to acts of Congress regulating commerce, other than the Anti-Trust Act. For present purposes the pertinent allegations, shortly stated, are as follows: Petitioner is a \n\n[272 U.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n seaman, and has followed that calling for more than 20 years on ships engaged in the carrying trade among the states on the Pacific Coast and with foreign countries. He is member of the Seamen's Union of America, having a membership of about 10,000 seamen engaged in various forms of maritime service in the same field, and he sues on their behalf, as well as his own. The members of the respondent associations own, operate, or control substantially all the merchant vessels of American registry engaged in interstate and foreign commerce among the ports of the Pacific Coast and with foreign countries. These associations and their members have entered into a combination to control the employment, upon such vessels, of all seamen upon the Pacific Coast, and to that end the associations have established and maintain offices in San Francisco and San Pedro, Cal., where seamen are engaged and supplied to the operators of the vessels. Among other requirements, every seaman seeking employment is compelled to register, receive a number, and await his turn according to the number, before he can obtain employment, the result of which is that seamen, well qualified and well known, are frequently prevented from obtaining employment at once, when, but for these conditions, they would be able to do so. A certificate is issued to each seaman, which he is obliged to carry and present in order to obtain employment. The certificate, in part, recites that no person will be employed unless registered; that the certificate must be delivered to the master of the vessel upon articles being signed; that the certificate is the personal record of the seaman and the basis of his future employment. At the same time, two cards are issued-one to the seaman, assigning him to a specified employment, and another to the ship, reciting the capacity in which the seaman is to be employed, with the statement that 'he must not be employed on your ship in any capacity unless he presents \n\n[272 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n an assignment card, grey in color, issued by us and addressed to your vessel, designating the position to which we have assigned him.' The associations fix the wages which shall be paid the seamen. Under the regulations, when a seaman's turn comes, he must take the employment then offered or none, whether it is suited to his qualifications, or whether he wishes to engage on the particular vessel or for the particular voyage, and the officers of the vessels are deprived of the right to select their own men or those deemed most suitable. Without a compliance with the foregoing requirements, no seaman can be employed on any of the vessels owned or operated by members of the associations.\n It is further alleged that the petitioner sought employment through the San Francisco office of the associations and was refused registration because he failed to produce a discharge book. At a later time he was employed by the mate of a vessel engaged in coastwise interstate traffic, but was required by the mate to apply at the office of the associations for assignment as a sailor; that upon application being thus made such assignment was refused; that, nevertheless, he was directed by the mate to report on board for duty; that he did report, but was informed by the mate that he had been ordered to take no seamen, except through the office of the associations, and in consequence petitioner lost the employment, to his damage in a sum stated.\n From these averments, the conclusion results that each of the shipowners and operators, by entering into this combination, has, in respect of the employment of seamen, surrendered himself completely to the control of the associations. If the restraint thus imposed had related to the carriage of goods in interstate and foreign commerce-that is to say, if each shipowner had precluded himself from making any contract of transportation directly with the shipper, and had put himself under an obligation to \n\n[272 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n refuse to carry for any person without the previous approval of the associations-the unlawful restraint would be clear. But ships and those who operate them are instrumentalities of commerce, and within the commerce clause, no less than cargoes. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 49 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. And, as was said by this court in United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 39 S. Ct. 465, 468 (63 L. Ed. 992, 7 A. L. R. 443):\n'The purpose of the Sherman Act is to prohibit monopolies, contracts, and combinations which probably would unduly interfere with the free exercise of their rights by those engaged, or who wish to engage, in trade and commerce-in a word to preserve the right of freedom to trade.'\n\n That the effect of the combination now under consideration, both as to the seamen and the owners, is precisely what this language condemns, is made plain by the allegations of the bill which we have just summarized. The absence of an allegation that such was the specific intent is not important, since that is the necessary and direct consequence of the combination and the acts of the associations under it, and they cannot be heard to say the contrary. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 543\n, 33 S. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325. It is not important, therefore, to inquire whether, as contended by respondents, the object of the combination was merely to regulate of employment of men, and not to restrain commerce. A restraint of interstate commerce cannot be justified by the fact that the object of the participants in the combination was to benefit themselves in a way which might have been unobjectionable, in the absence of such restraint. Duplex Co. v. Deering, supra, page 468 (41 S. Ct. 172); Ellis v. Inman, Poulsen & Co., 131 F. 182, 186, 65 C. C. A. 488.\n Respondents rely on Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64\n, 45 S. Ct. 403, United Leather Workers v. Herkert, \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S. Ct. 623, 33 A. L. R. 566, and United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762; but these cases are not in point. The conspiracies or combinations in all three related to local \n\n[272 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n matters-the first, to building in San Francisco; the second, to manufacturing; and the third, to mining operations-and the effect upon interstate commerce was held to be purely indirect and secondary. Neither the making of goods nor the mining of coal is commerce, and the fact that the things produced are afterwards shipped or used in interstate commerce does not make their production a part of it. Nor is building commerce, and the fact that the materials to be used are shipped in from other states does not make building a part of such interstate commerce. In the Industrial Association Case, after a reference to the two earlier decisions (pages 80, 82), it was said (page 82 (45 S. Ct. 408)):\n'The alleged conspiracy and the acts here complained of spent their intended and direct force upon a local situation, for building is as essentially local as mining, manufacturing, or growing crops, and if, by a resulting diminution of the commercial demand, interstate trade was curtailed, either generally or in specific instances, that was a fortuitous consequence so remote and indirect as plainly to cause it to fall outside the reach of the Sherman Act.'\n\n Here, however, the combination and the acts complained of did not spend their intended and direct force upon a local situation. On the contrary, they related to the employment of seamen for service on ships, both of them instrumentalities of, and intended to be used in, interstate and foreign commerce, and the immediate force of the combination, both in purpose and execution, was directed toward affecting such commerce. The interference with commerce, therefore, was direct and primary, and not, as in the cases cited, incidental, indirect, and secondary.\n Taking the allegations of the bill at their face value, as we must do, in the absence of countervailing facts or explanations, it appears that each shipowner and operator in this widespread combination has surrendered his freedom of action in the matter of employing seamen and \n\n[272 U.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n agreed to abide by the will of the associations. Such is the fair interpretation of the combination and of the various requirements under it, and this is borne out by the actual experience of the petitioner in his efforts to secure employment. These shipowners and operators having thus put themselves into a situation of restraint upon their freedom to carry on interstate and foreign commerce according to their own choice and discretion, it follows, as the case now stands, that the combination is in violation of the Anti-Trust Act.\n Decree reversed, and cause remanded to the District Court, for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAPPLEBY v. CITY OF NEW YORK(1926)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n This is a writ of error to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of New York as affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Appleby v. City of New York, 199 App. Div. 539, 192 N. Y. S. 211; Id., 235 N. Y. 351, 139 N. E. 474. The plaintiffs are executors of Charles E. Appleby, and hold deeds in fee simple from the city of New York, made in 1853 and 1852, one to their testator Appleby, and one to Latou, who later con- \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n veyed to Appleby. The land conveyed consists of two water lots in the city of New York on the east side of North River. This suit was brought in 1914 to restrain the defendant, the city of New York, and its codefendants, lessees of the city's piers, from dredging the land under water conveyed by the deeds, and from using the water over the lots of the plaintiffs as slips and mooring places for vessels alongside those piers.\n The Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals denied relief. This is a writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214), sued out on the ground that by its judgment, the Supreme Court of New York has upheld and enforced statutes of the state enacted in 1857 and 1871 in such a way as to impair the obligation of the plaintiffs' deeds, in violation of section 10, article 1, of the federal Constitution.\n The city of New York was established before the Revolution by a charter of Governor Dongan in 1686, and by a subsequent charter of Governor Montgomery of 1730, under both of which it acquired title to the tideway-i. e., the strip between high and low water-surrounding the island of Manhattan. These grants were confirmed by the Constitution of 1777 of the state of New York. By the act of 1807 (Laws 1807, p. 125, c. 115) the state granted to the city a strip of land under water along the westerly side of the Island, which extended from low-water mark westerly into the Hudson river, a distance of 400 feet.\n In 1837, the Legislature passed a law (Laws 1837, c. 182), making Thirteenth avenue as laid out by the city surveyor the permanent exterior street along the easterly shore of the North or Hudson river in the district where these lots are. It extended the streets already ready laid out to Thirteenth avenue, and further provided that it should be construed to grant to the city forever the said lands under water easterly of Thirteenth avenue. \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n In pursuance of this law, ordinances were passed by the sinking fund trustees of New York providing that the lands under water belonging to the city under its several charters might be sold and conveyed by such city to parties desiring to purchase the same, giving priority to the owners of the adjacent uplands. The ordinances were recognized and approved by the state Legislature in chapter 225 of the Laws of 1845, and the city then made the deeds here to be considered.\n The grant to Appleby was made on August 1, 1853, for the consideration of $6,367.37; that to Latou on December 24, 1852, for $4,937. 50. The one covered land under water between Thirty-Ninth and Fortieth streets and high-water mark and Thirteenth avenue; the other land between Fortieth and Forty-First streets and high-water mark and Thirteenth avenue. The wording and covenants of the deeds were alike, mutatis mutandis. It will be enough to describe the Appleby deed. That granted:\n'All that certain water lot or vacant ground and soil under water to be made land and gained out of the Hudson or North River or harbor of New York, and bounded, described, and containing as follows; that is to say:\n\n'Beginning at a point of intersection of the line of original high- water mark with the line of the center of Thirty-Ninth street and running thence westerly, along said center line of Thirty-Ninth street, about 1,065 feet, to the westerly line or side of Thirteenth avenue, said westerly line or side of the Thirteenth avenue being the permanent exterior line of said city, as established by law; thence northerly along the westerly line or side of the Thirteenth avenue, 258 feet 4 1\/2 inches, to a line running through the center of Fortieth street; thence easterly along said center line of Fortieth street, about 1,126 feet 11 \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n inches, to the line of original high-water mark; and thence in a southerly direction along said center line of original high-water mark, as it runs to the point or place of beginning, as particularly described, designated, and shown on a map hereto annexed, dated New York, June, 1853, made by John J. Serrel, city surveyor, and to which reference may be had; said map being considered a part of this indenture.\n\n'The premises conveyed being colored pink1 on said map, be the same dimensions more or less.\n\n'Saving and reserving from and out of the hereby granted premises, so much thereof, as by said map annexed forms part or portions of the Twelfth and Thirteenth avenues, Thirty-Ninth and Fortieth streets for the uses and purposes of public streets. ...\n\n'To have and to hold the said premises hereby granted to the said Charles E. Appleby, his heirs, and assigns to his own proper use, benefit and behoof forever.'\n\n The pink map of lot referred to in the deed is on the following page.\n Appleby in the deed covenanted with the city that, within three months after the city required it, he would built four bulkheads and wharves, and fill in and pave such parts of Twelfth and Thirteenth avenues and Thirty-Ninth and Fortieth streets as lay within the premises described, and keep them in repair, with the provision that in default the city might make them at the cost of Appleby, or sell and dispose of the premises, or any part, at public auction to supply the deficiency, and grant the land and the wharfage to other persons. Appleby further convenanted to pay all taxes on the lot, and not to build the wharves, bulkheads, avenues, or streets until permission was given by the city.\n The city covenanted that Appleby and his heirs and assigns should receive:\n'All manner of wharfage, cranage advantages or emoluments growing or accruing by or from that part of the said exterior line of the said city, lying\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n-Continued\n\n\u00a0\n on the westerly side of the hereby granted premises fronting on the Hudson river excepting therefrom wharfage from the westerly end of the bulkhead in front of the entire width of the northerly half part of Thirty-Ninth street and the southerly half part of Fortieth street, which were reserved to the city.' \n At the time of these deeds, there was no filling between the high- water mark and Twelfth avenue, but since that time, and before 1871, the lots were filled by Appleby from high-water mark to within 4 feet of the easterly side of Twelfth avenue, a distance of approximately 500 feet.\n In 1855 (Laws 1855, c. 121), for the avowed reason that grants had been made and piers built which obstructed the river navigation, provision was made for a harbor commission to prepare plans for harbor improvement and as a result chapter 763, Laws 1857, was passed to establish for the harbor bulkhead and pier lines. In its second section it provided:\n'It shall not be lawful to fill in with earth, stone, or other solid material in the waters of said port, beyond the bulkhead line or line of solid filling hereby established, nor shall it be lawful to erect any structure exterior to the said bulkhead line, except the sea wall mentioned in the first section of this act, and piers which shall not exceed seventy feet in width respectively, with intervening water spaces of at least one hundred feet, nor shall it be lawful to extend such pier or piers beyond the exterior or pier line, nor beyond, or outside of the said sea wall.'\n In the same year, by virtue of the act, the harbor commission established a bulkhead line beyond which there could be no solid filling at 100 feet west of Twelfth avenue.\n The necessary effect of this legislation and action, if made effective, was to abolish Thirteenth avenue as a ripa or exterior line on the river, and to prevent the filling of plaintiffs' lots outshore from the bulkhead line, and the making of docks on the lots, and the enjoyment of wharfage at the ends thereof within 100 feet of the city's piers. \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n By Laws 1871, c. 574,  6, which amended section 99 of the Act of April 5, 1870 (Laws 1870, c. 137), relating to the government of the city of New York, it was provided that the department of docks should be established, that it should determine upon such plans as they deemed wise for the whole or any part of the water front, and submit them to the commissioners of the sinking fund, who might adopt or reject any such plan. After the plan was adopted, no wharf, pier, bulkhead, basin, dock, slip or any wharf, structure, or superstructure should thereafter be laid out or constructed within the territory or district embraced in the specified upon such plan except in accordance with the plan. The decept partment was authorized in the act of 1871 to acquire, in the name and for the benefit of the city, any and all wharf property in the city to which the city had no right or title, and any rights and easements, and any rights, terms, easements, and privileges, pertaining to any wharf property in the city, and not owned by the city, by purchase or by condemnation. By the act of 1871, the bulkhead line for solid filling was fixed at 150 feet west of Twelfth avenue, instead of 100 feet, as previously fixed.\n In 1890, the Secretary of War fixed the same bulkhead line as that fixed by dock commissioner under the act of 1871. Thereupon, in 1894, a condemnation proceeding was begun by the city against Appleby to appropriate both lots. It was delayed for 20 years, presumably for a lack of funds. In 1914 it was discontinued by the city. This action was commenced shortly thereafter.\n During the pendency of the condemnation proceeding, the city constructed concrete and steel piers against plaintiffs' objection within the lines of West Thirty-Ninth street, of Fortieth street, and Forty-First street, beginning at or near Twelfth avenue and extending westerly to and beyond Thirteenth avenue. It placed thereon iron or steel sheds and leased these to tenants excluding the public from the piers. The piers have numerous doors and windows which open on \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n to the water over the Appleby lots, so that boats are constantly moored and fastened alongside of the piers and in the adjoining slips upon plaintiffs' premises and discharge their cargoes and freight into the sheds. The city also constructed an overhanging dumping board or platform extending northerly from the Thirty-Ninth street pier for the use of its tenants over the same water. The city has from time to time dredged plaintiffs' premises between its piers without their consent to a depth of about 20 feet, and threatens to continue to do so. West of the bulkhead line the depth of water varied from 4 feet in 1884 to 20 feet now. East of the line the bottom was an average depth of 3 feet, and was dredged to 16 or 20 feet as far east as 50 feet from the west side of Twelfth avenue, or 100 feet inside the bulkhead line. The record contains reports in 10 years, between 1895 and 1905, showing dredging of about 150,000 cubic yards in the two slips or basins. From its piers, made more valuable by the use of these slips and mooring places, the city receives substantial rentals and income from its lessees and other occupants of the piers.\n No request was ever made by the city that Appleby should fill the streets, which he covenanted to fill on the city's call, and not to fill until that. After the act of 1871, the city built the piers, and the streets and avenues specified in the deeds, so far as they have been built. Thirteenth avenue, being out shore from the bulkhead line fixed in 1857 and 1871, was never filled.\n In January, 1917, the plaintiffs were required to pay as back taxes upon these lots the sum of $74,426.01.\n The prayer of the petition is that the city and its tenants and the other defendants be enjoined from using plaintiffs' lots as a slip or permanent mooring place and from dredging them.\n The Special Term of the Supreme Court held that the deeds here in question conveyed a fee-simple title to the \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs, carrying both the jus publicum and the jus privatum, and that their rights could not be affected by the act of 1857 and the act of 1871, or the orders of the dock commissioners under that act, but that the establishment of the bulkhead line by the Secretary of War in 1890 made the waters of the Hudson river westerly of that line open and in use for purposes of commerce and navigation, and that no action to restrain or prevent the use of that water for loading or unloading at the city piers would lie, but that the city was without right to dredge any soil or part of the granted premises east of the bulkhead line, and should be enjoined from doing so. The Special Term refused damages for the dredging which had been done for failure to adduce proper evidence as to what the damages were and allowed only a nominal recovery.\n On appeal, the Appellate Division also held that the deeds carried to the plaintiffs the jus publicum and the jus privatum from the city and the state, and that the plaintiffs' rights under the deeds could not be affected by the acts of 1857 and 1871, but closed its findings and conclusions as follows:\n'The federal statutes and the action of the Secretary of War in establishing a bulkhead line across the granted premises thereby constituted the waters beyond said bulkhead line navigable waters, and though the federal government established a pierhead line further west in the river, as the federal government did not attempt to provide regulations as to the building of piers, wharves, or docks within said space, the state government had a right to regulate the construction of docks, piers, and wharves between said bulkhead line and pierhead lines, and having by chapter 763 of the Laws of 1857 provided that no piers should be erected within 100 feet of another pier, and having by chapter 574 of the Laws of 1871, as supplemented and amended, authorized the city of New \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n York, through its officials, to adopt a plan for water front of the city of New York, including the erection of piers thereon, and the city having pursuant to said resolution adopted a plan requiring piers to be erected in Thirty-Ninth, Fortieth, and Forty-First streets, and said piers having been erected, thereby prevented the plaintiffs from erecting any pier, wharf, or other structure whatsoever upon their premises under water between the said bulkhead line established by the Secretary of War and Thirteenth avenue.\n\n'Section 33. The plaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction restraining the city of New York from using or authorizing the use by others of the plaintiffs' premises either within or without the federal bulkhead line, for the purpose of mooring, docking and floating boats.'\n\n The Court of Appeals, in its opinion (235 N. Y. 351, 139 N. E. 474), affirming the decree of the Appellate Division, after referring to the laws of 1857 and 1871 as the basis of the contention of the city that the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief, said:\n'When the Secretary of War established the bulkhead line, the title of the state, the city, and its grantees beyond such line was subordinated to such use of the submerged lands as should be required for the public right of navigation. No private property right requiring compensation was taken or destroyed by the establishment of such line. The owner's title was subject to the use which the United States might make of it. ... Plaintiffs have no authority to fill in any portion of their lands west of the bulkhead line. The city of New York, in the execution of its plans for the improvement of the water front westerly of such line for the purpose of navigation, invaded no right of plaintiffs.'\n\n The court said further that, if the plaintiffs' lots easterly of the bulkhead line had been actually filled in, they would no longer be lands under water, and would be completely subject to the plaintiffs' control, but that, so long as they remained unfilled and under water, they were subject to the sovereign power of the state and city to regulate the use of the water over them for purposes of navigation, and accordingly held that in respect to them the city had invaded no right of the plaintiffs. The opinion of the Court of Appeals indicates that previous decisions of the court contain dicta in respect to the jus publicum and jus privatum that cannot be sustained. \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 374]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

These questions we must answer independently of the conclusion of that court. Of course we should give all proper weight \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 380]\n\u00a0\n to its judgment, but we cannot perform our duty to enforce the guaranty of the federal Constitution as to the inviolability of contracts by state legislative action unless we give the questions independent consideration. It makes no difference what the answer to them involves, whether it turns on issues of general or purely local law, we cannot surrender the duty to exercise our own judgment. In the case before us, the construction and effect of the contract involved in the deeds and covenants depend chiefly upon the extent of the power of the state and city to part with property under navigable waters to private persons, free from subsequent regulatory control of the water over the land and the land itself. That is a state question, and we must determine it from the law of the state as it was when the deeds were executed to be derived from statutes then in force and from the decisions of the state court then and since made; but we must give our own judgment derived from such sources, and not accept the present conclusion of the state court without inquiry.\n Ordinarily this court must receive from the court of last resort of a state its statement of state law as final and conclusive, but the rule is different in a case like this.

Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1\n, 14 S. Ct. 548. The rights of the plaintiffs in error under the two deeds here in question with their covernants are to be determined then by the laws of New York as it was at the time of their execution and delivery. They were not deeds of gift; they were deeds for valuable consideration paid in money at the time, and a large amount of taxes on the lots have been collected from the plaintiffs by reason of their ownership. The principle applicable in the construction of grants of lands under navigable waters in the state of New York was announced by the Supreme Court of Errors in 1829 in Lansing v. Smith, 4 Wend. (N. Y.) 9, 21 Am. Dec. 89. In that case, which has always been regarded as a leading one, the commissioners of the Land Office in New York granted without valuable consideration to an upland owner land under water on which he erected a whart after filling in the same. Thereafter the Legislature authorized the erection of a mole or pier in the river for the purpose of constructing a basin for the safety and protection of canal boats, and this mole or pier entirely encompassed the wharf on the side of the water so as to leave no communication between it and the river except through a sloop lock at one extremity of the basin. It was held that the loss sustained by the owner was damnum absque injuria, that the grant only conveyed the land described in it by metes and bounds, and, being in derogation of the rights of the public nothing would be implied. \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 382]\n\u00a0\n Chancellor Walworth, speaking for the Court of Errors of the state, said:\n'By the common law, the king as parens patriae owned the soil under all the waters of all navigable rivers or arms of the sea where the tide regularly ebbs and flows, including the shore or bank to high- water mark. ... He held these rights, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of his subjects at large, who were entitled to the free use of the sea, and all tide waters, for the purposes of navigation, fishing, etc., subject to such regulations and restrictions as the crown or the Parliament might prescribe. By Magna Charta, and many subsequent statutes, the powers of the king are limited, and he cannot now deprive his subjects of these rights by granting the public navigable waters to individuals. But there can be no doubt of the right of Parliament in England, or the Legislature of this state, to make such grants, when they do not interfere with the vested rights of particular individuals. The right to navigate the public waters of the state and to fish therein, and the right to use the public highways, are all public rights belonging to the people at large. They are not the private unalienable rights of each individual. Hence the Legislature as the representatives of the public may restrict and regulate the exercise of those rights in such manner as may be deemed most beneficial to the public at large: Provided they do not interfere with vested rights which have been granted to individuals.'\n\n In the case of People v. New York & Staten Island Ferry Company, 68 N. Y. 71, the Court of Appeals, speaking of the common law, said (at page 77):\n'But while the sovereign can make no grant in derogation of the common right of passage over navigable waters, Parliament may do so . ... But a person claiming a special right in a navigable river or arm of the sea under a grant by Parliament, as, for example, a right to obstruct it, or to interfere in any way with the public easement, \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 383]\n\u00a0\n must show a clear title. It will not be presumed that the Legislature intended to destroy or abridge the public right for private benefit, and words of doubtful or equivocal import will not work this consequence. ... (At page 78:) The state, in place of the crown, holds the title, as trustee of a public trust, but the Legislature may, as the representative of the people, grant the soil, or confer an exclusive privilege in tidewaters, or authorize a use inconsistent with the public right, subject to the paramount control of Congress, through laws passed, in pursuance of the power to regulate commerce, given by the federal Constitution.'\n\n In that case the question involved the effect of a legislative grant of lands under water, so far as appears without valuable consideration, by the land commission of the state in 1818 to one John Gore on the eastern shore of Staten Island, including the premises thereafter acquired by the New York & Staten Island Ferry Company. The grant extended from low-water mark into the bay a distance of 500 feet, to have and to hold to Gore, his heirs and assigns, as a good and indefeasible estate of inheritance forever, under a statute authorizing the grant of such lands as the commissioners should 'deem necessary to promote the commerce of the state.' It was held that, as there was nothing to show that it was intended to restrict the state in the preservation of the navigation of the river in that 500 feet the grant to Gore might be and was restricted by the subsequent statute of 1857 of the state of New York, providing that it should not be lawful to fill in the land granted with earth or other solid material beyond the bulkhead line established under that law, or by piers that should exceed 70 feet in width, with intervening water spaces of at least 100 feet between them. It was therefore decided that the erection of a clubhouse on the land granted was a purpresture.\n It is apparent from these decisions that, under the law of New York when these cases were decided, whenever \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 384]\n\u00a0\n the Legislature deemed it to be in the public interest to grant a deed in fee simple to land under tidal waters and exclude itself from its exercise as sovereign of the jus publicum (that is, the power to preserve and regulate navigation), it might do so, but that the conclusion that it had thus excluded the jus publicum could only be reached upon clear evidence of its intention and of the public interest in promotion of which it acted.\n What is thus declared as the law of New York in these two cases, where it was found that the jus publicum had not been conveyed, is shown in a number of cases in the Court of Appeals, in which the state and its agency, the city, did part with the jus publicum to private owners of land under tidal water, and of wharfage rights thereon, upon adequate compensation and in pursuance of a plan of harbor improvement for the public interest.\n In the cases of Duryea v. Mayor, 62 N. Y. 592, and Duryee v. Mayor, 96 N. Y. 477, a deed of land under tidal water by the city of New York, with the authority of the state, conferred upon the grantees a fee-simple title with all the privileges of an absolute owner, except as restricted by the covenants and reservations contained in it. The covenants related to the filling of the streets running through the lots, which were excepted from the grant. The grantees had partially filled the water lots, and while this was being done the city with a sewer had flowed the land with the contents of the sewer. The sewer had been placed under a revocable license of the owner, but when the license was withdrawn the city insisted on continuing to use the lots for sewer discharge, and this it was held the city could not do.\n In the later case, in 1884, the Court of Appeals, speaking of the deed, said at page 497:\n'As we have before seen, the deed conferred upon the grantees therein the title and absolute ownership of the property conveyed, subject only to be defeated at the option of the grantor for a breach of the condition subsequent. \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 385]\n\u00a0\n The claim now made, that there was some right or interest in the property which still remained in the city notwithstanding its deed, is opposed to the principles declared in our former decision, and the express language of the conveyance.'\n\n In Towle v. Remsen, 70 N. Y. 303, 308, the Court of Appeals, in dealing with the effect of a deed of New York City of land under tidal waters, said:\n'The land under water originally belonged to the crown of Great Britain, and passed by the Revolution to the state of New York. The portion between high and low water mark, known as the tideway, was granted to the city by the early charters (Dongan Charter,  3 and 14; Montgomerie Charter,  37), and the corporation have an absolute fee in the same (Nott v. Thayer, 2 Bosw. 61). It necessarily follows that the city had a perfect right, when it granted to the devisees of Clarke, to make the grant of their portion of the land in fee-simple absolute. As to the land outside of the tideway, the city took title under chapter 115 of the Laws of 1807, with a proviso giving the pre- emptive right to the owners of the adjacent land in all grants made by the corporation of lands under water granted by said act. ... The Legislature left it to the city to dispose of the interests mentioned upon the proviso referred to; but it enacted no condition that it should not dispose of that which it owned in fee simple upon such terms as it deemed proper, and in the absence of any such enactment such a condition cannot be implied.'\n\n A deed of this class came before the Court of Appeals in Langdon v. Mayor, 93 N. Y. 129. The state commissioners of the land office, under a law of 1807, granted to the city a strip of land under water in the North River, the westerly line of which was in the river 400 feet west of the low-water mark. The city laid out an extension of West street along this strip, parallel with the river; the \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 386]\n\u00a0\n westerly line of the street being about 200 feet out in the river west of low-water mark. In 1810 the city granted to Astor, the owner of the adjoining uplands, certain lands under water, including a portion of the strip, the westerly bounds of the grant being 'the permanent line of West street, saving and reserving so much of the same as will be necessary to make West street in accordance with the map or plan.' In consideration of the grant the grantee covenanted to pay certain perpetual rents, to make such wharves as should be necessary to make the portion of West street, within the bounds of the grant, of the width specified, and forever thereafter to maintain and keep them in repair. The city covenated that the grantee should at all times thereafter have the wharfage, from the wharf or wharves to be erected on the west end of the premises granted. Astor constructed West street across the land granted, in accordance with his covenant, and maintained the wharf on the westerly line of said street. Without making compensation to the plaintiff, who succeeded to his title, the city erected a bulkhead outshore from such westerly line and filled up the space between it and the old bulkhead and destroyed the use of the wharf. It was contended that the city and state could not part with the power to preserve and regulate navigation in the water between the wharf and the 200 feet beyond owned by the city. The Court of Appeals held that the covenant as to the wharf which the city made to Astor in the deed was a grant of an incorporeal hereditament of wharfage, which the city or state could not impair; that the city acquired by its grant from the state the right to fill up the land granted, to build wharves thereon, and to receive wharfage; that whatever property rights it thus acquired it could convey to individuals; that by its grant to Astor the city conveyed, not only the land, excepting the part covered by West street, but also the right of wharfage; that an \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 387]\n\u00a0\n easement (i. e., a perpetual right of free access to the wharf across West street over the land of the city) therein passed by necessary implication; that the city had the right to grant such easement; that the Legislature could not by the act in question authorize a destruction or impairment of this easement without compensation to the owner; and that therefore the action for damages was maintainable.\n In the course of his opinion for the court, Judge Earl, speaking of the power of the city conferred upon it by the state, said (at page 144):\n'Here, taking the language of the charters and grants, the course of legislation, and all the statutes in pari materia, the situation of the lands granted and the use to which many portions of them had, with the knowledge and consent of the Legislature, been from time to time devoted, it is very clear that the lands under water around the city were conveyed to it in fee, to enable it to fill them up as the interest of the city might require, and to regulate and control the wharves and wharfage. We think it equally clear that whatever title and property rights the city thus obtained it could transfer and convey to individuals. Having the power to extend the ripa around the city, and thus make dry land, it could authorize any individual to do it. Whatever wharves and docks it could build, it could authorize individuals to build; and whatever wharfage it could take, it could authorize individuals to take. Its dominion over the lands under water, certainly for the purposes indicated in the preamble contained in section 15 above cited, was complete.'\n\n Speaking of the wharfage granted the judge said (at page 152):\n'An easement for access to the wharf over the adjacent land of the city under water passed by necessary implication. Without the easement the wharf would be of no \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 388]\n\u00a0\n use, there could be no wharfage, and the grant as to the wharf and wharfage would be futile. The grant was made for an adequate valuable consideration. It was not made solely or primarily for the benefit of the grantee, but primarily for the benefit of the city, in pursuance of a policy for improving its harbor and furnishing its treasury. Under such circumstances there is no rule of construction which can confine the grant to the metes and bounds mentioned in the deed. If the city had owned this wharf and granted it, the right to wharfage and an easement for access to the wharf over the adjacent land of the city under water would have passed by necessary implication as incidents and appurtenances of the thing granted. ... So it would seem that a grant of the right to build and forever maintain a wharf upon the land of the city would upon the same principle carry with it the right to take the wharfage and have access to the wharf. In addition to the right to build and maintain the wharf, however, here there was on the part of the city an express grant of the wharfage, and it must have been the intention of the parties that the grantee should have open water in front of his wharf for the accommodation of vessels that the wharfage which was granted to him might be earned.'\n\n The necessary effect of the Langdon Case, which has always been a leading authority in the state of New York, is that a grant upon a valuable consideration of the easement of wharfage related to land under water conveyed by the city by authority of the state, for the purpose of promoting commerce and the harbor of the city, taken away from the city and state the power to regulate navigation in any way which would interfere with or obstruct the grant, and that, if the city desired in the interest of navigation to obstruct such easement, it must acquire it by condemnation. If it may do this, it follows necessarily that it may by an absolute deed of land under \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 389]\n\u00a0\n water, with the right of the grantee to fill it, part with its own power to regulate the navigation of water over this land which would interfere with its ownership and enjoyment by the grantee.\n The Langdon Case was approved and followed in the case of Williams v. City of New York, 105 N. U. 419, 11 N. Ed. 829. In that case, the city under New York laws of 1813 and 1857 was held to have received authority from the state to fill in the east side of the Hudson River from an existing bulkhead to Thirteenth avenue with a new bulkhead there. The city made a grant to a private person of the land under water some 80 feet, with a requirement that he fill it in and build the new bulkhead with wharfage on the outer bulkhead. It was held that he took a fee, that he had an easement for the approach of vessels in its front, and that the property thus granted him could not be taken by the city for the public use without compensation. The court said in that case:\n'The authority thus given being commensurate with the municipal limits, involved a grant of so much of the land of the state under water as those wharves would occupy if the city's choice of location required such appropriation. This right was tantamount to an ownership. It embraced the entire beneficial interest, and was inconsistent with any title remaining in the state. The wharf when built completely occupied the land under water, and might be built, if need be, of stone and earth. All use for the floating of vessels disappeared, so far as it occupied the water. The new and substituted use created by the city or its grantees belonged wholly to them, for the entire benefit, in the form of shippage, wharfage, and cranage, was given to them. There was never any restraint put upon this general grant, and the ownership involved, where the plans carried the wharves on to the state's land in the stream, except the limitation of exterior lines beyond which the authority should not go, \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 390]\n\u00a0\n or that imposed by general plans agreed upon by both parties. ...\n\n'So that, when the state granted to the city wharf rights which might extend into the deep water covering its own land, it granted two things: Property in the land covered by the wharf and occupied by it, and an easement for approach of vessels in its front. That easement the state by its own sole action could not take away or destroy without awarding adequate compensation.'\n\n The same principle was announced in Mayor v. Law, 125 N. Y. 380, 26 N. E. 471.\n In People v. Steeplechase Park Co., 218 N. Y. 459, 113 N. E. 521, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 1099, it was held that where the state, through its land commissioners, unqualifiedly granted to defendants lands in navigable waters between high and low water marks, the exclusive use and right of possession vested in the grantee. Hogan, Cardozo, and Seabury, Judges, dissented. The ruling went to the extent of deciding that fences, barriers, platforms, pavilions, and other structures of a private amusement park constructed by the grantee on lands under navigable water between high and low water mark, although an interference with the public use of and access to such lands, could not be enjoined where the grant of such lands was unqualified.\n In that case at pages 479, 480 (113 N. E. 526), the court said:\n'During all our history the Legislature and the courts have recognized that the public interest may require or at least justify a limited restriction of the boundaries of navigable waters. The public interest may require the building of docks and piers to facilitate approach to the channel of such navigable waters. The beneficial enjoyment of land adjoining the channel of public waters may require or at least justify the conveyance of lands below high water on which to erect buildings. As in England the crown and Parliament can without limitation convey land under public waters, so in this state land under \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 391]\n\u00a0\n water below high-water mark can be conveyed by the Legislature, or in accordance with constitutional and legislative direction. Where the state has conveyed lands without restriction, intending to grant a fee therein for beneficial enjoyment, the title of the grantee, except as against the rights of riparian or littoral owners, is absolute, and unless the grant is attacked for some reason recognized as a ground for attack by the courts, or the use thereof is prevented by the federal government, there is no authority for an injunction against its legitimate use.'\n\n The Duryea and the Langdon Cases rest on the delegation by the state to the city of the state's sovereign right to control navigation or the jus publicum in the land to be disposed of by the city to private owners in pursuit of the promotion of filling land under water to a ripa or exterior line, and of the construction of docks to make a harbor. The rights of such private owners come, not from riparian rights, or gratuitous statutory grants. They come from a deed absolute of the lots conveyed for a money consideration. The Steeplechase Park Case was a close case, as shown by the dissents, and was not nearly so strong a one for the application of the principle above stated as the case at bar, or the Duryea and Langdon Cases.\n If we are right in our conclusion as to the effect of these deeds under the law of New York at the time of their execution, then there can be no doubt that the laws of 1857 and 1871 as enforced in this case impair the contract made by the city with the grantees of these deeds.\n Cases cited as contrary to the New York City water lot decisions just considered must be examined, to see whether they involve grants of lots under tidewater by deed absolute in fee simple from the city or state, in consideration of money paid and in promotion of harbor plans or other public purposes.\n Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Forty-Second, etc., R. Co., 176 N. Y. 408, 68 N. E. 864, is relied on to show a conclusion adverse to the infer- \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 392]\n\u00a0\n ences we have drawn as to the New York law. There the Court of Appeals sustained an order denying an injunction to restrain the city from effecting an extension of Forty-Third street into the Hudson river, sought by one who by deed of the city was given the right to wharfage at the end of Forty-Third street. In the same deed land under water on each side of the street was conveyed to the grantee in fee simple. The court held that the street was held in trust by the city for the public use, and that the grant of wharfage at the end of the street did not carry the fee in the street, but only an easement of wharfage at the end of the street, as the city might extend it into the river, and that, by virtue of covenant in the deed, the grantee, if he would enjoy the wharfage, must erect a new wharf or pier at the new end of the extended street. The grant was not of the fee, but only of an ambulatory easement of wharfage on any extension of the street. But the city was nevertheless thereafter required to condemn this grant of the easement. American Ice Co. v. City of New York, 193 N. Y. 673, 87 N. E. 765, and 217 N. Y. 402, 112 N. E. 170.\n The case of Sage v. Mayor, 154 N. Y. 61, 79, 47 N. E. 1096, 38 L. R. A. 606, 61 Am. St. Rep. 592, does not conflict in any way with the Langdon and other cases. That only concerned the right of a riparian owner in the tideway which the city owned and deeded to another. It was held that the riparian owner had no more right to complain of the city's disposition of the tideway for the public interest by deed than had the owner of a United States Patent reaching to high-water mark to complain of the state's disposition of the tideway in Oregon in Shively v. Bowlby, supra.\n The cases of Brookhaven v. Smith, 188 N. Y. 74, 80 N. E. 665, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 326, 11 Ann. Cas. 1, and Barnes v. Midiand R. R. Terminal Co., 193 N. Y. 378, 85 N. E. 1093, 127 Am. St. Rep. 962, concern conflicting rights of riparian owners and of persons with limited grants to put out a wharf without any feesimple title, and seem to us to have no bearing upon the question here. \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 393]\n\u00a0\n In Lewis Blue Point Co. v.

Cas. 694, grantees under deeds made before 1700 conveying the excusive right of fishing leased for 10 years the right to plant and cultivate oysters in the navigable waters of the Great South Bay, Long Island, the lessees were held subject to an act of Congress authorizing and directing the dredging of a channel 2,000 feet long and 200 feet wide through their oyster beds without claim for compensation. It was held that they had derived no more right in the fishery than the king had in his private ownership, and he could not convey the right to restrict navigation which he held in trust for the public. The colonial grant, therefore, which was not like a grant from the state, did not exclude the sovereign right to provide for navigation. Moreover, it was a federal right which the owners were opposing, and of course they had to yield. Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121\n, 39 S. Ct. 56; Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs, \n229 \nU.S. 82\n, 33 S. Ct. 679, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 232.\n It is urged, against our view of what these deeds conveyed of the sovereign power of the state and the ownership of the city at the time of their execution, that it is opposed to the judgment of this Court in Illinois Central R. Co. v. Illinois, \n146 \nU.S. 387\n, 13 S. Ct. 110, in which the validity of a grant by the Illinois Legislature to the Illinois Central Railroad Company of more than 1,000 acres in the harbor of Chicago in Lake Michigan was under consideration. It was more than three times the area of the outer harbor, and not only included all that harbor, but embraced the adjoining submerged lands which would in all probability be thereafter included in the harbor. It was held that it was not conceivable that a Legislature could divest the state of this absolutely in the interest of a private corporation, that it was a gross perversion of the trust over the property under which it was held, an abdication of sovereign governmental power, and that a grant of such right was invalid. The limitations on the \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 394]\n\u00a0\n doctrine were stated by Mr. Justice Field, who delivered the opinion, as follows, at page 452 (13 S. Ct. 118):\n'The interest of the people in the navigation of the waters and in commerce over them may be improved in many instances by the erection of wharves, docks, and piers therein, for which purpose the state may grant parcels of the submerged lands; and, so long as their disposition is made for such purpose, no valid objections can be made to the grants. It is grants of parcels of lands under navigable waters, that may afford foundation for wharves, piers, docks and other structures in aid of commerce, and grants of parcels which, being occupied, do not substantially impair the public interest in the lands and waters remaining, that are chiefly considered and sustained in the adjudged cases as a valid exercise of legislative power, consistently with the trust to the public upon which such lands are held by the state. But that is a very different doctrine from the one which would sanction the abdication of the general control of the state over lands under the navigable waters of an entire harbor or bay, or of a sea or lake. Such abdication is not consistent with the exercise of that trust which requires the government of the state to preserve such waters for the use of the public. The trust devolving upon the state for the public, and which can only be discharged by the management and control of property in which the public has an interest cannot be relinquished by a transfer of the property. The control of the state for the purposes of the trust can never be lost, except as to such parcels as are used in promoting the interests of the public therein, or can be disposed of without any substantial impairment of the public interest in the lands and waters remaining. It is only be observing the distinction between a grant of such parcles for the improvement of the public interest, or which when occupied do not substantially impair the public interest in the lands and waters remaining, and a grant \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 395]\n\u00a0\n of the whole property in which the public is interested, that the language of the adjudged cases can be reconciled.'\n\n That case arose in the Circuit Court of the United States, and the conclusion reached was necessarily a statement of Illinois law, but the general principle and the exception have been recognized the country over and have been approved in several cases in the state of New York.\n In Coxe v. State, 144 N. Y. 396, 39 N. E. 400, a company was created to reclaim and drain all or any portion of the wet or overflowed lands and tidewater marshes on or adjacent to Staten Island and Long Island, except such portions of the same as were included within the corporate limits of any city, upon the deposit of $25,000 and the payment to the state of a sum to be fixed by a commission after doing the work. This was a suit to recover a $25,000 deposit because the Attorney General had decided the law to be unconstitutional. The court followed the Illinois Central Railroad Case, and held the law invalid, but said:\n'For every purpose which may be useful, convenient, or necessary to the public, the state has the unquestionable right to make grants in fee or conditionally for the beneficial use of the grantee, or to promote commerce according to their terms. The extensive grant to the city of New York of the lands under water below the shore line around Manhattan Island clearly comes within this principle, since it was a grant to a municipality, constituting a political division of the state, for the promotion of the commercial prosperity of the city, and consequently of the people of the state'-citing Langdon v. Mayor, 93 N. Y. 129.\n\n The opinion says:\n'The title which the state holds and the power of disposition is an includent and part of its sovereignty, that cannot be surrendered, alienated, or delegated, except for some public purpose, or some reasonable use which can fairly be said to be for the public benefit.' \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 396]\n\u00a0\n The same rule and exception are laid down in Long Sault Development Co. v. Kennedy, 212 N. Y. 1, 105 N. E. 849, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 56, where the Legislature of New York attempted to give complete control of the navigation of the St. Lawrence river in the region of Long Sault Rapids, to a private corporation and abdicate its sovereign function. The court held the grant invalid, but said in stating the exception:\n\n'The power of the Legislature to grant land under navigable waters to private persons or corporations for beneficial enjoyment has been exercised too long and has been affirmed by this court too often to be open to serious question at this late day'\n\n -citing Lansing v. Smith, supra; People v. New York & Staten Island Ferry Company, supra; and Langdon v. Mayor, supra; and added:\n ... The contemplated use, however, must be reasonable and one which can fairly be said to be for the public benefit or not injurious to the public.'\n There is an interesting discussion of the same exception by Chief Justice Bartlett in People v. Steeplechase Park, supra, at page 482 (113 N. E. 521), in which he cites United States v. Mission Rock Co., \n189 \nU.S. 391, 406\n, 23 S. Ct. 606, and emphasizes the distinction between the Illinois Central, the Coxe, and Long Sault Cases and grants like those we are considering. It is clear that the ruling in those cases has no application here.\n But it is said, and the court below held, that the fee simple granted by the deeds in this case did not exclude the right of the city to regulate and preserve navigation over the waters covering the land conveyed until they were filled, and that this distinguishes the Duryea, Langdon, and other cases, in which the filling had taken place, from the present one.\n The suggestion that rights of ownership in lands under water, conveyed by the city by such a deed in fee simple, \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 397]\n\u00a0\n are restricted, and the city's control of navigation of the water over them remains complete until they are filled, cannot be accepted without qualification in respect to grants which are intended to part both with the jus publicum and jus privatum, as we have found these deeds to do. The suggestion does not find support in the case of First Construction Co. of Brooklyn v. State, 221 N. Y. 295, 116 N. E. 1020, cited to sustain it. In that case, Beard was an upland owner whose land bordered on Gowanus Bay. The Legislature in three acts granted to a private person the right to build wharves and fill in lands in a salt meadow marsh and mud flats partially submerged at high tides. The court (Hiscock, C. J.), in stating the case, said:\n'It may be stated generally that none of them (the legislative acts) did more than grant to Beard and others the privilege to build wharves, etc., and fill in lands; none of them purported in terms to grant and convey the title to lands under water included with him the area now appropriated, and none of them was passed by a two-thirds vote.'\n\n It was held that no title could pass, because it was a gratuity, and no grant could be made under the Constitution without a two-thirds vote of the Legislature, which was not here, and that it was only a privilege or franchise, which could not ripen into a title until the land was filled. It does not bear on the case here, except in the necessary inference, from the treatment of the matter in the opinion, that, if title had passed, filling was not necessary to vest full fee simple in the grantee.\n Of course we do not intend to say that under such deeds as these, as long as water connected with the river remains over the land conveyed and to be filled, navigation may not go on and boats may not ply over it, and that incident to such use occasional mooring may not take place. But it is a very different thing to say that \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 398]\n\u00a0\n the city, which has parted with the jus publicum and jus privatum over such water lots, remains in unrestricted control of navigation, with the right to dredge them, or appropriate the water over them as a slip or regular mooring place for its adjoining piers, in the doing of a great business, largely excluding plaintiffs and all others from use of the water over those lots for the constant private use of the city's tenants for its profit. This distinction and conclusion is borne out by the decision of the Court of Appeals in Re Mayor of the City, 193 N. Y. 503, 87 N. E. 759, where the court was dealing with the question of the elements of value of a pier right in the Hudson river, granted by the city to an individual in a deed with covenants quite like those in this case when the pier adjoined an unfilled water lot of the city. The court said:\n'The deed of the pier right cannot be construed as conferring any right of access from or over the lands which the city might at its pleasure cause to be filled in. It is obvious, of course, that so long as this territory was not filled in it served the purposes of access to the pier, but that was merely a privilege by sufferance and not a legal right.'\n\n The evidence shows that two slips between the city piers at Thirty- Ninth street and Fortieth street, and those between Fortieth street and Forty-First street are usually blocked with coal barges, with railroad floats carrying box cars on them, with cattle boats using a runway for cattle at the side of the piers, and all are being moored in the slips for the use and benefit of the lessees and other tenants of the city for the pecuniary profit of the city. This and the dredging of the soil of the plaintiffs certainly are more than a privilege of sufferance. Whittaker v. Burhans, 62 Barb. (N. Y.) 237; Wall v. Pittsburgh Harbor Co., 152 Pa. 427, 25 A. 647, 34 Am. St. Rep. 667.\n The wharfage rights of the city at the piers in Thirty-Ninth, Fortieth, and Forty-First streets as far at Thirteenth avenue under the deeds before us cover only the ends of those piers and not \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 399]\n\u00a0\n their sides. This is clear, because the grantees of the deeds were vested with the wharfage on Thirteenth avenue along the river extending from Thirty-Ninth street to Forty-First street, except that at the ends of the cross streets. In this state of the case, the rights of the city, having parted with the sovereign regulation of navigation in the water over these lots, are not different from those of the owner of the upland, who builds out his pier to deep water. His right is limited to the front or end of the pier for his private use.\n Judge Cullen, in Jenks v. Miller, 14 App. Div. 480, 43 N. Y. S. 932, points out that:\n'Though the owner of adjacent upland has the right of access to the river and also the right to construct a proper pier therein, he has no easement or interest in the lands under water in front of the adjacent proprietors. The riparian right of access, so far as it is a proper right incident to the ownership of the upland, is strictly a right of access by the front.'\n\n The same principle is approved in Consumers' Coal & Ice Company v. City of New York, 181 App. Div. 388, 394, 169 N. Y. S. 92, where it said that privately owned land under public waters is subject to the navigation of vessels over it, but cannot be appropriated by others to enlarge the berths at private piers. Compare Keyport Steamboat Co. v. Transportation Co., 18 N. J. Eq. 511, 515; United States v. Bain, 24 Fed. Cas. 940, No. 14,496.\n Our conclusions are that Appleby and Latou were vested with the fee- simple title in the lots conveyed, and, with a grant of the wharfage at the ends of the lots on the river, that with respect to the water over those lots and the wharfage the state and the city had parted with the jus publicum and the jus privatum, and that the city can only be revested with that by a condemnation of the rights granted.\n What, then, is the effect upon the rights of the parties of the fact that the grantees only filled the part of lots \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 400]\n\u00a0\n conveyed east of Twelfth avenue? The plaintiffs are not in default in this because there was no covenant on their part to fill. Duryea v. Mayor, supra, at page 596; Id., 96 N. Y. 477, 496; Mayor v. Law, supra, at page 391 (26 N. E. 471). The filling was left to their convenience. They were not in default with reference to filling in the streets and avenues, because their covenant to do so was only on condition that the city should require it, and only when it did so. The reason for their delay in filling the remainder of the lot beyond Twelfth avenue was doubtless due to the passage of the act of 1857 and of the act of 1871, and their reasonable expectation that the city would condemn their rights, and expectation that was confirmed by the condemnation proceeding which was directed to be begun in 1890 by the dock commission, and was begun in 1894, and remained without prosecution, and operated as a dead hand upon this property for 20 years, until 1914, when the city discontinued it. Thereupon this suit was promptly brought.\n The rights of the plaintiff with reference to the use of the water over their lots lying between the bulkhead line and Twelfth avenue are not affected by the order of the Secretary of War. The evidence shows that for 100 feet or more inside the line the water over these lots is made part of the slip and city mooring place for the city's pier; that in order to adapt it to such a purpose the soil in the lots is being constantly dredged, the dredging having increased the depth of the water from 3 feet to 16 and 20 feet. This has been done by the city on the assumption that, because it is water connected with the river, the city may improve its navigation. As the city has parted with the jus publicum in respect to these lots, it may not exercise this power, and must be content with sailing over it with boats as it finds it. The dredging of the mud in those lots to a depth of 15 feet is a trespass upon the plaintiffs' rights. They have a right at \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 401]\n\u00a0\n their convenience to fill both lots from the bulkhead line easterly to Twelfth avenue and beyond. And we know from a record in a related case, argued with this and to be decided this day (\n271 \nU.S. 403\n, 46 S. Ct. 581), that they have applied for permission to fill the lots and are pressing their right to do so. So, too, the use of the water over these lots inside the bulkhead line for mooring places, berths, or slips by the city and its tenants, as we have shown, violates the rights of the plaintiffs. They are entitled to an injunction against both.\n The order of the Secretary of War of 1890 fixing the bulkhead line 150 feet west of Twelfth avenue, and allowing pier extensions far beyond Thirteenth avenue, to 700 feet from the bulkhead line, does not take away the right of the plaintiffs to object to the city's dredging their lots, or to its using the water over their lots for what is in effect an exclusive slip and mooring place. The order did not restore to the city the power as against these plaintiffs to regulate navigation over their lots, and so did not make the act of 1857 and the act of 1871 with respect to the spacing of 100 feet between piers and for mooring places adjoining the piers effective to defeat those deeds. The action of the city in making these deeds and covenants was, of course, subject to the dominant right of the government of the United States to control navigation; but the exercise of that dominant right did not revest in the city a control and proprietary right which it had parted with by solemn deed and covenant to these plaintiffs.\n The only just and possible result of the Secretary of War's order is that the enjoyment by the plaintiffs of their rights under the deeds is qualified to the extent of a compliance with it without conferring any affirmative power upon the city to detract from the rights which it had granted. The plaintiffs are prevented from solidly filling between the buikhead line and Thirteenth avenue, but the order expressly authorizes the substitution for such \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 402]\n\u00a0\n filling of the construction of piers on piling driven into the lots of the plaintiffs. To whom is given the right to build piers over these lots? The government does not attempt to take it away from the owners of the lots. It does not attempt to vest it in the city. It could not do so if it would. The right must reside in those who have the ownership of the land under the water and who until the Secretary had made his order were entitled by their grants to use the solid filling up to the line of Thirteenth avenue, without reference to the bulkhead lines or to the 100 feet spacing between the piers under the acts of 1857 or 1871\n\n\n The lots have been bought and paid for, subject only to control by the general government in the interest of navigation. The general government, through its agent, says it does not require open water for navigation, but is sufficiently satisfied by piers on piles extending over the water. The city has by deed granted to the Applebys the wharfage and cranage rights upon these lots. What is there to prevent the Applebys, by the construction of piers on piles over their lots, in conformity to the Secretary of War's order, from enjoying the profit from that wharfage?\n It thus is seen that the limitations on the right of the city to use the water over the lots outshore from the bulkhead line are no different from what they are inshore of the bulkhead line. The right of the city in respect to the use of the water over the lots beyond the bulkhead line is, as is said in Re Mayor of the City, supra, already quoted, merely a privilege by sufferance, and not a legal right, and lasts only until these lots may be covered by piers on piles, as allowed by the Secretary of War.\n The plaintiffs are therefore entitled also to an injunction to prevent the dredging of their lots by the city from the bulkhead line to Thirteenth avenue, and also to prevent the continued use of the water over their lots in that same \n\n[271 U.S. 364, 403]\n\u00a0\n extent as a slip or permanent mooring place for the adjoining piers of the city. They are also entitled to a specific injunction against the overhanging platform which was put out by the city for its tenants on the north side of the Thirty-Ninth street pier.\n The application of the acts of 1857 and 1871 by the courts of New York would reduce the rights which were intended to be conveyed in these deeds to practically nothing, and would leave the grantees only the privilege of paying taxes for something quite unsubstantial. The qualification of those rights by the order of the Secretary of War still leaves value in the deeds, if the acts of 1857 and 1871 are invalid, as we hold them to be when applied as they have been in this case.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of New York is reversed for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Shaded as herewith published. \n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAPPLEBY v.

Ct. 569. The petition of the Applebys, as relators in this case, shows that they have performed all the covenants they had to perform under the deeds; that neither they nor their predecessors in title had ever been required to build or erect piers, wharves, or bulkheads, referred to in the deeds; that under the act of 1871 a department of docks was created, with general supervision and control of the dock property of the city; that it was given authority, with the approval of the sinking fund trustees or the city, to make a plan or plans for the improvement of the harbor, to lay out wharves, and to condemn such vested \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n property interests of individuals as might interfere with such plans and make compensation therefor; that in June, 1891, the city instituted a condemnation proceeding to acquire the Appleby property, but that is 1914 it discontinued it, and since that has never attempted to acquire title to the premises; that a plan was adopted in 1916 by the dock commission for harbor improvement, with the approval of the sinking fund trustees, for a marginal wharf to be 250 feet wide, to include all of Twelfth avenue, and so much of the Appleby property as lay west of Twelfth avenue, and within a distance of 100 feet westerly therefrom, which would interfere with relators filling their lots; that in December, 1919, the Applebys made application to the commissioner of docks to begin and continue the filling of the two lots of the Applebys within the government bulkhead line as permitted by their deeds; that the commissioner of docks, in answer to this application, wrote as follows:\n'January 31, 1920\n\n\n\n'Replying to your letter of the 26th instant, I beg to advise you that the application of Edgar S. Appleby and John S. Appleby for permission to construct either a platform between West Thirty-Ninth and West Forty-First streets, North River, or a concrete wall on platform construction, with sheet piling along the inner side to retain filling, is hereby formally denied, on account of the fact that the proposed construction is not in accordance with the new plan.'\n\n Thereupon this suit was brought by the Applebys against the dock commissioner to compel the issuing of the necessary permit. This was denied by the Supreme Court in Special Term. The denial was reversed in the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, and that reversal was in turn reversed by the Court of Appeals in an opinion as follows:\n'Relators seek to compel the commissioner of docks to approve permits for the filling in of lands under water. \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n 'The facts herein are substantially the same as in Appleby v. City of New York, decided herewith, with this difference: The city established a new bulkhead line in 1916, which crosses the premises granted between Twelfth and Thirteenth avenues. It was held in the action that the rights of the relators are not limited by this bulkhead line, but only by the bulkhead line established by the Secretary of War. The court below decided herein that a writ of peremptory mandamus should issue unless condemnation proceedings were instituted to acquire relators' property, and property rights within such line. 199 App. Div. 552, 192 N. Y. S. 222.\n\n'We held in the action that the title of relators to lands actually under water is subject to the rights of the city to improve the same for the purposes of navigation, but that the city must reacquire the property rights in the land under water which it has conveyed before it can carry out its plans for such improvement.\n\n'This application should not, however, be granted. Section 15 of title 4 of the sinking fund ordinance of 1844, referred to in the opinion in the action, provides: 'No grant made by virtue of this ordinance shall authorize the grantee to construct bulkheads or piers or make land in conformity therewith, without permission to do so is first had and obtained from the common council.'\n\n'The water grants under which relators hold title also provide: 'And it is hereby further covenanted and agreed, by and between the parties to these presents, and the true intent and meaning hereof is, that the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, will not build the said wharves, bulkheads, avenues, or streets hereinbefore mentioned or any part thereof, or make the lands in conformity with the covenants hereinafter mentioned until permission for that purpose shall be first had and obtained \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n from the said parties of the first part, or their successors, and will not build or erect or cause to be built or erected any wharf or pier or other obstruction in the Hudson river in front of the hereby granted premises without the permission of the said parties of the first part or their successors or assigns first had for that purpose.'\n\n'In Duryea v. Mayor, etc., of City of New York, 62 N. Y. 592, it was said that a similar clause did not limit the right of the owners to fill the space between the streets, but on a subsequent appeal (Duryee v. Mayor, etc., of City of New York, 96 N. Y. 477), it was said that the provisions of the sinking fund ordinance had not been called to the court's attention on the first appeal, and it was held that the council had given its consent. We are free to interpret the clause according to its meaning. To construe the ordinance and the grants as permitting the filling of the land between the streets at the will of the grantee, and as prohibiting the building of the wharves and streets without the consent of the common council, would be unreasonable. ... The lands are thus held subject to the conditions of the grant, and may not be filled in without the approval of the city authorities. The power to grant permission to construct bulkheads or piers and to make land in conformity with relators' grants implies the right to withhold such permission.'\n\n The sinking fund ordinance, referred to in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, does not appear in the record. The Court of Appeals, however, took judicial notice of it, and the following statement with respect to it is taken from the opinion of that court in the case of Duryee v. Mayor, 96 N. Y. 477, 485, 486:\n'These ordinances adopted in 1884 provide, among other things, that the lands under water on the shores of the island of New York, belonging to that city under its several charters, might be sold and conveyed by such city to parties desiring to purchase the same, giving priority to the owner of the adjacent uplands upon certain terms and conditions therein mentioned.'\n\n Section 15 reads: \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n 'No grant made by virtue of this ordinance shall authorize the grantee to construct bulkheads or piers or make land in conformity thereto without permission so to do is first had and obtained from the common council, and the grantee shall be bound to make such lands, piers and bulkheads at such times and in such manner as the common council shall direct under penalty of forfeiture of such grant for noncompliance with such terms of the common council.\n'These ordinances were recognized and approved by the state Legislature in chapter 225 of the Laws of 1845, and were attempted thereby to be placed beyond the power of the local authorities of the city of limit or amend without the previous consent of the Legislature.'\n\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, Charles Henry Butler, of Washington, D. C., and Banton Moore, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Charles J. Nehrbas and George P. Nicholson, both of New York City, for defendant in error. \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The relators base their writ upon the alleged impairment of their contract rights contained in the grant and covenants of their deeds by the plan adopted in 1916 under the act of 1871 (Laws 1871, c. 574) by the dock department, and approved by the sinking fund trustees, the execution of which the dock commissioner is enforcing by a formal refusal to grant permission as requested by the relators to fill up their lots. The authority of the dock commissioner and the sinking fund trustees under the act of 1871 is such as to make the plan and the refusal equivalent to a statute of the state, and, assuming that it is in conflict with the grant and covenants of relators' deeds, it is a law of the state impairing a contract obligation, under section 10, article 1, of the federal Constitution. New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., \n125 \nU.S. 18\n, 8 S. Ct. 741; Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, 183; Walla Walla City v.

We have jurisdiction of the writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n The question in this case then is whether the deeds before us, construed in connection with the sinking fund ordinance of 1844, gave to the plaintiffs the right to fill in the lots without the consent of the city. Each deed described the land conveyed as follows:\n'All that certain water lot or vacant ground and soil under water to be made land and gained out of the Hudson or North River or harbor of New York, and bounded, etc., together with all \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n and singular the privileges, advantages, hereditaments and appurtenances to the same belonging or in any wise appertaining.'\n\n The grants were in fee simple. The grantees respectively covenanted that they would, upon the request of the city, build bulkheads, wharves, streets, and avenues to form part of Twelfth and Thirteenth avenues, and Thirty-Ninth, Fortieth, an Forty-First streets, which were within the general description of the premises conveyed. These were excepted therefrom for public streets. The grantees agreed to pay the taxes on the lots lying between the streets. There was a covenant that they would not build the wharves, bulkheads, avenues, or streets previously mentioned until permission had been given by the city. The city covenanted that the grantees might have wharfage on the westerly side of the granted premises fronting on the Hudson river, excepting at the westerly ends of the cross streets, which was reserved for the city.\n In a deed of a similar water lot on the east side of the city, with exactly the same covenants, the question arose in the case of Duryea v. Mayor, etc., 62 N. Y. 592, 596, whether the covenants with respect to filling the streets applied to the filling of the water lots between the streets, and it was held that they did not. The court said, at page 596:\n'The only covenant in the deed for making lands applies exclusively to the building of streets, wharves, etc., and there is not a word pertaining to the intermediate spaces.'\n\n In the same case reported in 96 N. Y. 477, the sinking fund ordinance, not referred to in the first decision, was pressed upon the court to change its conclusion in the first hearing and to hold that the city had the absolute right, by reason of the ordinance, to forbid the filling of the land conveyed. As to that the court said:\n'It may very well be doubted whether the construction formerly given by this court to the covenants contained in \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n the deed should not also be deemed applicable to the provision of the sinking fund ordinance. The object of this provision was not to cause any interest in the land conveyed to be retained by the grantor, or to postpone the period of enjoyment of its owners, or increase the security of the public creditors, but was obviously designed to enable the grantor to shield itself from the burden of caring for and maintaining the piers, wharves, and streets until such time as it should deem the assumption thereof profitable and expedient, and to fix the time and manner of erecting those structures with reference to the introduction therein of water, gas, sewer pipes, and other necessary conveniences which naturally fell under the supervision and control of the city authorities. The accomplishment of this object would in no way be materially interfered with by allowing the grantees to proceed with their contemplated work of redeeming their lands from the water and realizing the benefits, which were the sole inducement to them for its purchase.'\n\n It referred to the conduct of the city through all its departments for a period of upwards of 20 years in dealing with the ordinance and deeds like this as having affixed the interpretation claimed by the relators as the true intent and meaning of both. It said further:\n'The rule by which this ordinance is to be construed is such as applies to the interpretation of the acts of other legislative bodies, and is that which shall best effectuate the intent of its authors. The reason and object of an act are to be regarded to arrive at its meaning, and while it is not competent to interpret that which has no need of interpretation, or to deny to clear and precise terms the sense which they naturally present, yet, when such terms lead to manifest injustice and involve an absurdity, law and equity both require us to give such an effect to the language used as will accomplish the obvious intent of the Legislature. ...\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n 'The only lands expressly provided to be made by the ordinance are those constituting the piers, wharves, streets, and avenues, and since it is unnecessary in order to give the clause in question an office to perform, to extend it to lands outside of such streets, and to create a right unconnected with those clearly intended to be granted, it is in accordance with settled rules of interpretation to limit the effect of general language to the accomplishment of the object undoubtedly intended. ... If it be held that the words 'make land in conformity thereto,' as used in the ordinance, apply only to the lands necessary to form the piers, bulkheads, and streets, the defendant will not only be protected in all of the rights intended to be secured to it, but the grantee will receive the benefits of his purchase and the deed will be free from objection on account of the apparent repugnancy existing between the interest actually conveyed and those apparently reserved.\n'It is quite inconceivable that parties should purchase land burdened with the condition that it should be enjoyed only the the permission of the grantor, and a construction having that effect, should only be adopted when no other is possible or sustainable.'\n\n After giving this construction to the deed and ordinance, the court then examined the evidence, and found that the common council had by its conduct consented to the filling in of the lots, and because, in its summing up, the court referred to the latter ground, it is insisted that its chief discussion and conclusion upon the construction of the ordinance and deed are not to be treated as authority. It should be noted that the construction of the deed by the court in the Duryea Case upon this point was referred to approvingly as authority in Mayor v. Law, 125 N. Y. 380, 391, 26 N. E. 471, 472, where, citing the Duryea Case, the court used this language with respect to a similar covenant:\n'The grantee became the absolute owner of the land between the streets, the land granted, and (that) he \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n could properly fill up whenever he choose, suiting his own pleasure as to the time and manner of doing it, but there was nothing in the grant binding him to fill it up.'\n\n The Court of Appeals in the present case disposed of the question we are discussing as follows:\n'To construe the ordinance and the grants as permitting the filling of the land between the streets at the will of the grantee and prohibiting the building of the wharves and streets, without the consent of the common council, would be unreasonable.'\n\n We cannot agree with this. We think the reasons advanced by that court in the second Duryea Case to sustain the opposite construction of the deed and ordinance are much more persuasive. It has added force when it appears from the opinion in the Duryea Case and the conclusion of the Appellate Division in this case that such construction of such deeds and the ordinance has become a rule of property for more than 50 years. It is not reasonable to suppose that the grantees would pay $12,000 in 1852 and 1853, and leave to the city authorities the absolute right completely to nullify the chief consideration for seeking this property in making dry land, or that the parties then took that view of the transaction. In addition to the down payment, the grantees or their successors have paid the taxes assessed by the city for 75 years, which have evidently amounted to much more than $70,000. It does not seem fair to us, after these taxes have been paid for 60 years, in the confidence justified by the decision of the highest state court, that there was the full right to fill in at the pleasure of the grantees and without the consent of the city, now to hold that all this expenditure may go for naught at the pleasure of the city.\n If the sinking fund ordinance is to be applied at all to the filling in of the land in the limits within the deeds, it should in our judgment be regarded as a mere police \n\n[271 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n requirement of a permit incident to the filling and to supervising its execution by regulation as to time and method, so that it should not disturb the public order. Had the refusal of the commissioner of docks, charged with the police regulation as to the docks, taken this form, an application for mandamus might well have been denied, because only an effort to control the police discretion of the public authorities; but the refusal to permit the filling to begin is not put on any such ground. It is denied because the city has a different plan, which does not permit the filling at all. This is an assertion of the right of the city absolutely to prevent the filling which is an impairment of the obligation of the contract, made by the city with these plaintiffs, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARMOUR & CO. v. FT. MORGAN S. S. CO.(1926)\nNo. 135\nArgued: January 14, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John D. Grace, of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. Victor Leovy, of New Orleans, La., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This libel was filed on January 25, 1918, by Armour & Co., against the Steamship Ft. Morgan in the federal District Court for eastern Louisiana. Recovery was sought for loss and damage to a shipment of 420 head of cattle received by the ship at Port Limon, Costa, Rica, for delivery at Jacksonville, Fla. The charge was that unseaworthiness had caused her to list so heavily as to compel return to port and abandonment of the voyage, \n\n[270 U.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n and that thereby half of the cattle were killed and the rest seriously injured. The libel alleged that the vessel was engaged as a common carrier between the ports named; that the cattle belonged to the libelant; that the bill of lading signed by the master was issued after delivery of the cattle on board. The copy of the bill of lading annexed to the complaint was signed 'The Central American Cattle Co., Inc., by Thomas Johannesen, Master S. S. Ft. Morgan.' It recited: 'Freight prepaid as per contract, subject to live stock agreement.'\n The owner made claim, impleaded the Cattle Company, and showed that the actual transaction was very different from that set forth in the libel. The shipment was an incident of a contract made October 3, 1917, by the Cattle Company with Armour & Co. to procure in Central American countries about 25,000 head of cattle and sell them to Armour & Co.; to assemble these from time to time at Port Limon for rest, inspection, and loading; to charter and equip two steamers, and by means of these vessels to transport the cattle from Port Limon to Jacksonville and make delivery there. The contract provided further for attendance of an Armour representative at the inspection, grading, weighing, and loading at Port Limon; that the vessels should carry only cattle for Armour & Co.; and that a supercargo representing them should have supervision over the care of the cattle during the voyage. It fixed the price per pound to be paid for different grades of cattle and the freight per head, and provided that payment of the purchase price and the freight be made at New Orleans upon receipt of cable advice from the Armour representative.\n The Ft. Morgan had been chartered by the Cattle Company. She listed when she left Port Limon, and had to return to port and abandon the voyage. But she had been seaworthy when delivered to the Cattle Company as charterer, and was thereafter. The loss is claimed to \n\n[270 U.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n have resulted from the abuse of the ship by the Cattle Company, under the supervision of Armour & Co.'s supercargo. The charter party, entitled a 'Time Charter-West India Fruit Trade,' provided the privilege of and facilities for erecting a light fruit deck to carry a load of fruit. At Port Limon she was, without the consent of the owner, converted into a cattle ship. On the deck, authorized as a fruit deck, cattle pens were constructed and the heavy cattle were loaded. Freight had not been paid when the bill of lading issued; nor was it ever paid. No payment for the cattle was ever made under the contract. After the voyage was abandoned, the Cattle Company brought suit against the Armours at New Orleans. Later the parties entered into an agreement to settle their differences out of court. The compromise provided for a new trade arrangement, for holding on joint account the surviving 200 head of injured cattle then at Port Limon, and for the payment by the Armours of.$19,000 upon performance by he Cattle Company of conditions set forth in the new agreement. Seven days later this libel was filed. There was no reservation of right under the bill of lading, or of any rights against the ship. Through investigations incident to the defense the owner first learned the facts.\n The District Court dismissed the libel, with costs, finding the facts substantially as stated above. The libelant had insisted that the ship was liable because the master had signed the bill of lading, and that, having been unseaworthy, she would have been liable, even without such signing, since the master had received the cattle on board. The court held, in an unpublished opinion, that, while the vessel would ordinarily be liable for any damage resulting from unseaworthiness, there could be no recovery in this case, because the unseaworthiness had resulted from the conversion of the vessel into a cattle ship; that this conversion involved a change in the charter party, which \n\n[270 U.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n the master was without authority to make (Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat. 605, 639); that the owner could not be subjected thereby to liability; that, moreover, under the terms of the charter party, the owner would be entitled to be indemnified by the charterers for any judgment in favor of Armour & Co.; that the compromise made by Armour & Co. with knowledge that the vessel was chartered barred this suit; and that, in any event, recovery could not be had on the allegations of the libel.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 297 F. 813. It held that the bill of lading, although signed by the master, did not indicate a purpose to bind the ship; that this fact, taken in connection with the pre-existing contract, required the conclusion that the shipper's contract of affreightment was only with the Cattle Company; and that, under these circumstances, the ship could not be held. That court did not pass upon or discuss the grounds of decision adopted by the District Court. Nor did it refer to the well-established rule that the ship is ordinarily liable to the shipper upon an implied warranty of seaworthiness, although a bill of lading signed by the charterer is given. See The Carib Prince, 18 S. Ct. 753, \n170 U.S. 655\n, 660; The Esrom (C. C. A.) 272 F. 266. A petition for a writ of certiorari, sought on the ground that this basis of liability had been ignored, was granted. 45 S. Ct. 94, \n266 U.S. 597\n. The respondent had not opposed the granting of the writ, and it did not attempt here, in the brief and argument on the merits, to support the ground of decision stated by the Court of Appeals. It insisted that the judgment should be affirmed substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court.\n The suit is brought to enforce the lien or privilege against the vessel which the maritime law gives as security for the contract of affreightment. The contract contained in the bill of lading was that of the Cattle Company. The bill of lading, which was signed by that com- \n\n[270 U.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n pany, is not to be treated as an isolated transaction. It referred to a contract between the parties. It was in fact given in part performance of the obligations assumed by the Cattle Company by the original contract to purchase the cattle, assemble them at Port Limon, sell them to the Armours, and transport them to Jacksonville. The compromise agreement substituted new rights and obligations for the obligations assumed by, and the liabilities incurred under, the original contract. Thereby it discharged the primary liabilities of the Cattle Company to the Armours under both the original contract and the bill of lading to carry safely the cattle from Port Limon to Jacksonville. The discharge of this primary liability necessarily discharged also the liability of the ship as surety for the charterers' obligation set forth in the bill of lading. For this reason, and also because of the facts found by the District Court concerning the unauthorized conversion of the vessel into a cattle ship with the participation of the Armours, the libel was properly dismissed.\n An objection to the jurisdiction taken by the owner both here and below must be noticed. On the face of the libel there was confessedly admiralty jurisdiction. The contention is that the facts developed later disclosed a transaction not wholly maritime, and that, for this reason, the libel should have been dismissed under the rule declared in Grant v. Poillon, 20 How. 162, 168, 169. The District Court stated that it was 'inclined to agree with the contention,' but apparently did not pass definitely upon the matter. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not mention the objection. The decree entered was a general one, dismissing the libel, as on the merits. If there was no jurisdiction, the decree should have recited that ground of dismissal, so as to be without prejudice.\n The case is not of that class where the existence of jurisdiction is conclusively determined by the first pleading of him who institutes the suit. Compare Clarke v. \n\n[270 U.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n Mathewson, 12 Pet. 164; Boston & Montana Mining Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co., 23 S. Ct. 434, \n188 U.S. 632\n. Jurisdiction in admiralty cannot be effectively acquired by concealing for a time the facts which establish that it does not exist. Compare Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 42 S. Ct. 349, \n258 U.S. 377\n, 382. We must therefore consider whether the facts developed after the filing of the libel preclude the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction. The bill of lading and the charter party are both maritime contracts, and hence enforceable in a court of admiralty. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How, 491; The Eddy, 5 Wall. 481, 494. The original contract to purchase, assemble, and sell the cattle, to charter vessels and therein transport the cattle to Jacksonville, and the agreement of compromise, are not maritime contracts. The Richard Winslow, 71 F. 426, 18 C. C. A. 344; The Ada, 250 F. 194, 162 C. C. A. 330. Both the original contract and the compromise agreement are referred to, in order to establish the fact that the obligation for which the ship was surety had been discharged. The original contract was referred to, also, to explain the relation of the shipper named in the bill of lading to the charterer, and in order to establish that by reason of their co-operation in converting the vessel into a cattle ship there was no liability. Such uses of nonmaritime contracts to establish the absence of a valid maritime claim, or a defense as distinguished from a counterclaim1 (see The Eclipse, 10 S. Ct. 873, \n135 U.S. 599\n, 609), do not de- \n\n[270 U.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n prive the admiralty court of jurisdiction. No party to this suit sought to enforce any right under either of the nonmaritime contracts.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Also Willard v.

VALOTTA(1926)\nNo. 521\nArgued: March 5, 1926Decided: March 15, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. James O. Campbell, of Butler, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. George R. Wallace, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order on a writ of habeas corpus discharging the relator, Valotta, from the custody \n\n[270 U.S. 424, 425]\n\u00a0\n of the appellant, by whom he was held under a sentence of death. Valotta shot a man in a street brawl-we will assume, in circumstances that suggest considerable excuse-and then killed a policeman who pursued him, within a short distance from the first act. He was indicted separately for the murder of each man, tried in a Court of Pennsylvania, found guilty of murder in the second degree for the first killing and guilty of murder in the first degree for the second, and was sentenced to death. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.\n No writ of error or certiorari was applied for, Valotta having no funds and his counsel being ignorant of the statute authorizing proceedings in such cases without prepayment of fees or costs. But when the time for such proceedings had gone by, a writ of habeas corpus was obtained from a judge of the District Court of the United States with the result that we have stated. The grounds of the order seem to have been that Valotta was tried upon two indictments for felony at the same time and was deprived of the full number of challenges that he would have had if he had been tried separately upon each.\n There is no question that the State Court had jurisdiction. But the much abused suggestion is made that it lost jurisdiction by trying the two indictments together. Manifestly this would not be true even if the trial was not warranted by law. But the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has said that there was no mistake of law, and so far as the law of Pennsylvania was concerned it was most improper to attempt to go behind the decision of the Supreme Court, to construe statutes as opposed to it and to hear evidence that the practice of the State had been the other way. The question of constitutional power is the only one that could be raised, if even that were open upon this collateral attack, and as to that we cannot doubt that Pennsylvania could authorize the whole story \n\n[270 U.S. 424, 426]\n\u00a0\n to be brought out before the jury at once, even though two indictments were involved, without denying due process of law. If any question was made at the trial as to the loss of the right to challenge twenty jurors on each indictment, the only side of it that would be open here, would be again the question of constitutional power. That Pennsylvania could limit the challenges on each indictment to ten does not admit doubt.\n There was not the shadow of a ground for interference with this sentence by habeas corpus. Frank v. Mangum, 35 S. Ct. 582, \n237 U.S. 309\n, 326. Extraordinary cases where there is only the form of a court under the domination of a mob as was alleged to be the fact in Moore v. Dempsey, 43 S. Ct. 265, \n261 U.S. 86\n, offers no analogy to this. In so delicate a matter as interrupting the regular administration of the criminal law of the State by this kind of attack too much discretion cannot be used, and it must be realized that it can be done only upon definitely and narrowly limited grounds.\n Order reversed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R.

St. s 1010), as supplemented by amendment of section 33 by Act Aug. 23, 1916 (Comp. St. s 1015).\n Messrs. R. P. Henshall and Wm. H.

Ehrman, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant brought suit in the superior court of San Francisco county, Cal., for the surrender and cancellation of a deed of land and to recover money received by the appellee Noyes, a receiver acting under the appointment of an Alaska court, and deposited by him with the appellee bank, as rents derived from the land conveyed and as proceeds of the sale of part of it. The conveyance was made by appellant to receivers, predecessors in office of the appellee Noyes, appointed by the District Court for the District of Alaska. Relief was sought on the ground that the conveyance had been procured by duress. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for Northern California, and trial in that court resulted in a decree for the plaintiff. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals the decree was reversed on the ground that the suit was barred by laches. 298 F. 689. The case comes to this court on appeal. Judicial Code, s 241 (Comp. St. s 1218), before Act of February 13, 1925 ( 43 Stat. 936).\n The jurisdiction of the District Court was not challenged in the Circuit Court of Appeals; nor is it challenged here. The petition for removal from the state court to the District Court and the motion to remand, made and denied in the latter, are not shown in the record. They were omitted from the transcript made up on appeal \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n to the Circuit Court of Appeals, because the parties had so stipulated under rule 75 of the Equity Rules then in force (226 U. S. Appendix, p. 23) relating to the reduction and preparation of transcripts on appeals in suits in equity. It therefore does not affirmatively appear on what ground the removal to the District Court was sought, allowed and sustained. But an examination of the bill, which is set forth in the record, shows that the purpose of the suit was to recover land and funds then in charge of the receiver of a court in Alaska which was created by laws of Congress, and derived its powers and authority from those laws. Such a suit was removable under section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1010), as supplemented by the amendment of section 33 by the Act of August 23, 1916, c. 399, 39 Stat. 532 (Comp. St. s 1015). Matarazzo v. Hustis (D. C.) 256 F. 882, 887-889; see Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cox, 12 S. Ct. 905, \n145 U.S. 593\n, 603; Board of Commissioners v. Peirce (C. C.) 90 F. 764. The alleged right to recover grew out of transactions between the plaintiff and the receivers within the territory of Alaska with reference to land located in Alaska, in all of which the receivers were acting in virtue of authority conferred on them as officers of the Alaska court. Rouse v. Hornsby, 16 S. Ct. 610, \n161 U.S. 588\n, 590. As all this is apparent from the face of the bill, and as the removal is not challenged here, we think the presumption should be indulged that the removal was rightly taken, and that the District Court had jurisdiction.\n We recognize that property in charge of a receiver is in the custody of the court by which he was appointed and under which he is acting, and that as a general rule other courts cannot entertain a suit against the receiver to recover such property, except by leave of the court of his appointment. Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, 43 S. Ct. 480, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 88\n, 89 S.. But the record shows that shortly after this suit was begun, the court in Alaska expressly authorized the receiver to appear in the suit and to make defense \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n and present a counterclaim in it. This was the full equivalent of granting leave to bring the suit. That the order was made shortly after, instead of before the suit was begun, is not material. Jerome v. McCarter, \n94 U.S. 734\n, 737; Board of Commissioners v. Peirce, supra, 765, 766. The plaintiff contended and the District Court held that, even if there had been no such leave, the suit could be maintained under the legislative permission given in section 66 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1048); but we need not consider that question.\n On January 5, 1911, the District Court for Alaska appointed receivers for the Washington-Alaska Bank, a Nevada banking corporation engaged in business in Fairbanks, Alaska. The husband of the appellant had been the president, director and manager of the bank from its incorporation. In February, 1911, the appellant, then residing in Los Angeles, Cal., went with her husband to Fairbanks to assist in the liquidation of the bank's business, its assets and affairs being then in the hands of the receivers. Six weeks later, after consultation with their attorney, appellant and her husband tendered to one of the depositors of the bank as trustee for the unpaid depositors, a deed conveying real estate of the husband and real estate which was the separate property of the appellant, located in Alaska. Acceptance of the deed was refused on the ground that by it criminal prosecution of the husband and enforcement of his civil liability might be prejudiced or waived. Later a similar deed was tendered to the receivers and rejected by them for the same reasons. Appellant and her husband then filed a verified petition in the court in which the receivership was pending, praying that the receivers be directed to accept the trust deed and expressing the desire to prevent the commencement of legal proceedings against them by the receivers and to pay all the depositors of the bank in full. The court made an order authorizing the receivers, as \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n such, to accept the deed and administer the trusts created by it, in connection with their duties as receivers.\n The deed was executed by appellant and her husband on March 18, 1911, and was separately acknowledged by appellant, the certificate of acknowledgment stating that she executed it voluntarily and that 'she did not wish to retract it.' The receivers took possession of the property in Alaska; they and later their successor, the appellee, Noyes, received the rents from it and the proceeds of sale of some of the land, and the fund now in dispute was derived from the administration of the trust.\n Within a week after executing the conveyance appellant departed from Alaska with her husband and returned to her residence at Los Angeles. More than three years later, on November 16, 1914, she instituted suit in the Alaska court against the receivers, to set aside the conveyance of her separate property on the ground that it had been procured by duress. The case was not brought to trial and after more than three years, on August 1, 1918, she consented to a nonsuit, having in the meantime, on July 24, 1918, commenced the present suit.\n The District Court below held that appellant's conveyance had been procured by duress. This conclusion was based on findings that during the period of appellant's sojourn in Alaska in 1911 threats or 'suggestions' were made to her (which it appears were made by two women depositors of the bank and by others who are unidentified) that her children would be kidnapped and her husband and herself subjected to personal violence; that under the circumstances these threats aroused in her a reasonable fear for the safety of her children, her husband and herself, and induced the execution of the deed to the receivers.\n We turn aside from the objections pressed upon us that the evidence was insufficient to establish duress and that in neither pleading nor proof is it suggested that the \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n receivers or the great majority of the creditors of the bank were parties to or aware of the alleged duress. See Fairbanks v. Snow, 13 N. E. 596, 145 Mass. 153, 1 Am. St. Rep. 446. Nor need we consider any of the numerous defenses interposed, except the acquiescence of appellant in her deed, and her delay in asserting her rights, which, in the circumstances, are decisive of the case.\n Appellant's cause of action is necessarily founded upon the assertion of the rightful and effective exercise of the power to disaffirm her conveyance, which arose as soon as she was relieved from the compulsion of the alleged duress. Acts induced by duress such as is here relied on, which operates only on the mind and falls short of actual physical compulsion, are not void in law, but are voidable only, at the election of him whose act was induced by it. Andrews v. Connolly (C. C.) 145 F. 43, 46; Miller v. Davis, 122 P. 793, 52 Colo. 485, 494; Eberstein v. Willetts, 24 N. E. 967, 134 Ill. 101; Fairbanks v. Snow, supra; Miller v. Lumber Co., 57 N. W. 101, 98 Mich. 163, 39 Am. St. Rep. 524; Oregon & P. R. R. Co. v. Forrest, 28 N. E. 137, 128 N. Y. 83. If there was duress here, appellant, as soon as she was relieved from its operation, was in a position either to disaffirm her conveyance or to allow it to stand undisturbed as the free and formal disposition of her rights. If her choice was to disaffirm, it might have been evidenced by suit timely brought or by any other action disclosing her purpose to those who would be affected.\n In that situation she was subject to the requirement of equity that an election to disaffirm and to recall the legal consequences of an act which has operated to alter legal rights by transferring them to others, must be exercised promptly. Andrews v. Connolly and other cases cited, supra, show how this requirement is applied in cases of duress. The principle has a like application where the right is founded on fraud. Upton, Assignee, v. Tribilcock, \n91 \nU.S. 45, 54\n, 55 S.; Wheeler v. McNeil, 101 F. 685, 41 C. C. A. 604; Blank v. Aronson, 187 F. 241, 109 C. C. A. 327. \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 445]\n\u00a0\n What promptness of action a court may reasonably exact in these circumstances must depend in large measure upon the effect of lapse of time without such disaffirmance, upon those whose rights are sought to be divested. The appellant formed the intention of taking proceedings to set aside her conveyance immediately on her return to Los Angeles, in April, 1911. This intention remained undisclosed for more than three years until she brought suit in the district court of Alaska in November, 1914. There is no evidence that the threats of violence were renewed after she left Alaska, or that they operated to prevent the prompt exercise of her election when she had returned to her home in Los Angeles. Her husband was brought to trial upon criminal charges growing out of his administration of the affairs of the bank, and criminal proceedings were concluded in December, 1912, or in 1913. During the period from April, 1911, until November, 1914, appellant, who was represented in Alaska by counsel and by an attorney in fact, was aware that the receivers, and later the appellee Noyes, none of whom was shown to have had any knowledge of the alleged duress, were engaged in the administration of the trust created by appellant's conveyance, under an order of the court obtained on her petition. During that period, she made no effort to advise the court or the receivers of the alleged duress or of her intention to disaffirm her deed.\n By the provisions of the deed, the grantees were given unrestricted power of sale of the property after November, 1914, but it was expressly provided that sales might be made in the meantime by the united action of the grantors and grentees, and the proceeds paid to the grantees under the trust provisions of the deed. Appellant joined with her husband and the appellee receiver in a sale of one of the plots of her separate property, the conveyance being executed in her behalf by her attorney \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 446]\n\u00a0\n in fact and the proceeds being paid to the appellee in November, 1911. This unexplained delay of more than three years in exercising appellant's asserted right to disaffirm her conveyance, while the appellee and his predecessors were left in ignorance of her intention to assert it, and her affirmative action as well, in recognizing the validity of her deed and the authority of the appellee under it, establish conclusively her election to allow her conveyance to stand as the unrevoked and effective agency for the disposition of her rights.\n The case is not one which requires us to consider the effect of mere delay in bringing suit to enforce a claim of which appellees had notice, with the consequent opportunity to protect themselves, in some measure, from the prejudice which would otherwise result from mere lapse of time, as in Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, 12 S. Ct. 239, \n142 U.S. 417\n, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogart, 39 S. Ct. 533, \n250 U.S. 483\n, relied upon by appellant. Nor have we to do with a situation where complainant's silence did not mislead or prejudice the defendants, as in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, 33 S. Ct. 554, \n228 U.S. 482\n, also relied upon. Here the very existence of the appellant's right depends upon the timely exercise of her election to disaffirm the deed. Delay in its exercise was necessarily prejudicial to her grantees; for they were entitled to and did rely and act upon the authority of her deed, and their defense under the circumstances was necessarily impeded and embarrassed by the lapse of time during the period in which they were left in ignorance of appellant's claim.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, with whom Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs, dissenting.\n In my opinion, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed with directions to the District \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 447]\n\u00a0\n Court to remand the case to the state court, or this court should, in its discretion, order that copies of all papers in the District Court relating to the removal be filed here, so that we may determine whether the lower courts have properly exercised jurisdiction. Compare order issued February 1, 1926, in No. 10, Whitney v. California, Sup. Ct. Journ. 176.\n The determination of the jurisdiction of the courts below is one of the essential functions of this court. Cochran v. Montgomery County, 26 S. Ct. 58, \n199 \nU.S. 260, 270\n, 4 S. Ann. Cas. 451. 'On every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction, first, of this court, and then of the court from which the record comes. This question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise suggested, and without respect to the relation of the parties to it.' Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, 4 S. Ct. 510, 511, \n111 U.S. 379\n, 382 (28 L. Ed. 462); Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co. v. Willard, 31 S. Ct. 460, \n220 U.S. 413\n, 419; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. v. City of Parkersburg, 45 S. Ct. 382, \n268 U.S. 35\n. The record must show affirmatively 'the fact on which jurisdiction depends. It is not sufficient that jurisdiction may be inferred argumentatively, from its averments.' Brown v. Keene, 8 Pet. 112, 115 (8 L. Ed. 885); Hanford v. Davies, 16 S. Ct. 1051, \n163 U.S. 273\n, 279. If the jurisdictional facts appear affirmatively somewhere in the record, the case need not be dismissed merely because the pleadings fail to show them. Robertson v. Cease, \n97 U.S. 646\n, 648; Realty Holding Co. v. Donaldson, 45 S. Ct. 521, \n268 U.S. 398\n, 400. Amendment of the pleadings to conform to the facts shown by the record may be allowed either in the lower courts or in this court. Norton v. Larney, 45 S. Ct. 145, \n266 U.S. 511\n, 516. The record before this court, which consists of 742 printed pages and several unprinted documents, includes everything which was before the Circuit Court of Appeals, but not the whole record before the District Court. \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 448]\n\u00a0\n What parts were omitted does not appear. The essential jurisdictional facts are not shown in the pleadings or elsewhere in the record.\n The record in this court shows a bill of complaint to have a conveyance of real estate in Alaska annulled on the ground of duress and to have paid to the plaintiff moneys alleged to have been deposited in the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank of San Francisco by one Noyes, claiming to act as receiver of a Nevada corporation. These funds are alleged to be the proceeds of a part of the real estate. The complaint is entitled 'Superior Court of the State of California.' The record shows next an answer filed in the federal court for the Northern district of the state. All subsequent proceedings prior to the appeal were had in that federal court. From these facts, it may merely be surmised that the suit was begun in the state court and before answer removed to the federal court. But the record does not contain the petition for removal, nor any of the other papers ordinarily incident thereto. There is no reference to a removal in any order or decree, in any opinion, in the evidence, nor in any other paper or clerk's entry. The complaint did not allege the citizenship of the plaintiff. An amendment to the complaint, filed in the federal court two years later, states that the plaintiff has at all times been a citizen of California. The defendants named are the Wells Fargo Bank and one Noyes; the latter being joined both individually and as receiver appointed 'not lawfully' but an Alaska court for a Nevada corporation. No allegation discloses the citizenship of Noyes. It does not appear anywhere in the record whether an ancillary receiver of the Nevada corporation was ever appointed in California.\n A multitude of questions remain unanswered in this state of the record. Thus, we are left to conjecture whether all the defendants joined in the petition for re- \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 449]\n\u00a0\n moval,1 and if not, by whom removal was sought;2 on what ground removal was sought, whether that ground was good in law, and whether it was substantiated by the facts appearing of record;3 from what court removal was sought;4 what action the court and the respective parties took; and whether, indeed, there was a proper petition for removal filed in time. \n5\n On this record it seems to me that this court is without jurisdiction and that the lower federal courts were also. Hegler v. Faulkner, 8 S. Ct. 1203, \n127 U.S. 482\n. As stated in West v. Aurora City, 6 Wall. 139, 142 (18 L. Ed. 819):\n'It is equally fatal to the supposed right of removal that the record presents only a fragment of a cause, unintelligible except by reference to other matters not sent up from the state court and through explanations of counsel.'\n\n'There are no presumptions in favor of the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.' Ex parte Smith, \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 450]\n\u00a0\n \n94 U.S. 455\n, 456 (24 L. Ed. 165); Bible Society v. Grove, \n101 U.S. 610\n. We may not assume that there was jurisdiction merely because two lower courts have exercised it, apparently without protest. \n6\n We may not assume that documents omitted from the appellate record by agreement under equity rule 75 showed jurisdiction. The requirement that jurisdictional facts be affirmatively shown cannot be dispensed with. Compare Hudson v. Parker, 15 S. Ct. 450, \n156 U.S. 277\n, 284. We may not indulge in conjecture as to the ground on which jurisdiction was invoked. If we were at liberty to do so, what appears in the fragmentary record before us would preclude our sustaining jurisdiction. Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground of diversity of citizenship, because the citizenship of the principal defendant is not disclosed. Jurisdiction could not be sustained under section 33, Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of August 23, 1916, c. 399, 39 Stat. 532 (Comp. St. s 1015), as a civil suit against 'any officer of the courts of the United States for or on account of any act done under color of his office or in the performance of his duties as such officer' (compare Matarazzo v. Hustis (D. C.) 256 F. 882), because there is nothing to show that removal was sought upon this ground, or that the requirements of the statute were complied with (compare Ex parte Anderson, Fed. Cas. No. 349, 3 Woods, 124; Rothschild v. Matthews (C. C.) 22 F. 6), or that there was 'a causal connection between what the officer has done' and his asserted official authority. See Maryland v. Soper, 46 S. Ct. 185, \n270 U.S. 9\n. Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground that the proceeding is ancillary, because no receiver of the Alaska bank was appointed in California, nor was its estate being administered there (Mer- \n\n[270 U.S. 438, 451]\n\u00a0\n cantile Trust Co. v. Kanawha & Ohio Ry. Co. (C. C.) 39 F. 337; Compare Greene v. Star Cash & Package Co. (C. C.) 99 F. 656), and the ancillary character of the suit furnishes no ground for removal (Gilmore v. Herrick ( C. C.) 93 F. 525. Compare Byers v. McAuley, 13 S. Ct. 906, \n149 U.S. 608\n, 618-620; Shinney v. North American Savings & Loan Bldg. Co. ( C. C.) 97 F. 9). Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground that the case is one 'arising under the ... laws of the United States,' because the mere fact that the defendant Noyes is the reputed receiver of a state corporation appointed by a federal court is not a ground for removal. \n7\n Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur & Evansville Ry. Co., 21 S. Ct. 171, \n179 U.S. 335\n. The record shows no other way in which the case arises under the laws of the United States.

THE PESARO(1926)\nNo. 334\nArgued: May 7, 1926Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 562, 563]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Oscar R. Houston, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 562, 565]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Homer L. Loomis, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 562, 569]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a libel in rem against the steamship Pesaro on a claim for damages arising out of a failure to deliver certain artificial silk accepted by her at a port in Italy for \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 570]\n\u00a0\n carriage to the port of New York. The usual process issued, on which the vessel was arrested, and subsequently she was released, a bond being given for her return, or the payment of the libelant's claim, if the court had jurisdiction and the claim was established. In the libel the vessel was described as a general ship engaged in the common carriage of merchandise for hire. The Italian ambassador to the United States appeared and on behalf of the Italian government specially set forth that the vessel at the time of her arrest was owned and possessed by that government, was operated by it in its service and interest, and therefore was immune from process of the courts of the United States. At the hearing it was stipulated that the vessel, when arrested, was owned, possessed, and controlled by the Italian government, was not connected with its naval or military forces, was employed in the carriage of merchandise for hire between Italian ports and ports in other countries including the port of New York, and was so employed in the service and interest of the whole Italian nation, as distinguished from any individual member thereof, private or official, and that the Italian government never had consented that the vessel be seized or proceeded against by judicial process. On the facts so appearing the court sustained the plea of immunity, and on that ground entered a decree dismissing the libel for want of jurisdiction. This direct appeal is from that decree and was taken before the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936), became effective.\n The single question presented for decision by us is whether a ship owned and possessed by a foreign government, and operated by it in the carriage of merchandise for hire, is immune from arrest under process based on a libel in rem by a private suitor in a federal District Court exercising admiralty jurisdiction.\n This precise question never has been considered by this court before. Several efforts to present it have been made \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 571]\n\u00a0\n in recent years, but always in circumstances which did not require its consideration. The nearest approach to it in this court's decisions is found in The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116, where the opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall. There a libel was brought by citizens of this country against an armed vessel in the possession of French naval officers; the libelants' claim being that they were the true owners, that the vessel had been wrongfully taken from them and then converted into an armed vessel, and the they were entitled to have it restored to them through a proceeding in admiralty. Diplomatic correspondence resulted in the presentation by a law officer of this government of a formal suggestion in the suit to the effect that at the time of the arrest under the libel the vessel was claimed and possessed by the French government as a warship, was temporarily within our waters for a lawful purpose, and therefore was immune from the process whereon she was arrested. In the opinion the Chief Justice attributed to every nation an exclusive and absolute jurisdiction within its own territory, subject to no limitation not having its consent, observed that the consent might be either express or implied, and then said (page 136):\n'The word being composed of distinct sovereignties, possessing equal rights and equal independence, whose mutual benefit is promoted by intercourse with each other, and by an interchange of those good offices which humanity dictates and its wants require, all sovereigns have consented to a relaxation in practice, in cases under certain peculiar circumstances, of that absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective territories which sovereignty confers.\n\n'This consent may, in some instances, be tested by common usage, and by common opinion, growing out of that usage.\n\n'A motion would justly be considered as violating its faith, although that faith might not be expressly plighted, \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 572]\n\u00a0\n which should suddenly and without previous notice, exercise its territorial powers in a manner not consonant to the usages and received obligations of the civilized world.\n\n'This full and absolute territorial jurisdiction being alike the attribute of every sovereign, and being incapable of conferring extraterritorial power, would not seem to contemplate foreign sovereigns nor their sovereign rights as its objects. One sovereign being in no respect amenable to another, and being bound by obligations of the highest character not to degrade the dignity of his nation, by placing himself or its sovereign rights within the jurisdiction of another, can be supposed to enter a foreign territory only under an express license, or in the confidence that the immunities belonging to his independent sovereign station, though not expressly stipulated, are reserved by implication, and will be extended to him.\n\n'This perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and this common interest impelling them to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of good offices with each other, have given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation.'\n\n After discussing the statute of a sovereign, his ministers and his troops when they or any of them enter the territory of another sovereign, he proceeded (page 141):\n'If there be no treaty applicable to the case, and the sovereign, from motives deemed adequate by himself, permits his ports to remain open to the public ships of foreign friendly powers, the conclusion seems irresistable, that they may enter by his assent. And if they enter by his assent necessarily implied, no just reason is perceived by the court for distinguishing their case from that of vessels which enter by express assent.\n\n'In all the cases of exemption which have been reviewed, much has been implied, but the obligation of \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 573]\n\u00a0\n what was implied has been found equal to the obligation of that which was expressed. Are these reasons for denying the application of this principle to ships of war?'\n\n And then, after suggesting that there is a wide difference between the status of private individuals who enter foreign territory, or send their private ships there for purposes of trade, and the status of public war vessels when a foreign waters, he further said (page 145):\n'It seems then to the court to be a principle of public law that national ships of war, entering the port of a friendly power open for their reception, are to be considered as exempted by the consent of that power from its jurisdiction.\n\n'Without doubt, the sovereign of the place is capable of destroying this implication. He may claim and exercise jurisdiction either by employing force, or by subjecting such vessels to the ordinary tribunals. But until such power be exerted in a manner not to be misunderstood, the sovereign cannot be considered as having imparted to the ordinary tribunals a jurisdiction, which it would be a breach of faith to exercise. Those general statutory provisions therefore which are descriptive of the ordinary jurisdiction of the judicial tribunals, which give an individual whose property has been wrested from him, a right to claim that property in the courts of the country, in which it is found, ought not, in the opinion of this court, to be so construed as to give them jurisdiction in a case, in which the sovereign power has impliedly consented to waive its jurisdiction.'\n\n It will be perceived that the opinion, although dealing comprehensively with the general subject, contains no reference to merchant ships owned and operated by a government. But the omission is not of special significance, for in 1812, when the decision was given, merchant ships were operated only by private owners, and there was little thought of governments engaging in such operations. That came much later. \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 574]\n\u00a0\n The decision in The Exchange therefore cannot be taken as excluding merchant ships held and used by a government from the principles there announced. On the contrary, if such ships come within those principles, they must be held to have the same immunity as war ships, in the absence of a treaty or statute of the United Stated evincing a different purpose. No such treaty or statute has been brought to our attention.\n We think the principles are applicable alike to all ships held and used by a government for a public purpose, and that when, for the purpose of advancing the trade of its people or providing revenue for its treasury, a government acquires, mans, and operates ships in the carrying trade, they are public ships in the same sense that war ships are. We know of no international usage which regards the maintenance and advancement of the economic welfare of a people in time of peace of any less a public purpose than the maintenance and training of a naval force.\n The subsequent course of decision in other courts gives strong support to our conclusion.\n In Briggs v. Light Boats, 11 Allen (Mass.) 157, there was involved a proceeding against three vessels to subject them to a lien and to satisfy it through their seizure and sale. The boats had been recently acquired by the United States and were destined for use as floating lights to aid navigation. Whether their ownership and intended use rendered them immune from such a proceeding and seizure was the principal question. In answering it in the affirmative the state court, speaking through Mr. Justice Gray, afterwards a member of this court, said (page 163):\n'These vessels were not held by the United States, as property might perhaps be held by a monarch, in a private or personal, rather than in a public or political character. ... They were, in the precise and emphatic language of the plea to the jurisdiction, 'held \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 575]\n\u00a0\n and owned by the United States for public uses.\"\n\n And again (page 165):\n'The immunity from such interference arises, not because they are instruments of war, but because they are instruments of sovereignty, and does not depend on the extent or manner of their actual use at any particular moment, but on the purpose to which they are devoted.'\n\n In the Parlement Belge, L. R. 5 P. D. 197, the question was whether a vessel belonging to Belgium and used by that government in carrying the mail and in transporting passengers and freight for hire could be subjected to a libel in rem in the admiralty court of Great Britain. The Court of Appeal gave a negative answer and put its ruling on two grounds, one being that the vessel was public property of a foreign government in use for national purposes. After reviewing many cases bearing on the question, including The Exchange, the court said:\n'The principle to be deduced from all these cases is that, as a consequence of the absolute independence of every sovereign authority, and of the international comity which induces every soverign state to respect the independence and dignity of every other sovereign state, each and every one declines to exercise by means of its courts any of its territorial jurisdiction over the person of any sovereign or ambassador of any other state, or over the public property of any state which is destined to public use, or over the property of any ambassador, though such sovereign, ambassador, or property be within its territory, and, therefore, but for the common agreement, subject to its jurisdiction.'\n\n Sometimes it is said of that decision that it was put on the ground that a libel in rem under the British admiralty practice is not a proceeding solely against property, but one directly or indirectly impleading the owner-in that instance the Belgian government. But this latter was given as an additional and independent ground, as is expressly stated in the opinion at page 217. \n\n[271 U.S. 562, 576]\n\u00a0\n The ruling in that case has been consistently followed and applied in England from 1880, when it was made, to the present day. Young v. The Scotia, (1903) A. C. 501; The Jassy, L. R. (1906) P. D. 270; The Gagara, L. R. (1919) P. D. 95; The Porto Alexandre, L. R. (1920) P. D. 30; The Jupiter, L. R. (1924) P. D. 236.\n In the lower federal courts there has been some diversity of opinion on the question, but the prevailing view has been that merchant ships owned and operated by a foreign government have the same immunity that war ships have. Among the cases so holding is The Maipo (D. C.) 252 F. 627, and 259 F. 367. The principal case announcing the other view is The Pesaro ( D. C.) 277 F. 473. That was a preliminary decision in the present case, but it is not the one now under review, which came later and was the other way.\n We conclude that the general words of section 24, cl. 3, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), investing the District Courts with jurisdiction of 'all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' must be construed, in keeping with the last paragraph before quoted from The Exchange, as not intended to include a libel in rem against a public ship, such as the Pesaro, of a friendly foreign government. It results from this that the court below rightly dismissed the libel for want of jurisdiction.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLAIR v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 713\nArgued: May 4, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Messrs. T. H. Lewis, Jr., and Sewall Key, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. James Craig Peacock and John W. Townsend, both of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1920, Margaret Murphy, testatrix of respondents, paid without protest, to the collector of internal revenue at Philadelphia, the sum of $ 88,956.92 as income tax for the year 1919. On May 18, 1923, a claim was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for a refund of $35,054.85 as an overpayment of her taxes for 1919. On May 19, 1924, the Commissioner signed a 'schedule of overassessment and allowance of abatement, credit and refund,' in the amount claimed, and gave certain instructions to the collector with respect to it. On a statement from the collector that the amount claimed was subject to refund, the Commissioner, on August 12, 1924, signed an authorization to the disbursing clerk of the Treasury to pay to respondents the refund demanded, with interest computed from November 18, 1923 (six months after the filing of the claim for refund, as provided by section 1324 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6371 4\/5 j), which he deemed applicable) \n\n[271 U.S. 348, 350]\n\u00a0\n to May 19, 1924, the date on which the Commissioner signed the schedule of overassessment.\n Respondents protested the amount of interest allowed, and demanded that it be computed on the excess of each quarterly payment from the date when it was made, in 1920, to August 12, 1924, the date upon which the Commissioner signed the authorization to the disbursing clerk. Upon the refusal of the Commissioner to allow this claim, respondents petitioned the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to compel him to compute and allow the interest demanded. The Commissioner, the petitioner here, filed an answer, to which the respondents demurred. The Supreme Court of the District sustained the demurrer and granted the writ; and, upon appeal, the Court of Appeals sustained the judgment, modifying it in only one particular, not important to the decision in this case. This court granted certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 545\n, 46 S. Ct. 102, 70 L. Ed. -.\n The government having expressly waived the point made below that mandamus will not lie, only two questions are presented for consideration here. One is the date from which, the other is the date to which, interest allowed on the refund should be computed. Since the certiorari was allowed, the second question has been decided by this court in Girard Trust Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163\n, 46 S. Ct. 229, March 1, 1926. In that case we held that the date of allowance of the refund, and therefore the date to which interest should be computed under section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 346 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  6371 5\/6 m), is the date on which the Commissioner signed the authorization to the disbursing clerk of the Treasury, directing him to pay the refund. The court below therefore correctly held that interest should be computed to that date, which was August 12, 1924, and that, as this date was subsequent to the enactment of section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924, the allowance of interest must be in accordance with that \n\n[271 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n section, and not section 1324 of the Act of 1921, which had been repealed. Hence we are not concerned with the ruling of the Commissioner, applying the 1921 act, that interest ran only from six months after filing of the claim for refund, because it was based on his erroneous conclusion as to the date when the refund was 'allowed.'\n The question remaining for decision is from what date interest on the refund is to be computed, under section 1019 of the Act of 1924, which provides:\n'Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any internal revenue tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, ... interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such credit or refund at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date such tax ... was paid to the date of the allowance of the refund, or in case of a credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken. ...'\n\n The respondents contend that, as each of the quarterly installments paid by the taxpayer was in excess of one-fourth of the proper amount of the tax for the year, interest allowed on the refund should have been computed, as the court below held, on the excess of each quarterly payment, from the date on which it was paid. But the government argues that such an excess quarterly payment is not a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,' within the meaning of section 1019, if, when it is made, any part of the proper tax for the year has not been paid; that such overpayment becomes a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' only when the amount paid, added to the previous quarterly payments, exceeds the whole tax due for the year. In support of this position, it relies on sections 250 and 252 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 tt, 6336 1\/8 uu), in force when the tax was paid. Section 250(a) provides (page 1082):\n'That ... the tax shall be paid in four install- \n\n[271 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n ments, each consisting of one-fourth of the total amount of the tax . ...\n\n'The tax may at the option of the taxpayer be paid in a single payment instead of in installments. ...'\n\n Subdivision (b) of section 250 provides (page 1083):\n'As soon as practicable after the return is filed, the Commissioner shall examine it. If it then appears that the correct amount of the tax is greater or less than that shown in the return, the installments shall be recomputed. If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis of the installments as recomputed, the excess so paid shall be credited against the subsequent installments; and if the amount already paid exceeds the correct amount of the tax, the excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of section 252.'\n\n Section 252 provides (page 1085):\n'That if, upon examination of any return of income made pursuant to this act ... it appears that an amount of income ... tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then, notwithstanding the provisions of section 3228 of the Revised Statutes, the amount of the excess shall be credited against any income, war-profits or excess profits taxes, or installment thereof, then due from the taxpayer under any other return, and any balance of such excess shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer. ...'\n\n By section 250(a) the payment of the whole tax in a single payment is expressly made optional with the taxpayer, and any payment in excess of the correct amount of a quarterly installment is by section 250(a) to be treated as a payment on account of the whole tax. It is clear that a taxpayer who, anticipating the required quarterly installments, pays the entire tax in one payment, is not entitled to interest or a discount, on the anticipated installments, as upon a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' under section 1019 of the Act of 1924. \n\n[271 U.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n We think that under any reasonable interpretation of section 1019, the payment of a lesser amount which is in excess of the required quarterly installments must stand on the same footing. Under sections 250 and 252 of the Act of 1918, there is no provision for a refund to the taxpayer of any excess payment of a quarterly installment, when the whole tax for the year has not been paid. Read together, these sections show that the mere overpayment of an installment is treated as a payment on account of the tax which is assessed for that year, and is not a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' within the meaning of the refund provisions of section 1019 of the Act of 1924, and so is not subject to its provisions regulating the allowance of interest. Payments in excess of the total amount of the tax, then and subsequently made, are subject to refund or credit under the provisions of section 1019, and interest must be allowed on them at the rate of 6 per cent. from the date of payment.\n The provision of section 1019, that 'in case of a credit' interest is to be allowed 'to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken,' relates to a credit properly allowed of a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,' and has no application to excess payments of quarterly installments which the government was entitled to treat as an advance payment of later installments, under the provisions of section 250.\n The judgment below was erroneous, in so far as it allowed interest on payments made prior to September 27, 1920, on which date the total amount of the installments paid first exceeded the total amount of tax due, by the sum of $12,815.62. Interest should have been allowed on that amount from that date, and on the full amount of the fourth installment from December 13, 1920, when it was paid.\n Judgment reversed with costs to the respondent. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COM'RS v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO.(1926)\nNo. 567\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n A public utility company, which by excessive depreciation charges in the past has created a reserve depreciation account greater than required to adequately maintain its property, cannot be compelled to apply a part of the property or money represented by such reserve to overcome deficits in present or future earnings, and to sustain rates which otherwise could nt be sustained.\n The just compensation, safeguarded to a utility by Const. U. S. Amend. 14, is a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time it is used for public service.\n Constitutional protection against confiscation does not depend on source of money used to purchase property, it being enough that it is used to render service.\n Mr. Thomas Brown, of Perth Amboy, N. J., for appellants.[ Board of Public Utility Com'rs v. New York Telephone Co. \n271 U.S. 23\n (1926) ]\n\n\n[271 U.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. M. Bracelen, of New York City, Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N. J., and Charles T. Russell and Frankland Briggs, both of New York City, for appellee. \n\n[271 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The is an appeal from a decree of the District Court-three judges sitting; section 266, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243)-which granted a temporary injunction restraining the enforcement of certain telephone rates.\n The company owns and opinions a telephone system in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. In the territory served in New Jersey there are a number of local areas. Service between telephones in the same area is exchange service, and that between telephones in different areas is toll service. The latter includes both intrastate and interstate business. The system is used to give exchange and toll service to all subscribers. For about 10 years prior to the commencement of this suit the rates in New Jersey remained at substantially the same level. March 6, 1924, the company filed with the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, to take effect April 1, 1924, a schedule providing for an increase of rates for exchange service in New Jersey. The board suspended the proposed rates pending an investigation as to their reasonableness. December 31, 1924, the increase was disallowed, and the company was required to continue to serve at the existing rates. The board found that the value of the company's property in New Jersey, as of June 30, 1924, was $76,370,000; that a rate of return of 7.53 per cent., producing from $5,750,000 to $6, 000,000, would be a fair return for that year; that the amount charged by the company in 1924 for depreciation, $3,452,000 was excessive, and that $ 2,678,000 was sufficient. And the board found that net earnings in 1924 would be $4,449,000. less than the fair return by at least $1,300,000. \n\n[271 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n The company's accounts are kept according to the uniform system of accounts for telephone companies prescribed by the Inter-state Commerce Commission. Charges are made to cover the depreciation in the elements of the plant which for one cause or another will go out of use. These charges are made month by month against depreciation in the operating expense accounts and corresponding credits are entered in the depreciation reserve account. When a unit or element of the property is retired, there is no charge to operating expense, but its original cost, less salvage, is charged to the reserve account. December 31, 1923, the company's books showed a credit balance in depreciation reserve accounts of $16,902,530. This was not set aside or kept in a separate fund, but was invested in the company's telephone plant. The board prescribed a rule for the determination of depreciation expenses to be charged by the company in 1925 and subsequent years. It declared that the credit balance was more than required for the maintenance of the property, and directed that $4, 750,000 of that amount be used by the company to make up deficits in any year when earnings are less than a reasonable return as found by the board. And it said:\n'But, having made such charges in the past, future charges, beginning January 1, 1925, may be deducted from the normal charge, until such time as at least $4,750,000 of the excess is absorbed as hereinafter provided.'\n\n The effect of the order is to require that, if total operating expenses deducted from revenues leaves less than a reasonable return in 1925 or a subsequent year, there shall be deducted from the expense of depreciation in that year, and added to the net earnings, a sum sufficient to make up the deficiency; then, by appropriate book entries, the resulting shortage in depreciation expense is to be made good out of the balance in the reserve account built up in prior years.\n On the application for a temporary injunction, the company attacked the findings of the board as to rate \n\n[271 U.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n of return, property value, and expense of depreciation, and it contended that the charges on account of depreciation in earlier years were not excessive, and that in any event the company could not be compelled to make up deficits in future net earnings out of the depreciation reserves accumulated in the past.\n The record shows that the rates in effect prior to the temporary injunction were not sufficient to produce revenue enough to pay necessary operating expenses and a just rate of return on the value of the property. There is printed in the margin1 a statement made by the board and included in its decision, giving a comparison of re- \n\n[271 U.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n sults of operation in 1924 under these rates as found by the board and as estimated by the company. And, in opposition to the motion for the temporary injunction, the board submitted an affidavit containing a statement2 \n\n[271 U.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n which set forth in detail the estimated results for 1925 based on the same rates. The affidavit shows net additions to the company's property in New Jersey in 1924, amounting to more than $13,000,000, and the board calculates the return on $88,417,448 as the reasonable value of the property. The calculation is made on three bases: (1) Depreciation taken at the company's figure, $4,128,000; (2) depreciation as found by the board, $3,314,716; and (3) depreciation allowed by the board's order, $683, 430. The effect of the order is to deduct $2,631,286 from operating expenses found by the board properly chargeable for depreciation in 1925. This deduction is made at the expense of the property of the company paid for out of depreciation reserves built up in prior years, and it has the same effect on net earnings as would the addition of the same amount of revenue received for service. On the basis of the company's estimate of depreciation expense, the return is 4.12 per cent.; on the board's estimate it is 4.93 per cent.; and by increasing net earnings $2,631,286, as directed by the order, it is made 7.53 per cent. It is conceded that, unless, as directed by the board, depreciation expense is reduced below what the board itsel found necessary and net earnings are correspondingly increased, the rates cannot be sustained against attack on the ground that they are unreasonably low and confiscatory. Appellants do not contend that the rate of return from the intrastate business is or will be higher than that resulting from the company's business as a whole in New Jersey; and the record supports the claim of the company that the intrastate business or that covered by the exchange rates complained of is not relatively more profitable than the other business of the company.\n It may be assumed, as found by the board, that in prior years the company charged excessive amounts to depreciation expense and so created in the reserve account \n\n[271 U.S. 23, 31]\n\u00a0\n balances greater than required adequately to maintain the property. It remains to be considered whether the company may be compelled to apply any part of the property or money represented by such balances to overcome deficits in present or future earnings and to sustain rates which otherwise could not be sustained.\n The just compensation safeguarded to the utility by the Fourteenth Amendment is a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time that it is being used for the public service, and rates not sufficient to yield that return are confiscatory.

The company is entitled to just compensation and, to have the service, the customers must pay for it. The relation between the company and its customers is not that of partners, agent and principal, or trustee and beneficiary. Cf. Fall River Gas Works v. Gas & Electric Light Com'rs, 102 N. E. 475, 214 Mass. 529, 538. The revenue paid by the customers for service belongs to the company. The amount, if any, remaining after paying taxes and operating expenses including the expense of depreciation is the company's compensation for the use of its property. If there is no return, or if the amount is less than a reasonable return, the company must bear the loss. Past losses cannot be used to enhance the value of the property or to support a claim that rates for the future are confiscatory. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, 42 S.

Their payments are not contributions to depreciation or other operating expenses or to capital of the company. By paying bills for service they do not acquire any interest, legal or equitable, in the property used for their convenience or in the funds of the company. Property paid for out of moneys received for service belongs to the company just as does that purchased out of proceeds of its bonds and stock. It is conceded that the exchange rates complained of are not sufficient to yield a just return after paying taxes and operating expenses, including a proper allowance for current depreciation. The property or money of the company represented by the credit balance in the reserve for depreciation cannot be used to make up the deficiency.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Results under Present Rates-Estimated for the Year 1924.\n By Board, By Company Based on (Exhibit Exhibit C-34, P-14).

INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN(1926)\nNo. 313\nArgued: May 5, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 208, 209]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George A. Schneider, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Herman L. Ekern, of Madison, Wis., and Winfield W. Gilman, of Milwaukee, Wis., for defendant in error Industrial Commission of Wisconsin.\n Mr. Lynn D. Jaseph, of Green Bay, Wis., for defendant in error McLaughlin.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit begun in the circuit court of Dane County, Wis., to review and set aside findings and award under the Wisconsin Workmen's Compensation Act of a death benefit in favor of Mary McLaughlin, as widow of William McLaughlin, against his employer, the Booth Fisheries Company, and that company's surety, the Zurich General Accident & Liability Company.\n The petition avers that the Industrial Commission, in making the award, acted without and in excess of its powers in finding that the personal injuries and death of William McLaughlin were proximately caused by accident, and not intentionally self-inflicted, and that this finding was contrary to the evidence and contrary to the law. The circuit court and the Supreme Court of the state held that the findings of fact by the commission were supported by evidence, and so were conclusive.\n The only question raised on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was the constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Wisconsin in its limitation of the judicial review of the findings of fact of the Industrial Commission to cases in which 'the findings of fact by the commission do not support the order or award.' Wisconsin Statutes 1921,  2394-19. This limitation has been held by the state Supreme Court to mean that the findings of fact \n\n[271 U.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n made by the Industrial Commission are conclusive, if there is any evidence to support them. Northwestern Iron Co. v. Industrial Commission, 154 Wis. 97, 142 N. W. 271, L. R. A. 1916A, 366, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 877; Milwaukee v. Industrial Commission, 160 Wis. 238, 151 N. W. 247; Milwaukee C. & G. Co. v. Industrial Commission, 160 Wis. 247, 151 N. W. 245; William Rahr Sons Co. v. Industrial Commission, 166 Wis. 28, 163 N. W. 169; Booth Fisheries Co. v. Industrial Commission, 185 Wis. 127, 200 N. W. 775. It follows that the court may not in its review weigh the evidence or set aside the finding on the ground that it is against the preponderance of the testimony.\n It is argued that the employer in a suit for compensation under the act is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to his day in court, and that he does not secure it unless he may submit to a court the question of the preponderance of the evidence on the issues raised\n A complete answer to this claim is found in the elective or voluntary character of the Wisconsin Compensation Act. That act provides that every employer who has elected to do so shall become subject to the act, that such election shall be made by filing a written statement with the commission, which shall subject him to the terms of the law for a year until July 1st following and to successive terms of one year unless he withdraws. Wisconsin Stat.  2394-3, 2394-4, 2394-5. It is conceded by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error that the act is elective, and that it is so is shown by the decisions of the Wisconsin court in Borgnis v. Falk Co., 147 Wis. 327, 350, 133 N. W. 209, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 489, and in the present case. 185 Wis. 127, 200 N. W. 775. If the employer elects not to accept the provisions of the Compensation Act, he is not bound to respond in a proceeding before the Industrial Commission under the act, but may await a suit for damages for injuries or wrongful death by the person claiming recovery therefor, and make his defense at law before a court in which the issues of fact and law are to be tried by jury. In view of such an op- \n\n[271 U.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n portunity for choice, the employer who elects to accept the law may not complain that in the plan for assessing the employer's compensation for injury sustained, there is no particular form of judicial review. This is clearly settled by the decision of this court in Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 \nU.S. 210, 216\n, 37 S. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637.\n More than this, the employer in this case having elected to accept the provisions of the law, and such benefits and immunities as it gives, may not escape its burdens by asserting that it is unconstitutional. The election is a waiver and estops such complaint. Daniels v. Tearney, \n102 U.S. 415\n; Grand Rapids & I. R. Co. v. Osborn, \n193 \nU.S. 17\n, 24 S. Ct. 310.\n The counsel for the plaintiff in error relies chiefly on the case of Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S. Ct. 527. That case does not apply. An order of a public service commission in fixing maximum rates for a water company was there attacked on the ground that the rates fixed were confiscatory. It was held that the law creating the commission, which had operated to withhold opportunity for appeal to the courts to determine the question, as a matter of fact and law, whether the rates were confiscatory, could not be sustained, and was in conflict with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in that case, the water company was denied opportunity to resort to a court to test the question of the confiscatory character of its rates and of its right to earn an adequate income. Here the employer was given an election to defend against a full court proceeding but accepted the alternative of the Compensation Act.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOWERS v. KERBAUGH-EMPIRE CO.(1926)\nNo. 173\nArgued: January 25, 1926Decided: May 3, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Attorney General and Mrs. Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[271 U.S. 170, 171]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Franklin Nevius, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error, a New York corporation, sued to recover $5,198.77 paid under protest on account of income taxes for 1921. Revenue Act 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 252, et seq. (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6336 1\/8 a et seq.).\n It owned all the capital stock of H. S. Kerbaugh, Incorporated, engaged in the performance of large construction contracts, and applied to the Deutsche Bank of Germany, \n\n[271 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n through its New York representative, for loans to finance the work being done by its subsidiary. The bank agreed that it would make the loans by cabling to the credit of its New York representative German marks equivalent in dollars to the requirements of defendant in error, upon condition that the loans would be evidenced by notes payable as to principal and interest in marks or their equivalent in United States gold coin at prime bankers' rate in New York for cable transfers to Berlin. June 8, 1911, defendant in error advised the New York representative of the amount in dollars then needed; he notified his principal and it put to his credit in a New York bank marks equivalent to the amount of money of the United States applied for. Then he drew his check payable in dollars against the credit and gave it to defendant in error, and in exchange received the promissory note of the latter payable in marks or their equivalent in gold coin of the United States. Prior to July 2, 1913, 24 loans were made in this manner, amounting in all to $1,983,000. The equivalent in marks was 8,341,337.50. September 1, 1913, there remained unpaid 6,740,800 marks. The notes of defendant in error then outstanding were surrendered and its new note for that amount was given. And when that note became due it was renewed. Partial payments were made and, by March 31, 1915, the principal was reduced to 3,216,445 marks.\n The several amounts from time to time borrowed by defendant in error were contemporaneously advanced to its subsidiary and were expended and lost in and about the performance of the construction contracts. These losses were sustained in 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917, and 1918, and were allowed as deductions in the subsidiary's income tax returns for those years. The excess of its losses over income was more than the amount here claimed by plaintiff in error to be income of defendant in error in 1921. \n\n[271 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n After the United States entered the War the Deutsche Bank was an alien enemy. In 1921, on the demand of the Alien Property Custodian, defendant in error paid him $113,688.23 in full settlement of principal and interest owing on the note belonging to the bank. Of that amount $80, 411.12 represented principal. The settlement was on the basis of 2 1\/2 cents per mark. Measured by United States gold coin the difference between the value of the marks borrowed at the time the loans were made and the amount paid to the Custodian was $684,456.18. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, notwithstanding the claim of defendant in error that the amount borrowed had been lost in construction operations carried on by it and its subsidiary, and that no income resulted from the transaction, held the amount to be income and chargeable to defendant in error for 1921. Excluding that item, the tax return for 1921 shows a deficit of.$581,254. 77.\n The defendant in error by its complaint set forth the facts above stated and asserted-as it still insists-that the diminution in value of the marks was not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, that the item in controversy is not within the Revenue Act, and that, if construed to include it, the act would be unconstitutional. Plaintiff in error moved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court denied the motion and gave judgment for defendant in error. Kerbaugh-Empire Co. v. Bowers (D. C.) 300 F. 938. This writ of error was taken under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), before the amendment of February 13, 1925. 43 Stat. 936, 938, c. 229.\n The question for decision is whether the difference between the value of marks measured by dollars at the time of payment to the Custodian and the value when the loans were made was income.\n The Sixteenth Amendment declares that Congress shall have power to levy and collect taxes on income, 'from \n\n[271 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n whatever source derived' without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration. It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had power to tax all incomes. But taxes on incomes from some sources had been held to be 'direct taxes' within the meaning of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment. Art. 1,  2, cl. 3,  9, cl. 4; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S. Ct. 912. The Amendment relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those that are not, and so put on the same basis all incomes 'from whatever source derived.' Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, 241 (60 L. Ed. 493, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713). 'Income' has been taken to mean the same thing as used in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909 (36 Stat. 112), in the Sixteenth Amendment, and in the various revenue acts subsequently passed. Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 38 S. Ct. 540; Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509, 219\n, 41 S. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305. After full consideration, this court declared that income may be defined as gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 415\n, 34 S. Ct. 136; Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, 38 S. Ct. 467; Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. And that definition has been adhered to and applied repeatedly. See, e. g., Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, supra, 518 (41 S. Ct. 386); Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527, 535\n, 41 S. Ct. 390; United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 169\n, 42 S. Ct. 63; Miles v. Safe Deposit Co., \n259 \nU.S. 247, 252\n, 253 S., 42 S. Ct. 483; United States v. Supplee-Biddle Co., \n265 \nU.S. 189, 194\n, 44 S. Ct. 546; Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 167\n, 45 S. Ct. 475; Edwards v. Cuba Railroad, \n268 \nU.S. 628, 633\n, 45 S. Ct. 614. In determining what constitutes income substance rather than form is to be given controlling weight. Eisner v. Macomber, supra, 206 (40 S. Ct. 189).\n\n\n[271 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n The transaction here in question did not result in gain from capital and labor, or from either of them, or in profit gained through the sale or conversion of capital. The essential facts set forth in the complaint are the loans in 1911, 1912, and 1913, the loss in 1913 to 1918 of the moneys borrowed, the excess of such losses over income by more than the item here in controversy, and payment in the equivalent of marks greatly depreciated in value. The result of the whole transaction was a loss.\n Plaintiff in error insists that in substance and effect the transaction was a 'short sale' of marks resulting in gain to defendant in error. But there is no similarity between what was done and such a venture. A short seller borrows what he sells, and the purchase price goes to the lender and is retained as security for repayment. The seller receives nothing until he repays the loan. Such a transaction would not meet the requirements of defendant in error. It needed the money for use and received the amount borrowed and expended it.\n The contention that the item in question is cash gain disregards the fact that the borrowed money was lost, and that the excess of such loss over income was more than the amount borrowed. When the loans were made and notes given, the assets and liabilities of defendant in error were increased alike. The loss of the money borrowed wiped out the increase of assets, but the liability remained. The assets were further diminished by payment of the debt. The loss was less than it would have been if marks had not declined in value; but the mere diminution of loss is not gain, profit, or income.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOYD v. U.S.(1926)\nNo. 365\nArgued: December 1, 1925Decided: April 19, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Sam E. Whitaker, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a prosecution under Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785, as amended by chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1130 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6287g et seq.). The indictment contained thirteen counts. The defendant was acquitted on seven and convicted on six, and the conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 4 F.(2d) 1014. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n\n[271 U.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n In each of the six counts the defendant was described as a physician, registered as such under the act, and credited with paying the special tax required of physicians, and was charged with unlawfully dispensing-through his written prescription-a stated quantity of morphine sulphate to a particular person, in the absence of a written order from the recipient on an authorized form, and not in the course of professional practice only, but to enable the recipient to obtain, as actually wad done, possession of that quantity of the drug contrary to law. The prescriptions as set forth were: To Annie Davis, an addict to the use of the drug for 21 years, 48 grains on August 2, 48 grains on August 9, and 40 grains on August 13, all in 1923; and to Frank O'Hara, an addict for 18 years, 30 grains on August 18, 30 grains on August 24, and 30 grains on August 30, all in 1923\n\n\n On the trial the government proved and the defendant admitted that he was a physician, was registered under the act, and had paid the special tax required of a physician; that he issued the prescriptions without written orders from the recipients on an authorized form; that he intended the recipients should obtain the during in the quantities specified from a local dealer; that they did so obtain it under the prescriptions; that they had been coming to the defendant for long periods, and he knew they were confirmed addicts, whose will had come to be subservient to their acquired craving for the drug; that they were in a position after the prescriptions were filled where they could administer the drug to themselves according to their own inclinations, or dispose of it to others; and that each prescription was for a quantity greatly in excess of what would be appropriate for immediate administration.\n The disputed question was whether the defendant issued the prescriptions in good faith, in the course of his professional practice. On this point the evidence was con- \n\n[271 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n flicting. That for the government tended strongly to show that the prescriptions were for quantities many times in excess of what, according to any fair medical standard, reasonably could be put into the possession of confirmed addicts, even when treating them for the addiction, or endeavoring to relieve them from suffering incident to it, and that the prescriptions could only have been issued to enable the recipients to indulge their acquired longing for the drug and its effects. Much of that for the defendant tended to show that he issued the prescriptions in good faith, in the course of professionally treating the recipients for their addiction, and endeavoring to relieve them from its incidents. But some of the evidence in his behalf was pronouncedly corroborative of that for the government. Thus the testimony of other physicians whom he called as witnesses, while tending to approve his asserted method of treatment, also tended to show that the prescriptions in question were grossly excessive and unreasonable, according to any fair medical standard; and his personal testimony contained contradictions and admissions tending materially to detract from his claim of good faith. Among other things, his testimony showed that he was both distributing and prescribing most unusual quantities of the drug; that he purchased and distributed over 15,000 grains from May 1 to September 30, 1923; and that he issued prescriptions on much the same scale during that period. There was much testimony that his professional and private character were good and widely respected.\n In its charge to the jury the court said that the determinative question was whether the defendant issued the prescriptions in good faith 'as a physician to his patients in the course of his professional practice only'; that, if they were issued in good faith, 'for the purpose of curing disease or relieving suffering,' he should be acquitted; and that if, on the evidence, that question was left in rea- \n\n[271 U.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n sonable doubt, he should be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted. There was more along this line, in the course of which the court said that it was admissible for the defendant in his professional practice to prescribe the drug either for 'the curing of morphinism,' or for 'the relief of suffering from morphinism,' if he did so in good faith, and that in determining the question of his good faith the jury should consider the quantity prescribed-whether it conformed to medical standards, and, if it was in excess of such standards, whether there was reason or occasion for the excess. Thus far the charge was in accord with what this court said in Linder v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 446, \n268 U.S. 5\n, 39 A. L. R. 229, where prior decisions were reviewed and explained.\n Further on in the charge the court indicated that it was not admissible for the defendant to issue prescriptions to a known addict 'for amounts of morphine for a great number of doses, more than was sufficient for the necessity of any one particular administration of it.' Complaint is now made of this. It appears ambiguous, and, if not taken with the rest of the charge, might be regarded as meaning that it never is admissible for a physician, in treating an addict, to give him a prescription for a greater quantity than is reasonably appropriate for a single dose or administration. So understood, the statement would be plainly in conflict with what this court said in the Linder Case. But we think it could not well have been so understood in this instance. It did not stand alone, but was to be taken in connection with what preceded it, and also with what followed. At the conclusion of the charge counsel for the defendant made no objection and took no exception to it, but simply asked the court to add the following, which was done:\n'I am requested to say to you, gentlemen, that in determining whether or not the defendant in prescribing morphine to his patients was honestly seeking to cure \n\n[271 U.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n them of the morphine habit, while applying his curative remedies, it is not necessary for the jury to believe that defendant's treatment would cure the morphine habit, but it is sufficient if defendant honestly believed his remedy was a cure for this disease.'\n\n'I instruct you that, if this is true, regardless of whether the course of treatment given by this defendant is a cure, the question is: Was he honestly and in good faith in the course of his professional practice and in an effort to cure disease issuing these prescriptions?'\n\n With that addition the charge elicited no criticism or objection from the defendant, although there was full opportunity therefor. It evidently was regarded as consistent and satisfactory. Besides, in view of what was said in other parts of the charge, we are justified in assuming that, had the court's attention been particularly drawn at the time to the part complained of now, it would have been put in better form. Certainly, after permitting it to pass as satisfactory then, the defendant is not now in a position to object to it. McDermott v. Severe, 26 S. Ct. 709, \n202 U.S. 600\n, 610; United States v. U. S.

St.  1218).\n Section 3466 provides:\n'Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.'\n\n Section 3467 (Comp. St.  6373) provides:\n'Every executor, administrator, or assignee, or other person, who pays any debt due by the person or estate from whom or for which he acts, before he satisfies and pays the debts due to the United States from such person or estate, shall become answerable in his own person and estate for the debts so due to \n\n[269 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n the United States, or for so much thereof as may remain due and unpaid.'\n\n It was admitted that the total value of the bank's assets was less than its debts, and that it was insolvent. Section 6221, Oregon Laws; National Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541,  1, 30 Stat. 544 (Comp. St.  9585). The lower courts rightly held that the amount owed by the bank on account of the deposit in question was a debt due to the United States.\n Appellee is entitled to priority if, within the meaning of section 3466, the bank made a voluntary assignment of its property or committed an act of bankruptcy.\n That section is to be liberally construed. In Beaston v. Farmers' Bank, 12 Pet. 102, at page 134 (9 L. Ed. 1017) Mr. Justice McKinley, speaking for the court, said: 'All debtors to the United States, whatever their character, and by whatever mode bound, may be fairly included within the language used ... And it is manifest, that congress intended to give priority of payment to the United States over all other creditors, in the cases stated therein. It therefore lies upon those who claim exemption from the operation of the statute, to show that they are not within its provisions. ... As this statute has reference to the public good, it ought to be liberally construed. United States v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29 (8 L. Ed. 308). As this question has been fully decided by this Court, other authorities need not be cited.' The Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9586-9656) does not give the United States priority as to debts, but that act does not apply to banks, and there has been no act of Congress indicating any change of purpose as to debts due from them to the United States. Cf. Davis v. Pringle, \n268 \nU.S. 315, 317\n, 318 S., 45 S. Ct. 549; Sloan Shipyards v. United States Fleet Corporation, \n258 \nU.S. 549, 574\n, 42 S. Ct. 386; Guarantee Co. v. Title Guaranty Co., \n224 \nU.S. 152, 158\n, 32 S. Ct. 457. There exist now the same reasons for a liberal construction of the priority act as when the rule was laid down.\n The act applies to all debts due from deceased debtors whenever their estates are insufficient to pay all cred- \n\n[269 U.S. 483, 488]\n\u00a0\n itors, and extends to all debts due from insolvent living debtors when their insolvency is shown in any of the ways stated in section 3466. The decisions of this court show that no lien is created by the statute; that priority does not attach while the debtor continues the owner and in possession of the property; that no evidence can be received of the insolvency of the debtor until he has been divested of his property in one of the modes stated; and that, 'whenever he is thus divested of his property, the person who becomes invested with the title, is thereby made a trustee for the United States, and is bound to pay their debt first out of the proceeds of the debtor's property.' Beaston v. Farmers' Bank, supra, 133, and cases cited; United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253, 259\n, 46 S. Ct. 295.\n Appellant, emphasizing the view that the priority act does not apply unless insolvency is manifested in one of the modes there indicated, contends that the resolution of the board of directors was not a voluntary assignment and did not divest the bank of the title; that, as the Bankruptcy Act does not apply to banks, there was no act of bankruptcy committed; that, under the state law, title remains in the bank after the superintendent takes possession and until he disposes of the property in the course of liquidation. And to support the last contention, he cites United States F. & G. Co. v. Bramwell, 108 Or. 261, 287, 217 P. 332, 32 A. L. R. 829. The question in that case was whether the state, as depositor in an insolvent bank taken over by the superintendent of banks, was entitled to priority as a sovereign right. The court held that it was; that its right was not defeated by the taking of the property by an administrative officer of the state before the state asserted its claim for priority; and that the bank's title was not divested until the assets were sold in the course of liquidation.\n The specified ways in which insolvency may be manifested include all cases in which an insolvent debtor makes \n\n[269 U.S. 483, 489]\n\u00a0\n an assignment of his property; there is no exception, and no regard is had to the purpose or manner of the assignment; and they include all cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed under the laws of a state or under a national bankruptcy law. Conard v. Nicoll, 4 Pet. 291, 307, 308; United States v. Oklahoma, supra, 262 (43 S. Ct. 295). The priority act does not expressly require that the insolvent debtor should be 'divested' or that the person on whom is imposed the duty to pay the United States first shall become 'invested' with the title. Appellant, arguing that such transfer of title is necessary, stresses general statements to that effect from opinions of this court. See United States v. Hooe, 3 Cranch, 73, 91; Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 1 Pet. 386, 439; Beaston v. Farmers' Bank, supra, 133, 136; United States v. Oklahoma, supra, 259 (43 S. Ct. 295). None involved the legal effect of acts similar to those presented here. It is a rule of universal application that general expressions used in a court's opinion are to be taken in connection with the case under consideration. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat, 264, 399. The language on which appellant relies was properly used in respect of the matters presented for decision in the cases cited by him. But, when the passages are read in the light of the facts considered and questions decided, they do not establish that the things done in this case did not in substance and effect amount to a voluntary assignment or to an act of bankruptcy.\n Section 3a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended February 5, 1903, 32 Stat. 797, c. 487 (Comp. St.  9587) provides:\n'Acts of bankruptcy by a person shall consist of his having ... (4) made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors, or, being insolvent, applied for a receiver or trustee for his property or because of insolvency a receiver or trustee has been put in charge of his property under the laws of a state, of a territory, or of the United States.'\n\n The fact that banks are not subject to that act \n\n[269 U.S. 483, 490]\n\u00a0\n is of no moment. The reference to an act of bankruptcy in section 3466 is general, and is for the purpose of defining one of the ways in which the debtor's insolvency may be manifested. The priority given does not depend on any proceeding under the bankruptcy laws of state or nation. There is nothing in the language of the section, and no reason has been suggested, to indicate a purpose to give priority in the case of a debt due the United States from a debtor subject to the Bankruptcy Act and to deny priority, under like circumstances, when the debt is due from an insolvent bank or other debtor to whom the act does not apply. The specification in section 3466 of the ways insolvency may be manifested is aided by the designation in section 3467 of the persons made answerable for failure to pay the United States first from the inadequate estates of deceased debtors or from the insolvent estates of living debtors. The persons held are 'every executor, administrator, or assignee, or other person.' The generality of the language is significant. Taken together, these sections mean that a debt due the United States is required first to be satisfied when the possession and control of the estate of the insolvent is given to any person charged with the duty of applying it to the payment of the debts of the insolvent, as the rights and priorities of creditors may be made to appear. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The statutes of the state (sections 6221-6223) provide for the handing over of the property of insolvent banks to the state superintendent of banks to be by him administered and disposed of for the benefit of creditors. By the resolution of the directors in this case, the bank was wholly divested of and business; and the exclusive possession and \n\n[269 U.S. 483, 491]\n\u00a0\n business; and the exclusive prossession and control of them passed to appellant for the purpose of liquidating the debts of the bank. And, under the state law, when he took possession of its assets, liens thereon, amounting in all to more than the value of the property, attached in favor of the depositors. Section 6220(h); Upham v. Bramwell, 105 Or. 597, 606- 609, 613, 209 P. 100, 210 P. 706, 25 A. L. R. 919. He was empowered, and it became his duty, to collect all debts and claims belonging to the bank, to sell its property under the direction of the court, and to execute and deliver to purchasers deeds and other instruments to evidence the passing of title to them; and, if necessary to pay the bank's debts, he was authorized to enforce the individual liability, if any, of the stockholders. And it was his duty, out of the estate, to pay expenses, and from time to time, as directed by the court, to apply the funds remaining in his hands to the payment of the bank's creditors according to their rights and priorities. United States F. & G. Co. v. Bramwell, supra, 288 ( 217 P. 332). After 60 days had elapsed the bank could not regain the property. Section 6223(c). The state law excludes all other methods for the liquidation of the debts of insolvent banks. Appellant's duties were in substance the same as those of a trustee having the legal title of property for the purpose of converting it into money to be paid over to specified persons. The state law required him to perform the functions of an assignee, receiver or trustee for the liquidation of the debts of an insolvent. See Sargent v. American Bank & Trust Co., 80 Or. 16, 26, 154 P. 759, 156 P. 431. Appellant had a power that for present purposes had the same effect as a title, and that is enough.\n The effect of the resolution of the bank directors is the same as if it expressly granted and imposed upon appellant all the powers and duties in respect of the bank's property and the liquidation of its debts that are specified in the state law. The resolution authorized and was followed by the handing over of the possession and control \n\n[269 U.S. 483, 492]\n\u00a0\n of all the bank's property to be converted into money to pay the bank's debts. The act of the directors made the bank's insolvency notorious. The established rule of liberal construction requires that the priority act be applied having regard to the public good it was intended to advance. Its application is not to be narrowly restricted to the cases within the literal and technical meaning of the words used. The things done in this case are not different in their substance from the things specified as the ways in which insolvency is required to be made manifest. It must be held that within the meaning of the priority act, the bank made a voluntary assignment of its property; and that, because of the bank's insolvency, a trustee was put in charge of its property under a state law within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

The conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Nith Circuit. 8 F. (2d) 472. This court granted certiorari. \n269 \nU.S. 550\n, 46 S. Ct. 201; Judicial Code,  240(a) as amended (Comp. St.  1217).\n The only errors assigned which are pressed upon us concern proceedings had upon the recall of the jury after its retirement. The jury having failed to agree after some hours of deliberation, the trial judge inquired how it was divided numerically, and was informed by the foreman that it stood nine to three, without indicating which number favored a conviction.\n In Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 307\n, 25 S. Ct. 243, 49 L. Ed 482, where a conviction was reversed on other grounds, this court condemned the practice of inquiring of a jury, unable to agree, the extent of its numerical division, although a response indicating the vote in favor of or against conviction was neither sought nor obtained. This court then said (page 308 (25 S. Ct. 250)):\n'... We do not think that the proper administration of the law requires such knowledge or permits such a question on the part of the presiding judge.'\n\n There is a diversity of view in the Circuit Courts of Appeals whether noncompliance with the rule as stated in the Burton Case is reversible error, or whether the expressions in that opinion are hortatory only. See St. Louis & S. F. R. R. v. Bishard (C. C. A. 8th), 147 F. 496, 78 C. C. A. 62; Stewart v. United States (C. C. A. 8th), 300 F. 769, 782 et seq.; Nigro v. United States (C. C. A. 8th), 4 F. \n\n[272 U.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n (2d) 781, holding that the inquiry requires a reversal. And compare Bernal v. United States (C. C. A. 5th), 241 F. 339, 342, 154 C. C. A. 219; Quong Duck v. United States (C. C. A. 9th), 293 F. 563, 564, supporting the view that the practice, while improper, is not prejudicial error.\n We deem it essential to the fair and impartial conduct of the trial that the inquiry itself should be regarded as ground for reversal. Such procedure serves no useful purpose that cannot be attained by questions not requiring the jury to reveal the nature or extent of its division. Its effect upon a divided jury will often depend upon circumstances which cannot properly be known to the trial judge or to the appellate courts and may vary widely in different situations, but in general its tendency is coercive. It can rarely be resorted to without bringing to bear in some degree, serious, although not measurable, an improper influence upon the jury, from whose deliberations every consideration other than that of the evidence and the law as expounded in a proper charge, should be excluded. Such a practice, which is never useful and is generally harmful, is not to be sanctioned.\n The failure of petitioners' counsel to particularize an exception to the court's inquiry does not preclude this court from correcting the error. Cf. Wiborg v. United States, \n163 U.S. 632\n, 658, et seq., 16 S. Ct. 1127, 1197; Clyatt v. United States, \n197 U.S. 207\n, 220, et seq., 25 S. Ct. 429; Crawford v.

This is especially the case where the error, as here, affects the proper relations of the court to the jury, and cannot be effectively remedied by modification of the judge's charge after the harm has been done.\n It is unnecessary to consider other assignments of error directed to the instructions given the jury at the time of its recall.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWNING v.

Moore, of Archer City, Tex., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 396, 400]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants own taxable real and personal property in that part of Archer county, Texas, defined as road district No. 2. The appellees are the county judge and four commissioners (constituting the county commissioners' court), the tax assessor, and the sheriff of the county, who is the tax collector. Appellants brought this suit to restrain the issue or sale of bonds of the road district in the amount of $300,000 proposed to be sold to obtain money for the construction, operation, and maintenance of roads in that district and to restrain the levy or collection of any tax upon their property to pay any part of the interest or principal of the bonds. They seek relief on the ground that the creation of the road district and the enforcement of the proposed tax will deprive them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the complaint. 3 F.( 2d) 160. The case is here on direct appeal. Section 238, Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1215).\n The Texas statutes (Complete Tex. St. 1920, or Vernon's Sayles' Ann. Civ. St. 1914, art. 627), provide: 'Any county ... or any political subdivision or defined district, now or hereafter to be described and defined, of a county,' is authorized to issue bonds, not to exceed one- fourth of the assessed valuation \n\n[269 U.S. 396, 401]\n\u00a0\n of real property in the district, for the construction, maintenance and operation of macadamized, graveled or paved roads and turnpikes, and to levy and collect taxes to pay them. Upon the petition of 50 resident property tax paying voters of any defined district of any county, it is the duty of the commissioners' court to order an election in the district as described in the petition to determine whether its bonds shall be issued for such road purposes, and whether a tax shall be levied upon the property of the district for their payment. Complete Tex. St. 1920, or Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Supp. 1918, art. 628. If two-thirds of the votes cast are in favor of the proposition, the commissioners' court is required to issue and sell the bonds. Complete Tex. St. 1920, or Vernon's Sayles' Ann. Civ. St. 1914, art. 631. But before they are put on the market, the court is required to levy a tax sufficient to pay the debt as it matures. The assessments are to be made on the same valuation, and they become liens and may be enforced in the same manner as state and county taxes. Articles 634, 2827, 2836. For the purposes of the act, any district accepting its provisions by such vote is thereby created a body corporate which may sue and be sued. Article 637.\n Archer county is about 30 miles square, and has a population of between 5,000 and 6,000. The principal place is Archer City, the county seat, located about 5 miles south and 3 miles east of the center of the county. Road district No. 2 embraces approximately the northerly half of the county, including a part of Archer City. The Ozark Trail is a federal aided state highway, and about 20 miles of it extends diagonally across the northwesterly part. Dundee is located on it about 2 miles from the west line of the county. There is a highway extending from that place to Diversion Dam about 6 miles northwest. About 18 miles of the Southwest Trail lies between Archer City and a point on the north line of the county about 6 miles from its northeast corner. There is another highway extending from a point \n\n[269 U.S. 396, 402]\n\u00a0\n on the Southwest Trail about 2 miles south of the county line to Holliday on the Ozark Trail about 6 miles west. These roads are within the road district, and the bonds issued are to raise money to improve them.\n January 17, 1924, there was presented to the commissioners' court a petition signed by 74 persons. It prayed an election to determine whether bonds of the territory, therein described by metes and bounds, and to be designated as 'Road District No. 2 of Archer County, Texas,' should be issued for road purposes in the amount of $300,000, and whether a tax should be levied upon the property therein to pay the bonds. The commissioners' court by order established the district within the metes and bounds and for the purposes set forth in the petition, and declared it to be a body corporate. On the same day the court fixed the time and place for an election. Its result was 303 votes for and 102 against the bond issue. Thereupon the court ordered the bonds to be issued, and levied the taxes. Before the election was called, the court determined that the proceeds of the bonds, if voted, or so much as might be necessary, should be expended for the roads above described.\n The appellants' lands-24,900 acres in all-are in the northeasterly part of the county. All but one of the petitioners are residents of the part of Archer City that is within the road district. Archer City, Dundee, and Holliday furnished 252 votes for the bond issue-more than twice the number cast against it. Nearly all the votes cast in the northeasterly part of the county were negative. The taxable property in the district is assessed at $5,683,359, of which $257,080 belongs to appellants, and $111, 388 to petitioners, and $60,500 of that amount belongs to one signer, leaving only $50,888 to the other 73. The part of the district in which appellants' lands are situated is tributary to Wichita Falls, which is outside Archer county, but near its northeast corner. The evi- \n\n[269 U.S. 396, 403]\n\u00a0\n dence persuasively supports appellants' contention that the improvements of the roads designated will not benefit their property. Moreover, the inclusion of their lands in that road district makes it impossible, until the last bonds mature, 30 years hence, to create another road district to raise money for the improvement of roads needed to serve the territory in which their lands are situated. Complete Tex. St. 1920, or Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Supp. 1922, art. 637d.\n Resort may be had to general taxes and to special assessments to raise funds for the construction or improvement of roads. Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Road District, \n266 \nU.S. 187, 190\n, 45 S. Ct. 31. The proceedings in this case cannot be sustained as the levy of a general tax. The commissioners' court is authorized to levy general taxes for road purposes up to a stated maximum on each $100 valuation. Complete Tex. St. 1920, or Vernon's Sayles' Ann. Civ. St. 1914, art. 2242; Const. Tex. art. 8,  9. The expenditure of the moneys so raised is not limited to any specified roads. And it is significant that, in the case of a road district, the court's duties in respect of the amount to be raised and the lands to be subjected to the charge are purely ministerial, and confined solely to carrying out the will of the petitioners when approved at the election. Here, on the initiation of individuals signing the petition, a special district was carved out to furnish credit and to pay for specified improvements on designated roads wholly within the territory selected. The purpose was special, and the district will cease to exist as a body corporate upon the payment of the bond debt. It is clear that the burdens here sought to be imposed on appellants' lands are special assessments for local improvements. Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242, 247\n, 36 S. Ct. 317; Illinois Central Railroad v. Decatur, \n147 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 209 S., 13 S. Ct. 293.\n The Legislature did not create the road district, levy the tax or fix the amount to be raised. Under the act, road \n\n[269 U.S. 396, 404]\n\u00a0\n districts are not required to correspond with or to include any political subdivision. Moore v. Commissioners' Court (Tex. Civ. App.) 175 S. W. 849; Bell County v. Hines (Tex. Civ. App.) 219 S. W. 556. There is nothing in the law to guide or to limit the action of the signers of the petition in selecting property to be assessed. Subject to the vote of a district of their own choice, the petitioners' designation is absolute. The commissioners' court has no power to modify or deny; it is bound to grant the petition. Huggins v. Vaden (Tex. Civ. App.) 253 S. W. 877, 878; Id. ( Tex. Civ. App.) 259 S. W. 204, 206; Meurer v. Hooper (Tex. Civ. App.) 271 S. W. 172, 176. And when the required vote is given, the court, once for all, must make a levy on the taxable property of the district sufficient to pay the entire debt as it matures. The opinion of the District Court states that the road district 'was composed of two of the precincts of Archer County-'political subdivisions of the county well recognized and ascertained long before the controversy.' We find nothing in the record to support the statement. But, if true, it does not tend to show that the Legislature created the road district. A political subdivision is not a 'defined district' within the meaning of the Texas Constitution (article 3 ,  52) or of the act. It has been held by the Texas Court of Civil Appeals that a 'defined district' means a defined area in a county, and less than a county, other than a political subdivision of a county. Bell County v. Hines, supra, 557. The fact that the metes and bounds describing the road district happened to coincide with the external boundaries of two adjoining commissioners' precincts does not support the contention that the road district was created by the Legislature. For the electior of commissioners, each county is divided into four precincts from each of which a commissioner is elected. These precincts are not defined by the Legislature, but by the commissioners' courts. Complete Tex. St. 1920, or Vernon's Sayles' Ann. Civ. St. 1914, art. 1356; Constitution Tex. art. \n\n[269 U.S. 396, 405]\n\u00a0\n 5,  18. They are political subdivisions, but, unlike road districts, they are not bodies corporate. See Ex parte Haney, 51 Tex. Cr. R. 634, 103 S. W. 1155; Cofield v. Britton, 50 Tex. Civ. App. 208, 109 S. W. 493, 496. They are not taxing or assessment districts; their powers and functions are wholly different from those of a road district. And plainly, the authority granted (article 627) to issue road bonds up to one-fourth the assessed valuation and to levy taxes ratably to pay them is not a legislative determination of the rate or amount of the tax imposed on appellants' property. The amount of the bonds to be issued and the property to be taxed are the elements which determine the burden. These were fixed by the petition and election. The Legislature may make assessments for local improvements ratably on the basis of the property valuation (Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester, \n261 \nU.S. 155\n, 43 S. Ct. 261); but, where the amount to be raised is determined and the property to be assessed is selected as in this case, the requirement that the burden shall be so spread is not a legislative assessment.\n Where a local improvement territory is selected, and the burden is spread by the Legislature, or by a municipality to which the state has granted full legislative powers over the subject, the owners of property in the district have no constitutional right to be heard on the question of benefits.

The petition was dismissed on demurrer, without opinion. 59 Ct. Cl. 972. The appeal was allowed in June, 1924\n\n\n The petition and an exhibit thereto disclosed that the claim was originally prosecuted in the War Department under the Dent Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 e), in various proceedings before the Ordinance Section of the Claims Board, the Board of Contract Adjustment,1 and the Appeal Section of the Claims Board,2 and that the Secretary of War made an award to the petitioner of $41,300.05, 'in full adjustment, payment, and discharge' of the contract, which was accepted by the petitioner, in writing, in 'full satisfaction of any and all claims or demands' which it had or might have pertaining to, growing out of, or incident to the contract.\n The petition sought to recover on the original contract, despite the settlement made more than three years before. It alleged, broadly, that this settlement was iniquitous and unjust, and not the voluntary act of the petitioner, but was secured by 'fraud' of the officers of the War Department in the handling of the claim, by 'continued brow-beating,' and by 'coercion' through which they 'literally forced' the petitioner to take the sum offered. \n\n[270 U.S. 347, 349]\n\u00a0\n The general allegations of 'fraud' and 'coercion' were mere conclusions of the pleader, and were not admitted by the demurrer. Fogg v. Blair, 11 S. Ct. 476, \n139 U.S. 118\n, 127. To show a cause of action it was necessary that the petition state distinctly the particular acts of fraud and coercion relied on, specifying by whom and in what manner they were perpetrated, with such definiteness and reasonable certainty that the court might see that, if proved, they would warrant the setting aside of the settlement. See Stearns v. Page, 7 How. 819, 829; Perkins-Campbell Co. v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 237, \n264 U.S. 213\n, 218; Cairo Railroad v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 247, \n267 U.S. 350\n, 352.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1905, this court affirmed a judgment of the Court of Claims for the principal of and the interest on four amounts due from the United States to the Cherokee \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n Nation. United States v. Cherokee Nation, 26 S. Ct. 588, \n202 U.S. 101\n; Id. 40 Ct. Cl. 252. The interest allowed in the judgment was 5 per cent. on the four claims from the accruing of liability to their payment. Since that judgment and its payment in full, the Cherokee Nation has presented to Congress the claim that more than simple interest was due, that the principal and interest due in 1895 should have been regarded as a lump sum, and that thereafter interest on the total at 5 per cent. to the time of payment should have been allowed. This, if granted, would be an additional sum of $2,216,091.76, with 5 per cent. interest from the dates of previous credits till paid. A special Act of Congress of March 3, 1919, 40 Stat. 1316, c. 103, provides in part as follows:\n'That jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court of Claims to hear, consider, and determine the claim of the Cherokee Nation against the United States for interest, in addition to all other interest heretofore allowed and paid, alleged to be owing from the United States to the Cherokee Nation on the funds arising from the judgment of the Court of Claims of May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five (Fortieth Court of Claims Reports, page two hundred and fifty-two), in favor of the Cherokee Nation. The said court is authorized, empowered, and directed to carefully examine all laws, treaties, or agreements, and especially the agreement between the United States and the Cherokee Nation of December nineteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, ratified by the United States March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-three (Twenty-seventh Statutes at Large, page six hundred and forty, section ten), in any manner affecting or relating to the question of interest on said funds, as the same shall be brought to the attention of the court by the Cherokee Nation under this act. And if it shall be found that under any of the said treaties, laws, or agreements interest on one or more of the said funds, either in whole or in part, \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n has not been paid and is rightfully owing from the United States to the Cherokee Nation, the court shall render final judgment therefor against the United States and in favor of the Cherokee Nation, either party to have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States as in other cases.'\n\n It is not necessary to recount the long and intricate history of the relations between the United States and the Cherokee Nation. It is complicated by the division between Cherokees into the Eastern Cherokees, who wished to become civilized and remain in the states east of the Mississippi, and those who preferred nomadic and hunting life in the West, and who first went to the Indian Territory and were called the Old Settlers. Ultimately the Eastern Cherokees were removed to the same place, and they and the Old Settlers were united in a common government again by the Treaty of 1846 (9 Stat. 871). The sale and purchase and transfer of lands east and west of the Mississippi, the distribution of these, the cost of removal of the various bands of the Nation to Indian Territory, and other transactions involving expense were the subject of discussion and dispute between the government and the Nation and its different bands. In avowed conformity with the Treaty of 1846, Congress appropriated in 1852, the sum of $724,603 'in full satisfaction and a final settlement of all claims and demands whatsoever of the Cherokee Nation against the United States.' 9 Stat. 573, c. 12. A full and final discharge was accordingly signed by the representatives of the Cherokee Nation, but under protest. Other claims, however, were thereafter made and paid, one of nearly $190,000 to the Old Settlers. Then in a case of The Old Settlers v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 1, affirmed by this court in 13 S. Ct. 650, \n148 U.S. 427\n, a judgment for $212,376.94 with interest from 1838 and an additional $4,100 was given them. \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n In 1889, the United States desired to buy from the Cherokees what was known as the Cherokee Outlet in Oklahoma, embracing 8,000,000 acres for settlement as public land. Under the authority of section 14 of the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 1005, an agreement was made December 19, 1891, by the United States with the Cherokee Nation, by the first article of which the Cherokee Nation agreed to convey to the United States, 8,144,682.91 acres between the 96th and 100th degree of west longitude, south of the Kansas line, and commonly known as the 'Cherokee Outlet.'\n The fourth article of the agreement was as follows:\n'Fourth. The United States shall, without delay, render to the Cherokee Nation, through any agent appointed by authority of the national council, a complete account of moneys due the Cherokee Nation under any of the treaties ratified in the years 1817, 1819, 1825, 1828, 1833, 1835, 1836, 1846, 1866, and 1868, and any laws passed by Congress of the United States for the purpose of carrying said treaties, or any of them, into effect; and upon such accounting should the Cherokee Nation, by its National Council, conclude and determine that such accounting is incorrect or unjust, then the Cherokee Nation shall have the right within twelve (12) months to enter suit against the United States in the Court of Claims, with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party, for any alleged or declared amount of money promised but withheld by the United States from the Cherokee Nation, under any of said treaties or laws, which may be claimed to be omitted from or improperly or unjustly or illegally adjusted in said accounting; and the Congress of the United States shall at its next session, after such case shall be finally decided and certified to Congress according to law, appropriate a sufficient sum of money to pay such judgment to the Cherokee Nation, should judgment be rendered in her \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n favor; or if it shall be found upon such accounting that any sum of money has been so withheld, the amount shall be duly appropriated by Congress, payable to the Cherokee Nation upon the order of its Antional Council, such appropriation to be made by Congress if then in session, and if not, then at the session immediately following such accounting.'\n\n The sixth article was in part as follows:\n'Sixth. That in addition to the foregoing enumerated considerations for the cession and relinquishment of title to the lands hereinbefore provided the United States shall pay to the Cherokee Nation, at such time and in such manner as the Cherokee National Council shall determine, the sum of eight million five hundred and ninety-five thousand seven hundred and thirty-six and twelve one-hundredths ($8, 595,736.12) dollars in excess of the sum of seven hundred and twenty- eight thousand three hundred and eighty-nine and forty-six one- hundredths ($728,389.46) dollars, the aggregate of amounts heretofore appropriated by Congress and charged against the lands of the Cherokees west of the Arkansas river, and also in excess of the amount heretofore paid by the Osage Indians for their reservation. So long as the money or any part of it shall remain in the Treasury of the United States after this agreement shall have become effective, such sum so left in the Treasury of the United States shall bear interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable semiannually: Provided, that the United States may at any time pay to said Cherokee Nation the whole or any part of said sum and thereupon terminate the obligation of the United States in respect to so much thereof as shall be so paid and in respect to any further interest upon the same.'\n\n On January 4, 1892, the agreement of 1891 was approved by the Cherokee National Council. The agreement was ratified by Congress by section 10 of the Act of March \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n 3, 1893 (27 Stat. 612, 640), which appropriated $295,736, to be immediately available and the remaining sum of $8,300,000 it was provided should be 'payable in five equal annual installments, commencing on the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, and ending on the fourth day of March, eighteen to bear interest at the rate of four per to bear interest at the rate of our per centum per annum, to be paid annually.'\n The act further provided that the acceptance by the Cherokee Nation of Indians of any of the money appropriated as therein set forth should be considered and taken and should operate as a full and complete relinquishment and extinguishment of all the title, claim, and interest in and to said lands of the Cherokee Nation.\n The sum of $5,000 was appropriated by the act to enable the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, 'to employ such expert person or persons to properly render a complete account to the Cherokee Nation of moneys due said Nation, as required in the fourth subdivision of article II of said agreement.'\n On May 17, 1893, a deed of cession was executed and delivered by the proper authorities of the Cherokee Nation to the United States and the first installment of the purchase money was paid to and accepted by the Cherokee Nation and the United States thereupon took possession of said lands, and thereafter disposed of the same. The other installments were duly and seasonably paid.\n In pursuance of the Act of March 3, 1893, supra, the Secretary of the Interior promptly employed two expert accountants, Messrs. James A. Slade and Joseph T. Bender, to prepare an account between the United States and the Cherokee Nation, and on April 28, 1894, they filed it with the Secretary. The amounts due the Cherokee Nation were summed up as follows: \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n\n Under the Treaty of 1819: Value of three tracts of land containing 1,700 acres at $1.25 per acre, to be added to the principal of the \"school\" fund $ 2,125 00 (With interest from February 27, 1819, to date of payment.) Under Treaty of 1835: Amount paid for removal of Eastern Cherokees to the Indian Territory, improperly charged to treaty fund $1,111,284 70 (With interest from June 12, 1838, to date of payment.) Under Treaty of 1866: Amount received by receiver of public moneys at Independence, Kan., never credited to Cherokee Nation $ 432 28 (With interest from January 1, 1874, to date of payment.) Under Act of Congress March 3, 1893: Interest on $15,000 of Choctaw funds applied in 1863 to relief of indigent Cherokees, said interest being improperly charged to Cherokee national fund $ 20,406 25 (With interest from July 1, 1893, to date of restoration of the principal of the Cherokee funds, held in trust in lieu of investments.)\n\n This was transmitted by the Secretary of the Interior to the proper authorities of the Cherokee Nation and it was accepted by act of the National Council approved December 1, 1894. It was then transmitted by the Secretary to Congress on January 7, 1895. The principal due on said account on March 4, 1895, was $1,134,248.23, and the interest was $3,162, 279.34.\n Instead of making an appropriation for this amount, Congress on March 2, 1895, referred the report of the Secretary of the Interior to the Attorney General and authorized and directed him to review the conclusions of law reached by the Department of the Interior in the account and report his conclusions at the next regular \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n session. 28 Stat. 795, c. 177. The Attorney General made his report December 2, 1895, which differed with the report of the Secretary of the Interior and the Slade and Bender report, holding that under the Treaty of 1846 and the settlement of 1852 by appropriation of Congress, the Cherokees were properly charged with the expense of removal and that the item 2 of $1,111,284.70 in the report was improperly charged to the United States. No action was taken in settlement of the matter by Congress until July 1, 1902, when by section 68 of the Act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 726) it referred the claims to the Court of Claims, as follows:\n'Jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court of Claims to examine, consider, and adjudicate, with a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by any party in interest feeling aggrieved at the decision of the Court of Claims, any claim which the Cherokee Tribe, or any band thereof, arising under treaty stipulations, may have against the United States, upon which suit shall be instituted within two years after the approval of this act; and also to examine, consider, and adjudicate any claim which the United States may have against said tribe, or any band thereof. ...'\n\n Under this act, the Cherokee Nation brought suit against the United States, claiming the whole amount with interest found due by the Slade and Bender account. Thereafter the Eastern Cherokees and the Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees each brought suit under the Act of July 1, 1902, as amended by the Act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. 996), against the United States, each claiming the removal fund of $1,111,284.70. The three suits were consolidated by order of the court, and were heard, considered, and decided together. The decree of the Court of Claims, in conformity with its opinion and conclusion of law entered March 20, 1905, was in part as follows: \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n 'It is, this 18th day of May, A. D. 1905, adjudged, ordered, and decreed that the plaintiff, the Cherokee Nation, do have and recover of and from the United States as follows:\n Item 1: The sum of $ 2,125 00 With interest therefrom at the rate of 5 per cent. from February 27, 1819, to date of payment. Item 2: The sum of $1,111,284 70 With interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent. from June 12, 1838, to date of payment. Item 3: The sum of $ 432 28 With interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent. from January 1, 1874, to date of payment. Item 4: The sum of $ 20,406 28 With interest thereon from July 1, 1903, to date of payment.\"\n\n Then followed directions as to the payment and distribution of the different items of the judgment. 40 Ct. Cl. 252, 363, 364.\n The case having come to this court on appeal, the judgment was affirmed on April 30, 1906, with a modification, consisting of a direction that item 2, $1,111,284.70, with interest at 5 per cent. from June 12, 1838, to date of payment, should be distributed among 'the Eastern Cherokees as individuals, whether east or west of the Mississippi, parties to the treaties of 1835-36 and 1846, and exclusive of Old Settlers.' United States v. Cherokee Nation, 26 S. Ct. 588, \n202 \nU.S. 101, 130\n, 131 S.. On May 28, 1906, the Court of Claims entered a decree modifying its original decree to conform to the mandate of the Supreme Court. In attempted satisfaction of the judgment of the Court of Claims, an modified by the Supreme Court, and as directed by subsequent appropriation acts, there has been paid to the Cherokee Nation the sum of $ 5,158,005.54.\n The Court of Claims held in the case before us that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any more interest and its petition was dismissed; hence this appeal.\n The first question for our consideration is the effect of the act of 1919 in referring the issue in this case to the \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n Court of Claims. The judgment of this court in the suit by the Cherokee Nation against the United States in March, 1905 (26 S. Ct. 588, \n202 U.S. 101\n), already referred to, awarded a large amount of interest. The question of interest was considered and decided, and it is quite clear that, but for the special act of 1919, above quoted, the question here mooted would have been foreclosed as res judicata. In passing the act, Congress must have been well advised of this, and the only possible construction therefore to be put upon it is that Congress has therein expressed its desire, so far as the question of interest is concerned, to waive the effect of the judgment as res judicata, and to direct the Court of Claims to re-examine it and determine whether the interest therein allowed was all that should have been allowed, or whether it should be found to be as now claimed by the Cherokee Nation. The Solicitor General, representing the government, properly concedes this to the correct view. The power of Congress to waive such an adjudication of course is clear. See Nock v. United States, 2 Ct. Cl. 451, Braden v. United States, 16 Ct. Cl. 389, and United States v. Grant, 3 S. Ct. 585, \n110 U.S. 225\n. Compare United States v. Realty Co., 16 S. Ct. 1120, \n163 U.S. 427\n; Allen v. Smith, 19 S. Ct. 446, \n173 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 402 S.; United States v. Cook, 42 S. Ct. 200, \n257 U.S. 523\n, 527; Work v. United States ex rel. Rives, 45 S. Ct. 252, \n267 U.S. 175\n, 181; Mitchell v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 293, \n267 U.S. 341\n, 346.\n There is nothing before us which indicates that the present claim for a rest in the matter of interest in 1895, was presented either to the Court of Claims or to this court. It is a new argument not before considered. The argument is that the consideration for the land to be conveyed under the agreement of 1891 was not only the $8,500,000 to be paid, but also the appropriation by Congress of money to pay the old accounts long due, and that the failure of Congress to make the appropriation at the time agreed required that interest \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 487]\n\u00a0\n thereafter should be awarded upon the lump sum of principal and interest as of that date, in full payment of the purchase money for the land. The claim is that the failure of Congress to make the appropriation as stipulated in the contract became a new terminus a quo from which the calculation of interest on everything then due and owing must be calculated.\n In taking up this argument, we should begin with the premise, well established by the authorities, that a recovery of interest against the United States is not authorized under a special act referring to the Court of Claims a suit founded upon a contract with the United States unless the contract or the act expressly authorizes such interest. This is in accord with the general congressional policy as shown in section 177 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1168), providing that no interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest. Tillson v. United States, \n100 U.S. 43\n, 46; Harvey v. United States, 5 S. Ct. 465, \n113 U.S. 243\n, 249.\n We have already held, in The Old Settlers Case, supra, and in United States v. Cherokee Nation, supra, that in the past financial dealings between the United States and the Cherokee on debts due from the former to the latter, interest at 5 per cent. until payment was to be allowed as if stipulated. This result followed from a decision by the Senate of the United States acting as umpire between the two parties in 1850. In that capacity it adopted the following resolution:\n'Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum should be allowed upon the sums found to be due to the Eastern and Western Cherokees respectively, from the 12th day of June, 1838, until paid.'\n\n Thus it was that the accountants Slade and Bender reported that interest at 5 per cent. until paid should \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 488]\n\u00a0\n be allowed the Cherokees, not only on the items which were due in 1850, but also on those which had accrued since, and, by the ratification of their report by both parties, interest thus calculated becomes a stipulated term in respect of the issue before us.\n It is contended, however, by counsel for the Cherokee Nation, that the decision of this court in 1906 so treats the breach of the contract by the government in failing to make the appropriation in 1895 as to justify the claim that it was more than a mere continuance of the failure to pay; that it was a new breach of a new contract, requiring interest as upon a new default in a new debt of the sum total of the original claim, with interest added down to 1895\n\n\n We cannot ascribe such an effect of the decision referred to. The chief controversy in that case was as to the liability of the government at all for the removal expenses of the Eastern Cherokees. It was argued on its behalf, as the report of the case in the Court of Claims shows (40 Ct. Cl. 252, 307), that Slade and Bender were merely accountants employed by the government to state the account, and not to pass on the legal validity and effect of the Treaty of 1846 and the scope of the settlement evidenced by the appropriation and the signed releases of 1852; that the Cherokees were not bound by the report as an account stated or settled, but were given full right by the agreement of 1891 to contest its correctness and to resort to court in respect to it; and that the government could not be bound by such a report, in which the accountants exceeded their authority as mere accountants, and exercised their functions as if authorized to act as arbitrators or umpires. This court stated its adverse conclusion on this point, by quoting and approving the language of Chief Justice Nott in the Court of Claims (26 S. Ct. 588, 597, \n202 U.S. 101\n, at pages 122, 123), as follows:\n'The court does not intend to imply that when the account of Slade and Bender came into the hands of the \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 489]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Interior he was bound to transmit it to the Cherokee Nation. On the contrary, the Cherokee Nation had not agreed to be bound by the report of the accountants and could not claim that the United States should be. The accountants were but the instrumentality of the United States in making out an account. When it was placed in the Interior Department it was as much within the discretion of the Secretary to accept and adopt it or to remand it for alterations and corrections as a thing could be. He was the representative of the United States under whom the agreement had been made, and he was the authority under which the account had been made out, and when he transmitted it to the Cherokee Nation his transmission was the transmission of the United States. When the account was thus received by the Cherokee Nation (May 21, 1894), the 'twelve months' of the agreement, within which the Nation must consider it and enter suit against the other party in the Court of Claims, began to run, and with the Nation's acceptance of the account (December 1, 1894) the session of Congress at which and appropriation should be made became fixed and certain. The Secretary did not recall the account; the United States never rendered another, and the utmost authority which Congress could have exercised, if any, was, at the same session, or certainly within the prescribed 'twelve months,' to have directed the Secretary to withdraw the account and notify the Cherokee Nation that another would be rendered. The action of the Secretary of the Interior, combined with the inaction of Congress to direct anything to the contrary, makes this provision of the agreement final and conclusive. The Cherokee Nation has parted with the land, has lost the time within which it might have appealed to the courts, and has lost the right to bring the items which it regards as incorrectly or unjustly disallowed to judicial arbitrament, and the United States are placed in the position of having broken and evaded the letter and spirit of their agreement.' \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 490]\n\u00a0\n All this, however, was directed to the question of the liability of the United States to pay the principal debt. The court then proceeded to find the interest due as directed in the Slade and Bender account without any suggestion of a rest for interest in 1905, or anything other than simple interest at 5 per cent. until paid.\n\n When we consider the rule requiring an express provision of contract or statute to justify the imposition of interest in adjudicating any claim against the United States, we can find nothing in the circumstances of this case to increase the interest as adjudged. The additional interest now claimed is sought really as damages for the delay of Congress in appropriating the sum due in 1895 as the United States promised in the 1891 agreement. But the rule as to interest against the United States does not allow us to adjudge interest as damages at all. Congress must expressly provide for it or the contract must so provide. The only contractual obligation here is for simple 5 per cent. interest until payment.\n What the appellant here seeks is compound interest; that is, interest on interest from 1895 until now. The general rule, even as between private persons, is that, in the absence of a contract therefor or some statute, compound interest is not allowed to be computed upon a debt. Whitcomb v.

Folsom, 50 N. E. 523, 171 Mass. 188, 192; Wallace v. Glaser 46 N. W. 227, 82 Mich. 190, 21 Am. St. Rep. 556; Blanchard v. Dominion National Bank, 108 S. E. 649, 130 Va. 633, 637, 27 A. L. R. 78; Finger v. McCaughey, 45 P. 1004, 114 Cal. 64, 66; Cullen v. Whitham, 74 P. 581, 33 Wash. 366, 368. In view of the care with which Congress and this court, in interpretation of the legislative will, have limited the collection of simple interest against the government, a fortiori must compound interest be denied to appellant, unless provision therefor is made in the contract of 1891, or in the statute \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 491]\n\u00a0\n of 1919 authorizing this suit, and it is to be found in neither.\n Further support for the claim of the appellant is said to be found in the sixth article of the agreement, quoted above, in the language, 'so long as the money or any part of it shall remain in the Treasury of the United States after this agreement shall have become effective, such sums so left in the Treasury of the United States shall bear interest at rate of 5 per cent. per annum, payable semiannually.' It is said that this should be construed to refer not only to the balance unpaid of the $8,595, 736.12 but also to the money on the old claims found to be due under the agreement, because payment of the latter was part of the consideration for the land. A careful examination of the sixth article shows that this clause referred only to the new money consideration to be paid, and really only to the part of that which, after it fell due and was ready for payment, should be voluntarily left in the Treasury by the Cherokee Nation. It did not even refer to the originally deferred payments because those payments were to bear only four per cent. interest. In any view, it did not and could not refer to amounts due on past account, because at the time the agreement of 1891 was made they were not fixed in amount and awaited a possible adjudication to determine them, and full treatment of them was given in article 4 of the agreement. The sixth article did not apply to them at all.\n It is further argued that the payment of compound interest is to be supported here under the provisions of the Treaty of July 19, 1866, 14 Stat. 799, 805, art. 23, which reads as follows:\n'All funds now due the Nation, or that may hereafter accrue from the sale of their lands by the United States as hereinbefore provided for, shall be invested in United States registered stocks at their current value, and the interest on all said funds shall be paid semiannually on the order of the Cherokee Nation.' \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 492]\n\u00a0\n And by section 3659 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. s 6667) re- enacting section 2 of the Act of Congress of September 11, 1841, 5 Stat. 465, which provides:\n\n'All funds held in trust by the United States, and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise required by treaty, shall be invested in stocks of the United States, bearing a rate of interest not less than five per centum per annum.'\n\n It is urged that the largest itme of $1,114,000 was taken out of a $5, 000,000 trust fund held by the United States for the benefit of the Cherokees, and therefore that it should be treated as if it were always in the Treasury of the United States, held in trust for the Indians, and as if the United States had collected the interest thereon out of the invested stocks, and had refused to pay it over as annuities to the Indians. This claim proves too much. It would require compound interest brought about by annual or semiannual rests for near a century, on amount that the Solicitor General suggests would be equal to the national debt. The argument is shown to be wholly without support in the circumstance that the Cherokees and the United States, by the resolution of the Senate in 1850, agreed upon the interest for such debts as that of 5 per cent. until paid. Moreover the ratification by the Cherokees of the Slade and Bender report foreclosed any such claim.\n After the judgment was rendered in 1906 by this court, affirming that of the Court of Claims, the Treasury had some difficulty in deciding how the interest was to be calculated on the amounts declared in the judgment. We have no doubt that the judgment should have been paid in accordance with its exact terms, namely, with simple interest down to the time of actual payment, and that the intervention of the judgment of 1906 made no difference in the calculation of the interest. This is the necessary effect of the judgment. \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 493]\n\u00a0\n The Treasury was troubled by the provision of Act Sept. 30, 1890, 26 Stat. 504, 537, s 1 (Comp. St. s 6406), which provides as follows:\n'That hereafter it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to certify to Congress for appropriation only such judgments of the Court of Claims as are not to be appealed, or such appealed cases as shall have been decided by the Supreme Court to be due and payable. And on judgments in favor of claimants which have been appealed by the United States and affirmed by the Supreme Court, interest, at the rate of four per centum per annum, shall be allowed and paid from the date of filing the transcript of judgment in the Treasury Department up to and including the date of the mandate of affirmance by the Supreme Court: Provided, that in no case shall interest be allowed after the term of the Supreme Court at which said judgment was affirmed.'\n\n It is quite clear that the statute applies where judgment against the United States bear no interest, and certainly not to one in which the judgment itself provides for a certain rate of interest after its entry. The above statute was framed in order to impose a penalty on the United States for its unsuccessful effort by appeal to defeat the judgment against it. It only allows interest pending the appeal from the date of filing the transcript in the Treasury Department to the date of the mandate of affirmance. The Treasury Department seems to have applied this statute with respect to all the four items of the judgment of 1906.\n By the Act of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 634, 664, Congress made appropriation for the payment of the judgment of the Court of Claims, principal and interest, as follows:\n'To pay the judgment rendered by the Court of Claims on May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five, in consolidated causes numbered twenty-three thousand one hundred and ninety-nine, The Cherokee Nation versus \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 494]\n\u00a0\n the United States; numbered twenty-three thousand two hundred and fourteen. The Eastern Cherokees versus The United States; and numbered twenty-three thousand two hundred and twelve, The Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees versus The United States, aggregating a principal sum of one million one hundred and thirty-four thousand two hundred and forty-eight dollars and twenty-three cents, as therein set forth, with interest upon the several items of judgment at five per centum, one million one hundred and thirty-four thousand two hundred and forty-eight dollars and twenty-three cents, together with such additional sum as may be necessary to pay interest, as authorized by law.'\n\n This act was further amended by the Act of March 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 907, 938, 939, as follows:\n'That the general deficiency appropriation act of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and six, so far as the same provides for the payment of item two of the judgment of the Court of Claims of May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five, in favor of the Eastern Cherokees, shall be so construed as to carry interest on said item two up to such time as the roll of the individual beneficiaries entitled to share in said judgment shall be finally approved by the Court of Claims, and for the payment of said interest a sufficient sum is hereby appropriated.'\n\n Then by section 18 of the Act of June 30, 1919, 41 Stat. 3, 21, Congress provided for the payment of certain interest on items 1 and 4 of the judgment. The provision in this section as to item 1 seems to have been largely an overpayment. That as to item 4 seems also to have involved a considerable overpayment though it also included 10 years' interest due on the principal under the judgment which by the government's error was not embraced in the payment under the act of 1906.\n The sum of all payment actually made under the judgment of 1905 was as follows: \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 495]\n\u00a0\n On July 2, 1906, to the Secretary of the Interior on account of said item 1 $ 11,520 46 On the same date on account of item 3 1,140 49 On the same date on account of item 4 23,294 93 On July 14, 1906, to the attorneys for the Eastern Cherokees and the Eastern Emigrant Cherokees, fees amounting to 740,555 42 On November 3, 1906, to the attorneys for the Cherokee Nation on account of item 2, fees amounting to 148,245 15 On various dates after July 2, 1906, and before final distribution of the fund arising from item 2, to Guion Miller for fees and expenses the sum of 103,749 74 On and after March 15, 1910, to Guion Miller for per capita distribution among the Cherokees entitled to share in the fund the sum of 4,105,810 77 On or about August 7, 1919, additional interest on item 4, pursuant to the Act of June 30, 1919 21,502 86 On or about August 7, 1919, to the Secretary of the Interior as additional interest on item 1, pursuant to the said Act of June 30, 1919 2,185 72 ___\n Making a total sum, principals and interest of $5,158,005 54\n\n The delay in the payment of the largest ites was due to the desire to comply with the ruling of the Court of Claims, concurred in by this court, that the money of the large claim should be distributed to the individual members of the Eastern Cherokees according to rolls to be made up of those individuals. 40 Ct. Cl. 332; 26 S. Ct. 588, \n202 U.S. 119\n, 130. This is what led to the amendment of 1909.\n It is quite clear that the mistake made by the Treasury, and by Congress, too, in attempting to carry out the judgment of this court, was in assuming first that 4 per cent. should be allowed on the total of all items and interest between the date of filing the transcript of the judgment in the Treasury Department and the date of the mandate of arrirmance by the Supreme Court, as already pointed out. A further mistake was made in calculating interest at 5 per cent. after the date of affirmance by this court on the total of the judgment and the interest until final \n\n[270 U.S. 476, 496]\n\u00a0\n payment. It should have been confined to interest on the principal sums. The eighth finding of the Court of Claims shows in more or less detail how the interest was calculated. The methods adopted we have already criticized. The Solicitor General in his brief makes it evident that in the case of no one of the four items is the amount which has been actually paid less than that which should have been paid down to the day of payment, in accordance with the judgment, including the principal and 5 per cent. simple interest to the date of payment. There is no attempt on the part of the appellant to question the demonstration of this fact. The truth is that the errors in the calculation increased by a substantial sum the amounts which under the judgment should have been paid. As this was more favorable than it should have been to the Cherokees, they can not complain. On this appeal, under the act of 1919, and in compliance with its requirement, we hold that there is no more interest due to the Cherokees beyond that which they have already received. The government is not in a position, in view of the fact that the errors referred to have been embodied in legislation, and the overpayments have been made by direction of Congress, to seek to recover them back. Indeed it has not attempted to do so.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO. v. A. F. THOMPSON MFG. CO.(1926)\nNo. 178\nArgued: January 27, 1926Decided: March 8, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 416, 417]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. N. Davis and C. W. Strickling, both of Huntington, W. Va., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 416, 418]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry Simms and Lewis A. Staker, both of Huntington, W. Va., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 416, 419]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, a corporation, brought suit in the circuit court of Cabell county, W. Va., to recover from petitioner, a common carrier, for damage to an interstate shipment of goods. The case was twice tried. See Thompson Manufacturing Co. v. Railroad, 115 S. E. 877, 93 W. Va. 3. The second trial before a jury resulted in a judgment for the respondent, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, 123 S. E. 421, 99 W. Va. 670. This court granted certiorari. 45 S. Ct. 352, \n267 U.S. 588\n; Judicial Code, s 237 (Comp. St. s 1215). \n\n[270 U.S. 416, 420]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner supplied respondent, at its request, with two box cars for the transportation of a quantity of sheet iron gas stoves in carload lots from Huntington, W. Va., to Kansas City, Mo. The stoves were shipped by respondent in good condition on interstate bills of lading purporting to exempt the carrier from liability unless claims for damage 'be made in writing to the carrier within four months after delivery of the property.' Upon arrival many of the stoves were found to be damaged by rust and unsalable. Respondent brought the present suit more than four months after the delivery of the stoves, setting up in its amended declaration that the damage was caused by the negligent conduct of the petitioner. At the trial the respondent made no attempt to show compliance with the requirement of the bill of lading for written notice of its claim to the carrier, and relied wholly on proof of the delivery of the stoves to the carrier in good condition and the delivery by the carrier at destination in a damaged condition, to establish its right to recover. Petitioner proved that the cars supplied were in weather-tight condition, that after the goods were loaded on the cars they were sealed at the point of shipment, and that they arrived at destination in the same weather-tight condition, with seals unbroken.\n The case turns on the meaning and application, in the circumstances, of the last proviso of the so-called Cummins Amendment. Act of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1196, 1197, c. 176, amending the Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, as amended by section 7 of the Act of June 29. 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 593 (Comp. St. ss 8592, 8604a). The last two provisos of the act, as construed in Barrett v. Van Pelt, 45 S. Ct. 437, \n268 U.S. 85\n, read as follows:\n'Provided further, that it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days and for the filing of claims for a \n\n[270 U.S. 416, 421]\n\u00a0\n shorter period than four months, and for the institution of suits than two years: Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded or damage in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.'\n\n If respondent does not bring the case within the terms of the final proviso, its failure to give written notice of claim will bar it from recovery. See Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Co., 36 S. Ct. 541, \n241 U.S. 190\n; Barrett v. Van Pelt, supra; Davis v. Roper Lumber Co., 46 S. Ct. 28, \n269 U.S. 158\n.\n It was argued by petitioner in the state court, as it argues here, that, as respondent offered no direct evidence that the damage to the goods in transit was caused by negligence of petitioner, respondent did not show compliance with the requirements of the Cummins Amendment for relieving the shipper from the necessity of filing its claim in writing with the carrier. On the other hand, it is argued by the respondent that every carrier receiving goods for carriage in good condition, and returning them in bad condition, is conclusively presumed to have been negligent, and is liable for the damage resulting from its negligence, unless the injury was caused by the act of God, the public enemy, or the act of the shipper or the nature of the goods themselves; that, as the evidence and the verdict of the jury established that the damage was not due to any of these causes, the carrier's negligence was to be conclusively presumed, and no notice of claim was necessary under the provisions of the Cummins Amendment.\n It is sometimes said that the basis of the carrier's liability for loss of goods or for their damage in transit is 'presumed negligence.' Hall & Long v. Railroad Companies, 13 Wall. 367, 372. But the so-called presumption \n\n[270 U.S. 416, 422]\n\u00a0\n is not a true presumption, since it cannot be rebutted, and the statement itself is only another way of stating the rule of substantive law that a carrier is liable for a failure to transport saferier goods intrusted to its care, unless the loss or damage was due to one of the specified causes. See Railroad Co. v. Reeves, 10 Wall. 176, 189; Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 7 Wall. 357, 376; Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Express Co., \n93 U.S. 174\n, 181.\n We do not consider that the phrase 'carelessness or negligence' of the carrier, as used in the Cummins Amendment in exempting shippers from giving written notice of a claim for damage, has any reference to the conclusive 'presumption' to which we have referred. If such were the meaning of the statute, every case of carrier's liability for damage in transit would be a case of presumed negligence, and proof of written notice of claim for damage required by the bill of lading would always be dispensed with, and the plain purpose of the amendment would be defeated. We think that by the use of the words 'carelessness or negligence,' it was intended to relieve the shipper from the necessity of making written proof of claim when, and only when, the damage was due to the carrier's actual negligent conduct, and that by carelessness or negligence is meant not a rule of liability without fault, but negligence in fact. See Barrett v. Van Pelt, supra.\n There is no language in the statute from which a purpose may be inferred to vary or limit the common-law rules governing proof of negligence as a fact in issue, and the shipper may follow these rules when he seeks to show that no notice of claim was necessary.\n The respondent therefore had the burden of proving the carrier's negligence as one of the facts essential to recovery. When he introduced evidence to show delivery of the shipment to the carrier in good condition and its delivery to the consignee in bad condition, the petitioner became subject to the rule applicable to all bailees, that \n\n[270 U.S. 416, 423]\n\u00a0\n such evidence makes out a prima facie case of negligence. Miles v. International Hotel Co., 124 N. E. 599, 289 Ill. 320; Miller v. Miloslowsky, 133 N. W. 357, 153 Iowa, 135; Dinsmore v. Abbott, 36 A. 621, 89 Me. 373; Railroad Co. v. Hughes, 47 So. 662, 94 Miss. 242, 246, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 975; Hildebrand v. Carroll, 82 N. W. 145, 106 Wis. 324, 80 Am. St. Rep. 29. The effect of the respondent's evidence was, we think, to make a prima facie case for the jury. See Sweeney v. Erving, 33 S. Ct. 416, \n228 U.S. 233\n, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 905; Hanes v. Shapiro, 84 S. E. 33, 168 N. C. 34, 35; Sims v. Roy, 42 App. D. C. 496, 499. But, even if this 'prima facie case' be regarded as sufficient, in the absence of rebutting evidence, to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict (Buswell v. Fuller, 36 A. 1059, 89 Me. 600, 602, 603; Cogdell v. Railroad, 44 S. E. 618, 132 N. C. 852), the trial court erred here in deciding the issue of negligence in favor of the plaintiff as a matter of law. For the petitioner introduced evidence of the condition of the cars from the time of shipment to the time of arrival, which persuasively tended to exclude the possibility of negligence.\n The trial court properly submitted to the jury the question whether the damage was due to an act of God or the public enemy or to the inherent condition of the stoves, since upon the answer to it depended the liability of the carrier provided the shipper was entitled, under the Cummins Amendment, to maintain suit without giving the stipulated notice. But the court erroneously instructed the jury that if they found that the damage was not due to these causes, they might return a verdict for the respondent, thus, in effect, resolving the issue of negligence in favor of the respondent.\n The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO. v. NIXON(1926)\nNo. 306\nArgued: May 3, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. S. H. Williams, Randolph Harrison, and A. R. Long, all of Lynchburg, Va., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Duncan Drysdale and Aubrey E. Strode, both of Lynchburg, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover damages for the death of the plaintiff's husband, the interstate, from the Railroad Company upon whose tracks the death occurred. The plaintiff (the respondent here) obtained a verdict and \n\n[271 U.S. 218, 219]\n\u00a0\n judgment in the trial Court and upon a writ of error the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. 140 Va. 351, 125 S. E. 325. As the recovery was based upon the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657), the death having occurred in interstate commerce, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court to review certain questions of law that arose in the case. \n267 \nU.S. 590\n, 45 S. Ct. 508.\n The deceased was an experienced section foreman upon the defendant's road. One of his duties was to go over and examine the track and to keep it in proper repair. When inspecting the track he used a three wheeled velocipede that fitted the rails and was propelled by the feet of the user. He had obtained from his immediate superior, the Supervisor of Track, leave to use the machine also in going to his work from his house, about a mile distant, over a part of the track that was in his charge. His work began at 7 in the morning and at half past 6 on the day of his death he started as usual. Five minutes later he was overtaken by a train and killed. For reasons that the jury found insufficient to excuse the omission the engineer and fireman of the train were not on the lookout, and the question raised is whether as toward the deceased the defendant owed a duty to keep a lookout, or whether on the other hand the deceased took the risk.\n If the accident had happened an hour later when the deceased was inspecting the track, we think that there is no doubt that he would be held to have assumed the risk, and to have understood, as he instructed his men, that he must rely upon his own watchfulness and keep out of the way. The Railroad Company was entitled to expect that self-protection from its employees. Aerkfetz v. Humphreys, \n145 \nU.S. 418\n, 12 S. Ct. 835; Boldt v. Pennsylvania R. R.

The duty of the railroad company toward this class of employees was not affected by that which it might owe to others.\n The permission to use the velocipede in going to his work did not make the defendant's obligation to the deceased greater than it would have been after he got there. We assume that it was as effective to make the use of the car lawful as would have been a stockholder's vote spread upon the records of the company. But the implications are not necessarily the same. It was a trifling incident of daily life by which a subordinate officer of the company allowed one lower in grade to enlarge his customary use of the machine by an hour for his own convenience, although even then, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, already engaged in his duties. It seems to us to have been no more than an extension of his ordinary rights and his usual risks.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO. v.

Gay. all of Richmond, Va., for respondent.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 260, 265]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These actions were brought in a state court of Virginia to recover amounts alleged to be due for the use of an engine and crew rented or assigned by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company to Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Co., Inc., under a contract made in September, 1917. The latter corporation was engaged in construction work for the government on premises at Newport News connected by industrial tracks with the railway's main line. Owing to war conditions, there was then serious congestion of traffic at Newport News, and the railway failed duly to perform spotting service for the company. To remedy this condition the engine and crew were assigned to the exclusive use of its traffic, payment to be made therefor as prescribed in the contract. The use continued from that date until April, 1918. The railway sued for the period prior to December 28, 1917; the Director General for that later. The defenses were want of consideration and that the contract was void, because it violated the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St. s 8563 et seq.) and a similar law of the state. A judgment for the defendant, entered in each case by the trial court, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals on the ground of want of consideration. 123 S. E. 352, 138 Va. 647. This court granted writs of certiorari. 45 S. Ct. 98, \n266 U.S. 598\n. No question under the state law is before us.\n The service of spotting cars was included in the line haul charge under both interstate and state tariffs. The railway contends that under the tariffs no obligation rested upon the carrier either to furnish spotting service solely for the convenience of a shipper or to furnish him special facilities to meet abnormal and unprecedented conditions; that the contract was, therefore, not without consideration; and that, being for rental of equipment, it was not for a common carrier service and, hence, a contract therefor was legal under the Interstate Commerce \n\n[270 U.S. 260, 266]\n\u00a0\n Act, although no tariff provided for the charges. The service by special engine and crew contracted for and given was not spotting solely for the convenience of the shipper. It was the spotting service covered by the tariff. Compare Car Spotting Charges, 34 Interst. Com. Com'n. R. 609; Downey Ship-Building Corp. v. Staten Island Rapid Transit Ry. Co., 60 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 543. It is true that abnormal conditions may relieve a carrier from liability for failure to perform the usual transportation services, but they do not justify an extra charge for performing them. The carrier is here seeking compensation in excess of the tariff rate for having performed a service covered by the tariff. This is expressly prohibited by the Interstate Commerce Act. Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, s 6(7), 24 Stat. 379, 381 as amended (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 8569). A contract to pay this additional amount is both without consideration and illegal. It is no answer that by virtue of the contract the shipper secured the assurance of due performance of a transportation service which otherwise might not have been promptly rendered, that ordinarily rental of engine and crew is not a common carrier service, and that such rental may be charged without filing a tariff providing therefor. Compare Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Maucher, 39 S. Ct. 108, \n248 U.S. 359\n. To so assure performance to a shipper was an undue preference. Hence the contract would be equally void for illegality on this ground. Davis v. Cornwell, 44 S. Ct. 410, \n264 U.S. 560\n.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & N.

Joseph L. Hooper, of Battle Creek, Mich., Myron H. Walker, of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Solomon W. Patek, of Ironwood, Mich., of counsel), for respondents. \n\n[271 U.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an interstate shipment made under the uniform order bill of lading the Chicago & Northwestern Railway received in 1921 at its yards in Ironwood, Mich., a box car containing apples consigned to the shipper's order 'notify F. M. Larson.' The car was placed on the 'team track,' which is one of the public delivery tracks used for unloading freight received in carload shipments and is not connected in any manner with a railway freight warehouse. The next morning at 8:20 o'clock Larson surrendered the bill of lading duly indorsed, paid the freight charges, gave to the railway his receipt for the apples, and commenced unloading the car. On the same day the Alvin R. Durham Company used out a writ of garnishment against the railway, which was served at 9:45 a. m. At that time about one- quarter of the apples had already been taken from the car by Larson. In spite of the service of the writ of garnishment, the railway did not prevent the further unloading. This was not completed until four days later. Meanwhile the car was locked every night by Larson. During this period of un- \n\n[271 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n loading, the car was shifted several times by the railway for its own convenience in the use of the team tracks.\n The trial court directed a verdict for the garnishee, on the ground that the railway did not have the custody, control, or possession of the shipment. The Supreme Court of Michigan reversed that judgment (Durham Co. v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 224 Mich. 477, 194 N. W. 1014), and held the carrier liable on the ground that, 'under the interpretation of section 5 of the uniform bill of lading, as appears pears in Michigan Cent. R. Co. v . (Mark) Owen (& Co.), \n256 \nU.S. 427\n, 41 S. Ct. 554 (65 L. Ed. 1032), ... the railway did have the custody, control, and possession of the interstate shipment.' Id., 229 Mich. 468, 201 N. W. 503. See, also, Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Durham Co., \n265 \nU.S. 580\n, 44 S. Ct. 455. This court granted a writ of certiorari. Id., \n268 \nU.S. 684\n, 45 S. Ct. 635. The sole question for decision is whether the railway is liable as garnishee.\n The facts in the two cases are similar, but the legal questions presented for decision are wholly different. In the Mark Owen Case it was sought to enforce under the federal law an alleged liability in contract of an interstate carrier to the consignee. Whether the railroad was liable depended upon the construction to be given the contract for an interstate shipment contained in the uniform bill of lading. Compare Southern Railway Co. v. Prescott, \n240 \nU.S. 632\n, 36 S. Ct. 469. The question was whether, in the absence of negligence, the railroad was liable to the consignee for grapes stolen from the car while on the team track after the unloading had begun, but before the expiration of 48 hours after giving notice of arrival. \n1\n The \n\n[271 U.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n railroad contended that, under section 5 of the bill of lading, there was no liability, because the surrender of the car to the consignee, followed by breaking the seals and commencement of unloading, constituted a delivery, and that, in any event, its responsibility for the unloaded part of the contents had become that of warehouseman. This court held that, since the theft occurred within the 48-hour period, there had not been, under the contract of the parties as expressed in section 5 of the bill of lading, such a delivery as would terminate the carrier's liability as insurer or reduce the liability to that of the warehouseman's exercise of reasonable care.\n In the case at bar it is sought to hold the railroad liable as garnishee to a stranger. It is not sought to enforce a liability arising under a federal law. As the order bill of lading had been surrendered, the Uniform Bill of Lading Act presented no obstacle to garnishment. Act of August 29, 1916, c. 415,  23, 39 Stat. 538, 543 (Comp. St.  8604l). But that act obviously confers no right to garnishment. Nor is there anything in the bill of lading which conceivably could be construed as either conferring or denying the right of garnishment. The plaintiff does not seek to enforce, as a derivative right, a claim of the consignee against the carrier under the bill of lading. It seeks to reach tangible property confessedly belonging to the principal defendant and to which the carrier confessedly makes no claim either of title or possession. Section 5 of the bill of lading clearly does not authorize a carrier, who had surrendered to the consignee control of the shipment upon surrender of the bill of lading, payment of charges and signing of the usual receipt, any right to recapture control of the unloaded part of the shipment in the event that garnishee proceedings are commenced within 48 hours after such surrender.\n The liabilities consequent upon the character of the custody and control exercised by carrier or consignee arise \n\n[271 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n from and are dependent upon the state statutes conferring the right of garnishment, and as such are unaffected by the provisions of the bill of lading. Thus the question whether, under the circumstances, the apples remaining in the car were subject to garnishment, is not one of uniform carrier liability, but, primarily, of procedure, and as such governed by varying views of local policy, legislation and practice. Thus, a garnishee may be under no liability, because the property could have been reached by direct levy. \n2\n He may be under no liability because of the nature of the claim sought to be enfored,3 or because of the character of the plaintiff, 4 of the principal defendant,5 of the garnishee,6 or of the property sought \n\n[271 U.S. 251, 258]\n\u00a0\n to be reached. \n7\n And, although no objection may exist upon any of these grounds, the garnishee may be held immune from liability, because the highest court of the state had declared that to allow garnishment, under the circumstances, would be against public policy, as where a carrier having possession, custody, and control of property is held not chargeable by garnishment because the goods were in process of transportation. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n Whether under the law of Michigan the railway was liable as garnishee, we have no occasion to inquire. There is nothing in the uniform bill of lading which would prevent the state court from holding that, although the freight car was in the carrier's possession, it was not liable as garnishee of the contents, because the apples were in the consignee's possession although not unloaded. A person breaking open and taking the contents of a chest in his custody has been held guilty of larceny. Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, \n198 \nU.S. 530, 537\n, 25 S. Ct. 766. The state court, however, reversed the judgment of the trial court because it assumed that the liability of the garnishee was fixed by the federal law, and that, under the rule declared in the Mark Owen Case, the railroad was liable. As this was error, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Ebert v. Poston, \n266 \nU.S. 548\n, 45 S. Ct. 188.

The order directed the steam railroads to remove the unjust discrimination which the Commission found was being practiced against an electric railroad, which also entered that city, by refusal to switch its interstate carload traffic and to make arrangements with it for reciprocal switching. Chicago, Lake Shore & South Bend Ry. Co. v. Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co., 88 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 525. The order was assailed on the grounds that the facts found did not in law sustain the finding of unjust discrimination, that the order deprives the plaintiffs of their property in violation of the due process clause, and that the electric railroad was not shown to be within the class of carriers entitled to relief against discrimination. The Commission and the electric railroad on whose behalf the order was entered intervened in the suit as defendants. The case was heard before three judges on application for a preliminary injunction which was denied without opinion. It is here on direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (Comp. St. s 998).\n The essential facts are these. The Chicago, Lake Shore & South Bend Railway Company, sometimes called the South Shore, is an electric passenger railroad which is engaged also in the general transportation of freight. Indiana Passenger Fares, etc., 69 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 180. Its line extends from South Bend, Ind., to Kensington, a station within the corporate limits of Chicago. At Michigan City it has physical connection with the Lake Erie & Western-a steam railroad which is a part of the New York Central system. The Lake Erie refused to establish through routes and joint rates to or from points on the South Shore and also refused to establish with it satisfactory interchange switching charges to industries at Michigan City. It had established such switching interchange with the three other steam railroads which enter that city-the Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville, commonly called the Monon, the Michigan Central, and the \n\n[270 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n Pere Marquette. To remove the alleged discrimination, the South Shore brought against the Lake Erie alone the proceeding reported in Chicago, Lake Shore & South Bend Ry. Co. v. Director General, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 647. By the order there entered the Lake Erie was directed to establish such through routes and joint rates with the South Shore, and was also directed to cease and desist from discriminating by refusing to perform reciprocal switching service with it while performing such switching with the three steam railroads named. The Lake Erie elected to remove the discrimination by entering into such reciprocal switching arrangements with the South Shore.\n None of the other three steam railroads had been a party to the proceeding against the Lake Erie. None of them had established through routes or joint rates with the South Shore to points on its line. Each of them refused to enter into an arrangement with it for reciprocal switching. But each of the four steam railroads had an arrangement for reciprocal switching with each of the others. Thus the South Shore still remained at a disadvantage in handling traffic at Michigan City. To remove the discrimination so arising a second petition was filed which resulted in the order here assailed. The position of the other steam railroads differed in one respect from the Lake Erie. It alone had a direct physical connection with the South Shore at Michigan City. Cars from the South Shore could not reach either the Michigan Central or the Monon without passing over tracks of the Lake Erie. They could not reach the Pere Marquette without passing over tracks of both the Lake Erie and the Monon.\n The South Shore was within the switching district at Michigan City and through routes and arrangements were already in effect by which traffic from the Monon, the Michigan Central, and the Pere Marquette would be delivered there to the South Shore as an industry, and on such traffic the switching charges would be absorbed. \n\n[270 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n Compare Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Reynolds-Davis Grocery Co., 45 S. Ct. 516, \n268 U.S. 366\n. The refusal of the steam railroads complained of relates to interchange traffic with the South Shore as a carrier for shippers on its line. The Commission found that this refusal constituted a discrimination, because each steam railroad rendered a like service for each of the others. The steam railroads contend that the circumstances and conditions in respect to the steam railroads were not similar, and that, hence, there could not in law be unjust discrimination. But the absence of direct physical connection between the South Shore and the three steam railroads other than the Lake Erie is the basis of the main attack upon the validity of the order.\n First. The steam railroads contend that, in effect, the order directs them to establish through routes and joint rates, or to allow a common use of terminals; that such extensions of service can legally be made only upon a finding that public necessity and convenience require them, Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, ss 402, 405, 418, amending Interstate Commerce Act, s 1, par. 21, section 3, par. 4, and section 15, pars. 3 and 4, 41 Stat. 456, 478, 479, 485, 486 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, ss 8563, 8565, 8583); and that, without making such a finding, the Commission has, under the guise of a discrimination order, compelled them to extend their service. It is argued that, as a matter of law, a carrier cannot be guilty of unjust discrimination unless it is able by its own act to remove the inequality; that where there is no direct physical connection with the railroad alleged to be discriminated against, and no joint service is being rendered by the three steam railroads with the South Shore, there cannot, in law, be unjust discrimination, because the existing inequality can be removed only by the consent of a third party, the intermediate carrier.\n The order does not require the steam railroads to extend any service to the South Shore. It leaves them free to \n\n[270 U.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n remove the discrimination by any appropriate action. American Express Co. v. Caldwell, 37 S. Ct. 656, \n244 U.S. 617\n, 624; United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., 44 S. Ct. 189, \n263 U.S. 516\n, 521. Direct Physical connection with the carrier subjected to prejudice is not an essential. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, 38 S. Ct. 49, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 144. Unjust discrimination may exist in law as well as in fact, although the injury is inflicted by a railroad which has no such direct connection. Wherever discrimination is, in fact, practiced, an order to remove it may issue, and the order may extend to every carrier who participates in inflicting the injury. United States v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 45 S. Ct. 43, \n266 U.S. 191\n, 197-199. There is nothing to the contrary in Central R. R. Co. of N. J. v. United States, 42 S. Ct. 80, \n257 U.S. 247\n. The relief sought there was denied solely because the Central, although it participated in establishing the through route and joint rate, did not participate in the service which alone was alleged to constitute discrimination. Here each of the steam railroads was an effective instrument of the discrimination complained of.\n Second. It is contended that the circumstances and conditions under which the interchange switching service was performed by the steam railroads for each other were essentially dissimilar from those under which such service would be performed for the South Shore. As establishing dissimilarity, the steam railroads point to the South Shore's absence of direct physical connection with any of the carriers except the Lake Erie; to the South Shore's relatively limited terminal facilities at Michigan City; to its relatively small number of freight cars; to the relative fewness of industries on its line; to the fact that the steam railroads exchange traffic at many points, while the South Shore will exchange traffic with them only at Michigan City; to the fact that the South Shore will originate relatively little business which can pass to the lines of \n\n[270 U.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n the steam railroads, while they originate much which may pass to the South Shore. Despite these facts, the Commission found that the circumstances and conditions were similar. The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Commission United States v. New River Co., 44 S. Ct. 610, \n265 U.S. 533\n, 542. The alleged lack of reciprocity and the other facts stated do not constitute, as a matter of law, differentiating circumstances which negative discrimination. Compare Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, 35 S. Ct. 370, \n236 U.S. 351\n, 364; United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., 44 S. Ct. 189, \n263 U.S. 515\n, 523.\n Third. It is contended that the order takes the steam railroads' property without due process of law. The argument is that, while in form the order leaves open to them alternatives, no one would seriously urge that they can, as a practical matter, comply with the Commission's order by ceasing to interchange traffic between themselves, as that would be contrary to obvious public interest and necessity; that, therefore in effect, the order requires them to permit the South Shore to take a part of the business which they are handling adequately; that business now enjoyed by them is their property, and that the order, therefore, amounts to taking their property in violation of the Constitution. Substantially the same objection was made and overruled in Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, 35 S. Ct. 370, \n236 U.S. 351\n, and Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, 35 S. Ct. 696, \n238 U.S. 1\n, 20. Compare Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, 41 S. Ct. 24, \n254 U.S. 57\n; United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., 44 S. Ct. 189, \n263 U.S. 515\n, 523; United States v. American Ry. Express Co., 44 S. Ct. 560, \n265 U.S. 425\n, 437-438\n\n\n Fourth. It is contended that the effect of the Commission's order is to require the steam railroads to establish the practice of reciprocal switching with the South Shore, and to establish rates and charges covering such switching; that power to issue such an order exists only where \n\n[270 U.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n the carrier is engaged in the general business of transporting freight in addition to' its passenger business, as required by section 418 of transportation Act 1920, February 28, 1920, c. 91, ss 418, 421, 41 Stat. 456, 484, 487, 488 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 8583); and that the Commission was without jurisdiction to enter the order because there is not in the record satisfactory evidence that the South Shore was engaged in the general transportation of freight. See The Chicago Junction Case, 44 S. Ct. 317, \n264 U.S. 258\n. Since the decision of this case below, it has been held by this Court that the Commission has power to prevent unjust discrimination practiced by an electric railroad against a steam railroad engaged in interstate commerce, even if the electric line is neither operated as part of a steam railway system nor engaged in the general transportation of freight in addition to its passenger and express business. United States v. Village of Hubbard, 45 S. Ct. 160, \n266 U.S. 474\n. It is insisted, however, that the limitation contained in section 418 applies, because in this case it is the electric line which is seeking relief. The contention is groundless. Moreover, the Commission found that the South Shore is also engaged in the general transportation of freight. Its finding is necessarily conclusive as the evidence taken before the Commission was not introduced below. Louisiana & Pine Bluff Ry. Co. v. United States, 42 S.

In both cases, the full faith and credit clause of the federal Constitution was invoked. At the trial in the Minnesota district court, the judgment in the one case and the decision in the other, together with a copy of the Iowa Workmen's Compensation Law, all properly authenticated, were offered in evidence in support of the plea, but, upon objection, excluded. Verdicts against the railway company were rendered and judgments entered accordingly. Appeals to the state supreme court followed. The action of the Minnesota district court in refusing to give effect to the Iowa judgment and decision was assigned as error and duly challenged as denying them the full faith and credit enjoined by the federal Constitution; but the Minnesota Supreme Court, upon full consideration, sustained the trial court in that respect and affirmed both judgments. 204 N.

Hope and Elder were residents of Iowa and employees of the railway company, and it is not in dispute that they and the company had elected to be bound by its provisions. The statute will be found in Code of Iowa 1924, s 1361 et seq. It adopts a schedule of compensation, creates the office of industrial commissioner, and authorizes him to appoint a deputy, make rules and regulations not inconsistent with the act, summon witnesses, administer oaths, etc., and contains other provisions, not necessary to be stated, for its administration and enforcement. If the parties fail to reach an agreement in regard to the compensation, the commissioner, at the request of either party, is directed to form a committee of arbitration to consist of three persons, one of whom shall be the commissioner, the others to be named \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 614]\n\u00a0\n by the parties, respectively. The arbitrators are directed to hear the case and decide the matter. Their decision, together with a statement of the evidence, findings of fact, rulings of law, and other pertinent matters, must then be filed with the commissioner. At the end of five days after such filing, unless a review is sought in the meantime, the decision becomes enforceable. Upon the application of any party in interest, the commissioner may review the decision; and, if any party be aggrieved by reason of his order or decree thereon, such party may appeal to the state district court having jurisdiction, in the manner and upon the grounds set forth in the act. The judgment of that court is given the same effect as though rendered in a suit duly heard and determined therein; and an appeal from it lies to the Supreme Court of the state. \n No. 683.\n\n In the Hope Case, the action was brought in the Minnesota district court on February 21, 1923, under the federal Employers' Liability Law ( Comp. St. ss 8657-8665), for the sole benefit of the surviving widow. Thereafter, on March 2, 1923, the railway company instituted a proceeding before the Iowa industrial commissioner under the Iowa Workmen's Compensation Act. To this proceeding the decedent's widow was made a party, as the sole beneficiary under the act. The railway company asked for an arbitration. The widow answered, asserting that the Compensation Act did not apply because the company and the deceased were both engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident. Arbitrators were appointed, though the widow did not join in their appointment. The arbitrators found that deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce and that the case was governed by the Compensation Act, and awarded compensation to the widow. Thereupon, the widow filed an application in review with the commissioner That officer reviewed the facts, specifically found \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 615]\n\u00a0\n that the deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce, and approved the award. The widow then appealed to the district court of Lucas county, Iowa, and that court, on June 2, 1923, specifically held that the deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce and entered final judgment affirming the award. Thereafter, on March 4, 1924, the present action was heard in the Minnesota district court and verdict and judgment rendered for respondent.\n The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the plea of res judicata was bad for two reasons: (1) That 'the substantive right given the employee or his representative by Comgress under express constitutional grant, with the courts to which he may go for its enforcement pointed out to him, is a superior substantive right; and that when he or his representative has chosen the forum to which to submit his cause, he cannot, against his objection and upon the initiative of his employer, be required to submit it in a summary proceeding commenced later under a Compensation Act'; and ( 2) that there was a lack of identity of parties, since under the Iowa statute the right of recovery is in the beneficiary while under the federal act the right is in the personal representative.\n\n 1. \nIt is evident from the opinion, that the court formulated the first reason with some hesitation. It is elementary, of course, that, in any judicial proceeding, the arrangement of the parties on the record, so long as they are adverse, or the fact that the party against whom the estoppel is pleaded was an objecting party, is of no consequence. A judgment is as binding upon an unwilling defendant as it is upon a willing plaintiff. Nor is it material that the action or proceeding, in which the judgment, set up as an estoppel, is rendered, was brought after the commencement of the action or proceeding in which it is pleaded. Where both are in personam, the second action or proceeding 'does not tend to impair or defeat the jurisdiction of the court in which a prior action for \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 616]\n\u00a0\n the same cause is pending. Each court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time, without reference to the proceedings in the other court. Whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other, the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principles of res judicata by the court in which the action is still pending in the orderly exercise of its jurisdiction, as it would determine any other question of fact or law arising in the progress of the case. The rule, therefore, has become generally established that where the action first brought is in personam and seeks only a personal judgment, another action for the same cause in another jurisdiction is not precluded.' Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 43 S. Ct. 79, 81, \n260 \nU.S. 226, 230\n, 24 S. A. L. R. 1077\n\n\n It is urged in behalf of respondent that the federal act is supreme and supersedes all state laws in respect of employers' liability in interstate commerce. That is quite true; but it does not advance the solution of the point in dispute, since it is equally true that, in respect of such liability arising in intrastate commerce, the state law is supreme. Judicial power to determine the question in a case brought under a state statute is in no way inferior or subordinate to the same power in a case brought under the federal act.\n The Iowa proceeding was brought and determined upon the theory that Hope was engaged in intrastate commerce; the Minnesota action was brought and determined upon the opposite theory that he was engaged in interstate commerce. The point at issue was the same. That the Iowa court had jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding and decide the question under the state statute, cannot be doubted. Under the federal act, the Minnesota court had equal authority; but the Iowa judgment was first rendered. And, upon familiar principles, irrespective of which action or proceeding was first brought, it is the first final judgment rendered in one \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 617]\n\u00a0\n of the courts which becomes conclusive in the other as res judicata. Boatmen's Bank v. Fritzlen, 135 F. 650, 667, 68 C. C. A. 288; Merritt v. American Steel Barge Co., 79 F. 228, 234, 24 C. C. A. 530; Williams v. Southern Pac. Co., 202 P. 356, 54 Cal. App. 571, 575. And see Insurance Co. v. Harris, \n97 U.S. 331\n, 336, where the rule as stated was recognized.\n The Iowa court, under the Compensation Law, in the due exercise of its jurisdiction, having adjudicated the character of the commerce in which the deceased was engaged, that matter, whether rightly decided or not, must be taken as conclusively established, so long as the judgment remains unmodified. United States v. Moser, 45 S. Ct. 66, \n266 U.S. 236\n, 241, and cases cited. And, putting aside for the moment the question in respect of identity of parties, the judgment upon the point was none the less conclusive as res judicata because it was rendered under the state Compensation Law, while the action in which it was pleaded arose under the federal Liability Law. Dennison v. Payne (C. C. A.) 293 F. 333, 341, 342; Williams v. Southern Pac. Co., supra, pages 574, 575 (202 P. 356).\n\n 2. \nIn the Iowa proceeding, the widow of the deceased was a party in her own right and clearly was bound by the judgment. The action in Minnesota, however, was brought by the administrator, and the state Supreme Court on the authority of Dennison v. Payne, supra, pages 342, 343, held that there was a want of identity of parties. The decision in the Dennison Case rests entirely on Troxell v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R., 33 S. Ct. 274, \n227 U.S. 434\n. The effect of the last-named case we pass for later consideration.\n Hope's death as the result of the negligence of the railroad company gave rise to a single cause of action, to be enforced directly by the widow, under the state law, or in the name of the personal representative, for the sole benefit of the widow, under the federal law, depending upon the character of the commerce in which the deceased and the company were engaged at the time of the acci- \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 618]\n\u00a0\n dent. In either case, the controlling question is precisely the same, namely, Was the deceased engaged in intrastate or interstate commerce? and the right to be enforced is precisely the same, namely, the right of the widow, as sole beneficiary, to be compensated in damages for her loss. The fact that the party impleaded, under the state law, was the widow, and, under the federal law, was the personal representative, does not settle the question of identity of parties. That must be determined as a matter of substance and not of mere form. The essential consideration is that it is the right of the widow, and of no one else, which was presented and adjudicated in both courts. If a judgment in the Minnesota action in favor of the administrator had been first rendered, it does not admit of doubt that it would have been conclusive against the right of the widow to recover under the Iowa compensation law. And it follows, as a necessary corollary, that the Iowa judgment, being first, is equally conclusive against the administrator in the Minnesota action; for if, in legal contemplation, there is identity of parties in the one situation, there must be like identity in the other.\n The first proposition finds support in Heckman v. United States, 32 S. Ct. 424, \n224 U.S. 413\n, 445-446 (56 L. Ed. 820) where this court held that the United States had capacity to maintain a suit to set aside conveyances made by Indian allottees of allotted lands and that the allottees need not be joined. The defendant in that case insisted that, unless the allottees who had executed the conveyances were brought in as parties, he was in danger of being subjected to a second suit by the allottees. Answering that contention, this court said:\n'But if the United States, representing the owners of restricted lands, is entitled to bring a suit of this character, it must follow that the decree will bind not only the United States, but the Indians whom it represents in the litigation. This consequence is involved in the rep- \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 619]\n\u00a0\n resentation Kerrison v. Stewart, \n93 U.S. 155\n, 160, (23 L. Ed. 843); Shaw v. Railroad Co., \n100 U.S. 605\n, 611 (25 L. Ed. 757); Beals v. Ill., etc., R. R. Co. (10 S. Ct. 314) \n133 U.S. 290\n, 295 (33 L. Ed. 608). And it could not, consistently with any principle, be tolerated that, after the United States on behalf of its wards had invoked the jurisdiction of its courts to cancel conveyances in violation of the restrictions prescribed by Congress, these wards should themselves be permitted to relitigate the question.'\n\n And, conversely, in United States v. Des Moines Valley R. Co., 84 F. 40, 28 C. C. A. 267, where a suit in the name of the government was brought to enforce the right of a private party, it was held that a prior adverse adjudication by a state court in a suit against him personally, determining the same issues, was available as an estoppel against the government. The ground of the decision was thus stated (pages 44, 45 (28 C. C. A. 272)):\n'Inasmuch, then, as the government sues for the sole benefit of Fairchild, and for the professed purpose of reinvesting him with a title which he has lost, we are of opinion that, whether the present action be regarded as brought under the Act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. 556, c. 376 (Comp. St. s 4895 et seq.)), or as brought in pursuance of its general right to sue, the government should be held estopped by the previous adjudications against the real party in interest in the state court. The subject-matter and the issue to be tried being the same in this proceeding as in the former actions, the losing party on the former trials ought not to be permitted to renew the controversy in the name of a merely nominal plaintiff, and thereby avoid the effect of the former adjudications. Southern Minnesota Railway Extension Co. v. St. Paul & S. C. R. Co., 12 U. S. App. 320, 325, 55 F. 690, 5 C. C. A. 249. This doctrine was applied by this court in the case of Union Pac. Ry. Co. v. U. S., 32 U. S. App. 311, 319, 67 F. 975, 15 C. C. A. 123, which was a suit brought by the United States under the Act of March 3, 1887, wherein we \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 620]\n\u00a0\n held that the United States was bound by an estoppel which might have been invoked against the real party in interest if the suit had been brought in his name, because it appeared that the United States had no substantial interest in the controversy, and was merely a nominal plaintiff.'\n\n Since the statutory authority of the administrator is to sue, not in his own right or for his own benefit, or that of the estate, but in the right and for the sole benefit of the widow, the same principles are applicable, in accordance with the general rule that 'whenever an action may properly be maintained or defended by a trustee in his representative capacity without joining the beneficiary, the latter is necessarily bound by the judgment.' 1 Freeman on Judgments (5th Ed.) s 500. Identity of parties is not a mere matter of form, but of substance. Parties nominally the same may be, in legal effect, different (Bigelow on Estoppel (6th Ed.) 145); and parties nominally different may be, in legal effect, the same ( Calhoun's Lessee v. Dunning, 4 Dall. (Pa.) 120, 121; Follansbee v. Walker, 74 Pa. 306, 309; In re Estate of Parks, 147 N. W. 850, 166 Iowa, 403.\n In the Follansbee Case, a judgment against Joshua Follansbee alone was held available as an estoppel in another action brought by Walker & Follansbee for the use of Joshua. Justice Sharswood, speaking for the court, said:\n'The parties in that suit and in the action tried below were substantially the same. In the former Joshua Follansbee was the legal, in the latter he is the equitable, plaintiff. The subject-matter of the two suits appeared by the record to be identical. The presumption would be upon the issues, that the merits had been passed upon in the former proceeding. Such being the case, if no technical objection appeared to have been raised upon the record to the right of Joshua Follansbee to maintain the action as legal plaintiff, the judgment in that action would be a bar to a subsequent action by him as equitable plain- \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 621]\n\u00a0\n tiff. If it appeared that only the equitable, not the legal right, was in Joshua Follansbee, it would be presumed that the defendant had waived that purely technical objection. It would be very unreasonable and contrary to the settled rules upon the subject, to permit the plaintiff having once been defeated on the merits, to try the same question over again in a different form.'\n\n In the Parks Case, a judgment against the sole beneficiary of an estate in her individual capacity was held conclusive in a subsequent action by the same plaintiff against the same defendant as administratrix, on the ground that, while theoretically the former suit was not against the same defendant as administratrix, nevertheless she was the sole beneficiary of the estate, and represented only herself in each case.\n In Corcoran v. Chesapeake, etc., Canal Co., \n94 U.S. 741\n, 745, this court, holding that a judgment against a trustee for bondholders was conclusive in a suit involving the same subject-matter, brought by him in his individual character, said:\n'It would be a new and very dangerous doctrine in the equity practice to hold that the cestui que trust is not bound by the decree against his trustee in the very matter of the trust for which he was appointed.'\n\n See, also, Kerrison, Assignee, v. Stewart et al., \n93 U.S. 155\n, 160; Spokane & Inland R. R. v. Whitley, 35 S. Ct. 655, \n237 U.S. 487\n, 496, L. R. A. 1915F, 736; Estate of Bell, 95 P. 372, 153 Cal. 331, 344; Chandler v. Lumber, Co., 173 S. W. 449, 131 Tenn. 47, 51.\n Upon facts almost identical with those now under review, it was held in Williams v. Southern Pac. Co., supra, pages 571, 576 (202 P. 356), that there was a substantial identity of parties, and that a judgment for the widow under the California Compensation Act was available as an estoppel in a prior action brought by her as administratrix under the federal act.\n It remains only to consider the bearing of the Troxell Case, supra, upon this point. Mrs. Troxell, the widow of \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 622]\n\u00a0\n a deceased employee, sued the railroad company under a state statute, for the benefit of herself and minor children, to recover for the death of her husband resulting from a negligent failure to provide safe instrumentalities. There was a judgment against her. She then brought suit under the federal Employers' Liability Act, as administratrix, averring the negligence of a fellow servant, a ground of recovery which was not available to her in the action under the state statute. It was held, following the general rule, that, the cause of action in the two cases being different and the issue determined in the first not being involved in the second, there was no estoppel. This was decisive of the case, but the court proceeded to say that, furthermore, there was not an identity of parties in the two actions. Two former decisions of this court are cited, Brown v. Flectcher's Estate, 28 S. Ct. 702, \n210 U.S. 82\n and Ingersoll v. Coram, 29 S. Ct. 92, \n211 U.S. 335\n. Both cases, following the well-established rule, simply decide that there is no privity between administrators appointed in different states, since the authority of an executor or administrator appointed in one state does not extend to the property or administration in another state.\n Whether, in the light of the foregoing views, we now should hold that where, as in the Troxell Case, the rights of additional beneficiaries, not actual parties to the first judgment, are involved, the requirement of identity of parties is unsatisfied, is a question we do not feel called upon here to re-examine, since we are clear that such requirement is fully met in the situation now under consideration, where the sole beneficiary was an actual party to the proceeding under the state law, and present by her statutory representative in the action under the federal law, and no other rights were involved.\n No. 684.\n In the Elder Case, as in the case just considered, the railway company began a proceeding before the indus- \n\n[270 U.S. 611, 623]\n\u00a0\n trial commissioner. Elder answered, averring that he was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the injury. The parties stipulated that the commissioner or his deputy should take the place of the arbitration committee; and the deputy commissioner, pursuant to the stipulation, heard the matter and filed his decision. Thereupon Elder applied for a review by the commissioner, under the statute, but no action had been taken upon that application by the commissioner at the time the judgment was rendered in the Minnesota court. Under the Iowa statute, therefore, the decision had not ripened into an enforceable award, and we are not called upon to determine what, in that event, would have been its effect as an estoppel. The proceeding being still in fieri when the Minnesota case was tried and determined, the doctrine of res judicata is not applicable. There must be a final judgment. Bigelow on Estoppel (6th Ed.) p. 64; Webb v. Buckelew et al., 82 N. Y. 555, 559, 560.\n It follows that the judgment in the Hope Case must be reversed, and that in the Elder Case affirmed.\n No. 683: Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n No. 684: Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO.

Root, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Messrs. T. D.

William Coogan came to his death at Farmington, Minn., July 14, 1923, while employed as a brakeman on one of its interstate trains. Respondent brought this action in the district court of Dakota county in that state under the federal Employers' Liability Act, approved April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. 65, c. 149 ( Comp. St.  8657-8665)), to recover damages for the benefit of the widow and children of the deceased. At the close of all the evidence, petitioner moved the court to direct a verdict in its favor on the ground, among others, that respondent had failed to prove any actionable negligence on the part of petitioner, and that any verdict for respondent would be based upon speculation and conjecture. The motion was denied, and there was a verdict for respondent. A motion for judgment in favor of petitioner notwithstanding the verdict was overruled. Judgment for respondent was given by the trial court, and, on appeal, it was affirmed in the highest court of the state. 160 Minn. 411, 200 N. W. 477. The case is here on writ of certiorari. Section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n Petitioner contends that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding that any negligence on its part caused or contributed to cause the death.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 472, 474]\n\u00a0\n By the federal Employes' Liability Act, Congress took possession of the field of employers' liability to employees in interstate transportation by rail, and all state laws upon that subject were superseded. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475. The rights and obligations of the petitioner depend upon that act and applicable principles of common law as interpreted by the federal courts. The employer is liable for injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence specified in the act and proof of such negligence is essential to recovery. The kind or amount of evidence required to establish it is not subject to the control of the several states. This court will examine the record, and if it is found that, as a matter of law, the evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding that the carrier's negligence was a cause of the death, judgment against the carrier will be reversed. St. L., Iron M. & S. Ry. v. McWhirter, \n229 \nU.S. 265, 277\n, 33 S. Ct. 858; New Orleans & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Harris, \n247 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 38 S. Ct. 535; New Orleans & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Scarlet, \n249 \nU.S. 528\n, 39 S. Ct. 369.\n Petitioner's train 92 was made up at the Farmington yard by a switch crew shortly after 7 o'clock in the morning. Deceased was the rear brakeman of the road crew which was to take the train to Austin. He was killed before the train was ready to start. There was no eyewitness, and the case depends on circumstantial evidence. The tracks in the yard run east and west. The most northerly is the main line track, and, commencing with that one, the others are numbered consecutively 1, 2, 3, etc. Cars were taken from other tracks and put upon track 1 to make up the train. The caboose was kicked-that is detached from the engine in motion and sent by momentum-east to a place where it was stopped by deceased, who road and controlled it by hand brake. Two cars were in like manner put upon that track. They were controlled by a brakeman of the switch crew at the hand brake on the east \n\n[271 U.S. 472, 475]\n\u00a0\n car, which coupled automatically to the caboose. Deceased was then standing on the ground beside the caboose. That was the last time he was seen before the accident. Similarly nine or ten more cars were sent east on track 1, and under control of the same brakeman were coupled to the others. And then three or four cars-making up all that were to go in the train-were moved east on that track attached to the engine until they came into contact with the cars already there. Then the engine was stopped to discover whether the coupling made. It was found that it had, and, in order to clear the switch, the engine moved all the cars east about two car lengths-66 to 80 feet. Then the switch engine was detached. Immediately the road engine came and was coupled to the cars. The air hose was coupled between the engine and the first car. But it was found that the air line was open at some other place. The brakeman of the switch crew walked east along the south side of the train and coupled the hose at the east end of the last cut that was set in. After that, and while going toward the rear he found the body of deceased. It was near the west end of the second car from the caboose, and was lying parallel with the track, outside the south rail and on or at the ends of the ties. There were indications on the ground sufficient to show that he had been between the rails of the track, that he had been run over by the east truck of the car next to the caboose, that his left leg and left arm had been crushed between wheel and rail, and that his body had been dragged about 15 feet. There was evidence to support respondent's contention that it was the duty of deceased to couple the air hose, and that prior to the accident all couplings had been made, except that made by the brakeman of the switch crew and the one at the caboose.\n The breach of duty relied on is this: About 12 inches south of the south rail of the track, and fastened to the ties by clamps and spikes, there was an air pipe line ex- \n\n[271 U.S. 472, 476]\n\u00a0\n tending about 800 feet. It was installed three or four years before the accident. At the time of the accident, a stretch of the pipe line about 15 feet in length had been loosened and bent 3 or 4 inches toward the rail and upward leaving a space of from 3 1\/2 to 4 inches between it and the ties. It had been in that condition for some months. The evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding that there was a breach of duty in this respect. But the precise question for decision is whether the condition of the pipe caused or contributed to cause the death of deceased. The east end of the part so loosened and bent was about 15 feet west of the place where the body of deceased was found. Respondent argues that a brakeman, going in from the south side to couple the hose between the caboose and rear car, naturally would step inside the south rail with his right foot, leaving his left foot between the rail and the air pipe line. As to that the evidence is in conflict, but it will be taken to be sufficient to sustain the contention. The shoes worn by deceased at the time of the accident were received in evidence. The outside of the counter of the left shoe was scratched, and showed a marked rounding depression parallel with the sole and just above the heel. This condition was first noticed some days after the accident. In the meantime the shoes had been left in a garage and no attention was given to them. The depression in the counter was not so clear at the trial as when first noticed. The foregoing indicates the substance of all the evidence bearing on the cause of death.\n The case was tried, and respondent supports the judgment, on the theory that, when the switch engine stopped after the last coupling, deceased went between the caboose and car to couple the air hose; that he stepped between the rails with his right foot, leaving his left foot outside the south rail and between it and the pipe line; that, stooping to reach the air hose his left foot slipped back \n\n[271 U.S. 472, 477]\n\u00a0\n ward under the bent pipe; that, before he had time to make the coupling, the cars were started backward in the movement to clear the switch; that, when he attempted to straighten up, his left foot was caught under the pipe, and he was forced backward, run over, and killed. It follows that, unless the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding that the death resulted from the catching of deceased's left foot under the bent part of the pipe line the judgment cannot be sustained. As there is no direct evidence, it is necessary to determine whether the circumstances are sufficient to warrant a finding of that fact. Whenever circumstantial evidence is relied on to prove a fact, the circumstances must be proved and not themselves presumed United States v. Ross, \n92 U.S. 281\n, 284; Manning v. Insurance Co., \n100 U.S. 693\n, 698. Assuming it was the duty of deceased to couple the air hose, it was necessary for him to go between the cars to do so. He was standing by the caboose when the first cut came in. The air hose coupling might have been made then or at any time after that. It was not made, and it is left to be inferred that he postponed effort in that direction until after all the switching had been done and until the engine had hold of the string of cars. And then it must be inferred that he went between the cars in the manner claimed-his right foot between the rails, leaving his left foot outside, where, it is argued, it was caught under the bent pipe.\n The 'rounding depression' on the counter of the shoe is not sufficient to bridge the hiatus in the evidence. It is not shown when or how that depression was made. The condition of the shoe before the accident is not disclosed. A number of days elapsed before it was noticed, and it is not shown that in the meantime care was taken to keep it in the same condition or that the depression was not made after the accident. Even if the appearance of the shoe and other circumstances are sufficient to \n\n[271 U.S. 472, 478]\n\u00a0\n justify an inference that the depression might have been made by the bent pipe, it cannot be said that they constitute any reasonable support for a finding that it was so made. And, assuming that the depression on the shoe counter was made by contact with the bent pipe, there is nothing to indicate whether it was made at the time deceased was knocked down, or later while he was being dragged. But there is nothing to show that the pipe had any connection with the accident. The fact that deceased was run over and killed at the time and place disclosed has no tendency to show that his foot was caught. One between cars coupling the air hose is very liable to be run over, if the train is unexpectedly moved. A finding that his foot was not caught under the pipe is quite as consistent with the evidence as a finding that it was.\n It is the duty of the trial judge to direct a verdict for one of the parties when the testimony and all the inferences which the jury reasonably may draw therefrom would be insufficient to support a different finding. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521, 524\n, 45 S. Ct. 169. When the evidence and the conclusions which a jury might fairly draw from the evidence are taken most strongly against the petitioner the contention of respondent that the bent pipe caused or contributed to cause the death is without any substantial support. The record leaves the matter in the realm of speculation and conjecture. That is not enough. Pawling v. United States, 4 Cranch, 219, 221; Patton v.

She owned certain duly allotted lands in Oklahoma, patented by the Secretary of the Interior September 26, 1896, and declared to be 'inalienable for a period of 25 years' thereafter-all as provided by the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 188, s 1, 28 Stat. 876, 907. Following the state statute of descent, the Secretary declared that the only heirs were her husband and brother-John Beaver and Benjamin Quapaw-full-blood Quapaws. Act June 25, 1910, c. 431, s 1, 36 Stat. 855 (Comp. St. s 4226); Henrietta First Moon v. Starling White Tail, 46 S. Ct. 246, \n270 U.S. 243\n (March 1, 1926). Restrictions upon the land were continued \n\n[270 U.S. 555, 559]\n\u00a0\n for another 25 years by the Act of March 3, 1921, c. 119, s 26, 41 Stat. 1225, 1248\n\n\n Apparently appellant supposed that the lands passed to the heirs by virtue of the laws of the state and were subject to the inheritance taxes which she laid. He accordingly demanded their payment of appellees and threatened enforcement by summary process and sale of the lands. The court below held that the state had no right to demand the taxes and restrained appellant from attempting to collect them.\n The duty of the Secretary of the Interior to determine the heirs according to the state law of descent is not questioned. Congress provided that the lands should descend and directed how the heirs should be ascertained. It adopted the provisions of the Oklahoma statute as an expression of its own will; the laws of Missouri or Kansas, or any other state, might have been accepted. The lands really passed under a law of the United States, and not by Oklahoma's permission.\n It must be accepted as established that during the trust or restrictive period Congress has power to control lands within a state which have been duly allotted to Indians by the United States and thereafter conveyed through trust or restrictive patents. This is essential to the proper discharge of their duty to a dependent people, and the means or instrumentalities utilized therein cannot be subjected to taxation by the state without assent of the federal government.

Daniels, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1215), allowed February 18, 1925, in two cases between the same parties from identical decrees of the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. By agreement they are to be treated in every respect as one. The certificate of the District Court is that the petition as amended 'does not show the existence of the requisite diversity of citizenship, nor the existence of a federal question, and that this court, not having found the said petition to be ancillary to any prior suit, but having found the said petition to be original, did thereupon dismiss the same upon the sole ground of want of jurisdiction.' The question of jurisdiction is whether a petition by the purchasing company at a railway foreclosure sale, in seeking to \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 111]\n\u00a0\n reform, because of mistake, its contract of purchase in imposing upon it liability for rentals under a terminal facilities contract, is a suit ancillary to the original foreclosure suit, so that jurisdiction exists in the federal District Court to hear it, without regard to the citizenship of the necessary parties to the petition.\n The two original foreclosure suits were brought, one by the Equitable Trust Company of New York and Elias J. Jacoby as trustees, against the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, and the other by the Central Trust Company of New York and Mason, trustees, against the same railway company. There was the necessary diversity of citizenship in each case, and the appellant in this present suit, the Cincinnati Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, is a newly organized company, the assignee of the purchaser at the foreclosure sales of the whole railroad property covered by all the mortgages foreclosed. It became a party to each cause as such assignee, as permitted in the decree of foreclosure in each case, and it will be hereafter called the purchasing company.\n The Indiana, Decatur & Western Railway Company owned the part of the railway from Indianapolis to Springfield, Ill. The Cincinnati, Hamilton & Indianapolis Railway Company owned the part from Indianapolis to the East. In 1902 they were merged into a corporation called the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, which gave a first refunding mortgage upon the two properties. It was expected that the bonds secured by this mortgage would be used in refunding two underlying mortgages on the eastern part, and a single underlying mortgage on the western part. The refunding was not completed, and the two foreclosure suits, already referred to, were filed at the same time in the same court, so that by an identical decree in each case the purchaser was enabled to acquire title to the con- \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 112]\n\u00a0\n solidated railway free from the liens of the four mortgages. The decree of foreclosure in each case contained a provision giving the purchaser under the foreclosure sale, and his successors or assigns, the right for a period of 30 days after the delivery of the master's deed to elect 'whether or not to assume or adopt any lease or contract made by the defendant consolidated company, or its predecessors in title, and such purchaser, his successors or assigns, shall be held not to have adopted or assumed any such lease or contract in respect of which he or they shall have filed a written election not to assume or adopt the same with the clerk of this court within the said period of 30 days.'\n Within the 30 days the purchasing company filed in the two foreclosure cases what it called an election 'not to assume or adopt the contract dated September 20, 1883, and the amendment of August 20, 1906, under which the tracks of the Union Railway Company are occupied in Indianapolis in so far as such rights are conferred by the signature of the Indianapolis, Decatur & Springfield Railway Company to said contract. This assignee hereby expressly accepts such contract as made with the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Indianapolis Railroad Company, and desires to accept the benefits of the contract with said company, and the right to occupy the tracks of the Union Railway Company and the Indianapolis Belt Railway Company therein conferred.'\n The Indianapolis Union Railway Company is a company engaged in operating a union railway depot and union railway tracks for the use of several railroads entering that city; its properties having been owned by five so-called proprietary companies and conveyed by them to it. It had acquired a perpetual lease of a belt line. September 20, 1883, an agreement was made between the Union Railway Company and five proprietary companies, by which each of the companies in the use of the terminals \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 113]\n\u00a0\n became liable for a fixed rental which was to be paid by each company, whether the terminal was used or not. Then there were admitted seven non- proprietary companies to the joint use of the Belt Railway and Union Railway Company property under the same agreement as to a fixed rental, in addition to which there was to be a payment in proportion to the use on the basis of wheelage. At this time the Indianapolis, Decatur & Springfield Railway Company owned the part of the railroad here in question west of Indianapolis, and it bound itself for one-thirteenth of the rental, and the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Indianapolis Railroad Company, owning the other part of the railroad here in question east of Indianapolis, became bound for another one-thirteenth of the rental. In 1902 the two companies were united under the name of the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railroad Company, and from that time until the foreclosure, in 1915, the united company paid two-thirteenths of the rentals. When, however, the decrees were made in the foreclosure of the two parts of the railway, the purchasing company, the appellant here, sought to reduce its rental from two-thirteenths to one-thirteenth, by electing to take the contract for rental of its predecessor in title of the eastern part of the united railway, and to refuse to elect to take the contract of rental of its predecessor in title for the western part of the railway, and, having filed such an election, it declined to pay more than one-thirteenth of the rental.\n There then intervened in the original foreclosure suits the Indianapolis Union Railway Company and the then proprietary parties to the terminal agreement by petitions asking that the purchasing company show cause why it sould not be ordered to make payment to the Indianapolis Union Company of the full amount that would have been payable to that company by the Cincin- \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 114]\n\u00a0\n nati, Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, the defendant in the foreclosure in both suits. Jurisdiction was taken of this petition, and the District Court held that the so-called election was unauthorized and improper, and that the purchasing company, for failure to elect to reject the contracts entirely, was responsible for two-thirteenths of the total rentals. This controversy was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court. Cincinnati, I. & W. R. Co. v. Indianapolis Union Railroad Co., 279 F. 356.\n The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals was made in 1922. In 1924, the present intervening petition was filed by appellant as purchaser against the Indianapolis Union Railway Company and the proprietary companies, which had been parties to the preceding controversy. In this the petitioner, the present appellant, sought to have the court relieve it from the effect of its so-called ineffective election by which it made itself responsible according to the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for two-thirteenths, on the ground of its mistake in not electing to reject the whole contract for use of the terminals. On the hearing of the petition to which the Indianapolis Union Railway Company and the other defendants filed answers, the District Court held that the delay of two years between the coming down of the decree from the Circuit Court of Appeals in 1922 until 1924, when the petition was filed, was a delay constituting acquiescence which would prevent the consideration of the petition. The petitioner then filed an amendment to its petition, in which it set out reasons thought by it to justify the delay, including a statement that attempts had been made to secure relief by a personal negotiation with the interested parties to whom it had indicated from the first that it did not intend to acquiesce in an obligation to pay the rentals. The District Court, conceiving that by reason of the delay of two years such relief as the petitioners \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 115]\n\u00a0\n sought must be obtained by an independent suit, and not by an ancillary proceeding, held that there being no diversity of citizenship or federal question to justify jurisdiction, the petition must be dismissed.\n The sufficiency of the petition in equity is not for us to consider. We have here only the question of jurisdiction. On that issue, we think the District Court was in error. The present proceeding deals with the effect of the decree upon which the petitioner became the owner of the property. The previous litigation between the parties to this petition as to the effect of the attempted election, in which the petitioner was defeated, involved a construction of the decree of sale and the purchaser's action under it in the foreclosure proceedings. That decree provided that 'all questions not hereby disposed of are reserved for future adjudication. Any party to this cause may at any time apply to this court for further relief at the foot of this decree.' It also provided 'that the purchaser had the right to enter appearance in this court and to become a party to this cause,' and it made itself a party under that order. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in its opinion in the case already cited, said:\n'Notwithstanding the property had passed from the possession of the court, appellant (that is, petitioner) as the purchaser would have an undoubted right to apply to the court for relief respecting the controversy over its right of election under the sale.'\n\n At the instance of the defendants here, the purchaser was held by its so-called election to be bound to the two contracts, and, having been thus defeated, it seeks the equitable intervention of the court, on the ground of mistake, to secure relief from this adjudicated effect of its unsuccessful attempt at election. Assuming that it has a right to seek such a remedy (and we must do so in this hearing), we do not see why it may not obtain that relief in the same forum by ancillary proceeding in the original suit in foreclosure in which it was held to have bound \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 116]\n\u00a0\n itself by its purchase and ineffective election. It may be that equity will not give it relief from mistake under the circumstances. It may be that it has acquiesced, and may be denied relief on that account. It may be that it has been guilty of laches. But these are questions on the merits. We cannot see that they affect the jurisdiction of the court to consider the issue thus raised.\n The present proceeding is only another phase of the same litigation, carried on as ancillary to the foreclosure suit, in which the purchasing company was found to be bound by its purchase to pay two-thirteenths of the rentals to the Indianapolis Union Railway. The purchaser seeks to recur to the circumstances under which it attempted to accept liability to pay one-thirteenth of the rental and to reject the other one-thirteenth. It says that, as the Circuit Court of Appeals has held that its attempted election was invalid and ineffective for the purpose, it should have equitable relief from the oppressive obligation to pay two-thirteenths on the ground of its mistake and be permitted to make an election which will relieve it from the contract to pay any rental at all, as it might have done when it became the purchaser. Such a proceeding is certainly anocillary to the enforcement of the decree of sale and the contract of purchase. Rosenbaum v. Council Bluffs Insurance Co. (C. C.) 37 F. 724; Bradshaw v. Miners' Bank of Joplin, 81 F. 902, 26 C. C. A. 673. Clearly it is a natural and closely proximate sequence of the sale by the court, and requires the interpretation of its decree and the attempted election of the purchaser under it, and the consideration of its effort to correct the alleged inequitable result. 'A purchaser or bidder at a master's sale in chancery subjects himself quoad hoc to the jurisdiction of the court, and can be compelled to perform his agreement specifically. It would seem that he must acquire a corresponding right to appear and claim, at the hands of the court, such relief as the rules of equity proceedings entitle him to.' Blossom v. Railroad Co., \n\n[270 U.S. 107, 117]\n\u00a0\n 1 Wall. 655, 656 (17 L. Ed. 673). It is well settled that where a bill in equity is necessary to have a construction of an order or decree of a federal court, or to explain, enforce, or correct it, a bill of this kind may be entertained by the court entering the decree even though the parties interested for want of diverse citizenship could not be entitled by original bill in the federal court to have the matter there litigated.

McClelland, 44 S. Ct. 407, \n264 U.S. 552\n, 558.\n The District Court had jurisdiction and the decree dismissing the petition should be reversed. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF DOUGLAS v. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK(1926)\nNo. 279\nArgued: April 28, 1926Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harry E. Pickett and C. T. Knapp, both of Douglas, Ariz ., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. E. B. Stroud, Jr., of Dallas, Tex., for defendant in error. \n\n[271 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The county of Cochise, Arizona, on December 22, 1920, drew its check on the Central Bank of Willcox, Ariz., in favor of plaintiff in error, hereafter called plaintiff. Plaintiff delivered the check indorsed in blank to the First National Bank of Douglas, Ariz., and that bank credited plaintiff's account and passbook with the amount of the check. The passbook had printed upon its face, 'All out of town items credited subject to final payment.' The Douglas Bank indorsed the check, 'Pay to the order of the El Paso Branch, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.' which will be referred to as defendant, and forwarded it to that bank for collection.\n Defendant forwarded the check, in due time, to the drawee bank at Willcox. The latter debited the drawer's account with the amount of the check, stamped it 'Paid,' later returning it to the drawer, and transmitted to the defendant, in lieu of cash, its own check upon the Central Bank of Phoenix, in an amount covering this and other items. The last check was dishonored; both the Willcox Bank and the Central Bank of Phoenix having failed, the First National Bank of Douglas received no proceeds of the check, and charged back the amount of it to the account of plaintiff.\n Plaintiff brought suit in the District Court for Western Texas to recover the amount of the check, on the ground that defendant was negligent in accepting the check of the Willcox Bank in payment, instead of cash especially because it was chargeable with notice that both the Willcox Bank and the Phoenix Bank were then insolvent. The case was tried without a jury, and resulted in a judgment for defendant (300 F. 573), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (2 F.(2d) 818). The case comes here on writ of error. See Judicial \n\n[271 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n Code,  241; Id.  128 (Comp. St.  1218, 1120); Id.  24, First (a) being section 991, Comp. St.; Sowell v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n268 \nU.S. 449\n, 45 S. Ct. 528. Plaintiff assigns as error the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that defendant was not in such a relationship with plaintiff as to permit plaintiff to recover for the defendant's negligence.\n Both plaintiff and defendant concede that it is the rule of the federal courts that a bank which receives commercial paper for collection is not only bound to use due care itself, but is responsible to its customer for a failure to collect, resulting from the negligence or insolvency of any bank to which it transmits the check for collection. This is the so-called 'New York rule,' which in effect makes the first bank a guarantor of the solvency and diligence of the correspondents which it employs to effect the collection. Exchange Nat. Bank v. Third Nat. Bank, \n112 \nU.S. 276\n, 5 S. Ct. 141. And see Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160, 164\n, 44 S. Ct. 296, 31 A. L. R. 1261, for a comparison of this rule of liability with the 'Massachusetts rule,' by which the initial bank is liable only for its failure to exercise due care in the selection of an agent to make the collection. Under the Massachusetts rule the agent selected becomes the agent of the owner of the paper, who may maintain an action directly against it for the negligent performance of its undertaking. See Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra, 164 (44 S. Ct. 296). Compare Bank of Washington v. Triplett, 1 Pet. 25, where the undertaking of the initial bank was to transmit paper for collection.\n From this the defendant argues that, under the rule applied in the federal courts, the First National Bank of Douglas became liable by its contract with plaintiff for the negligence of the defendant; hence that there was no privity of contract between plaintiff and defendant, and no basis for a recovery, even though defendant was negligent in accepting an exchange check from the Willcox Bank. See Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra, 164 (44 S. Ct. 296). \n\n[271 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n This was the view taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but the plaintiff objects that it is not a necessary corollary of the New York rule, applied in Exchange National Bank v. Third Nat. Bank, supra, that one who deposits paper for collection may not proceed against a correspondent, selected by the initial bank for that purpose, for negligent failure to make the collection, and that neither Exchange Nat. Bank v. Third Nat. Bank nor Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy so held. It objects, also, that in any event the rule is not applicable here, because of the stipulation appearing on the face of the passbook: 'All out of town items credited subject to final payment.'\n It is said that the effect of this language was to relieve the initial bank, the First National Bank of Douglas, from the liability which would otherwise have resulted under the New York rule, and to make it a mere agent to transmit the paper to defendant for collection, and thus to make applicable the Massachusetts rule. See Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra. In that case, a local statute relieved the bank receiving paper for collection from any liability, except that of due care in selecting a subagent for collection and in transmitting the paper to it, and it was held that the owner of the paper might proceed against the subagent for negligent failure to collect the paper.\n It is not necessary to decide any of these questions here, for when paper is indorsed without restriction by a depositor, and is at once passed to his credit by the bank to which he delivers it, he becomes the creditor of the bank; the bank becomes owner of the paper, and in making the collection is not the agent for the depositor.

The meaning of this language, as the cashier of the Douglas Bank testified, and as the court below held, was that, if the check was not paid on presentation, it was to be charged back to plaintiff's account. The check was paid, and the drawer and indorsers discharged. Malloy v. Federal Reserve Bank (D. C.) 281 F. 997; Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160, 166\n, 44 S. Ct. 296, 31 A. L.

Without these words, the relationship between the plaintiff and the bank was that of indorser and indorsee; and their use here did not vary the legal rights and liabilities incident to that relationship, unless it dispensed with notice of dishonor to the depositor. As was said by the court in Burton v. United States, supra, 297 (25 S. Ct. 246):\n'The testimony ... as to the custom of the bank, when a check was not paid, of charging it up against the depositor's account, did not in the least vary the legal effect of the transaction; it was simply a method pursued by the bank of exacting payment from the indorser of the check, and nothing more. There was nothing whatever in the evidence showing any agreement or understanding as to the effect of the transaction between the parties-the defendant and the bank-making it other than such as the law would imply from the facts already stated.'\n\n While there is not entire uniformity of opinion, the weight of authority supports the view that upon the deposit of paper unrestrictedly indorsed, and credit of the amount to the depositor's account, the bank becomes the owner of the paper, notwithstanding a custom or agreement to charge the paper back to the depositor in the event of dishonor.

W. 848; Packing Co. v. Davis, 118 N. C. 548, 24 S. E. 365.\n Plaintiff having thus surrendered its rights in the paper, only rights arising out of its contract with the initial bank remained. If those rights were affected by the act or omission of defendant, they were affected only because that contract so stipulated. Defendant's duties arose out of its contract with the initial bank, or out of its relation to that bank as owner of the paper. Hence there was no relationship between plaintiff and defendant which could be made the basis of recovery for defendant's want of diligence.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLE v.

Henderson and Cyrus Crane, both of Kansas City, Mo., for appellants.\n Messrs. William A. Franken and S. J. Jones, both of Carrollton, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill to restrain the collection of a tax and entry upon the plaintiffs' lands in pursuance of a plan of drainage established in the mode provided by the laws of Missouri. The grounds on which relief is sought are that section 40 of the Drainage Laws of 1913 (Laws 1913, p. 254 ), under which the plaintiffs' lands were brought into the drainage district, is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the inclusion of their lands was an arbitrary exercise of power for the purpose of making the plaintiffs pay for benefits that they did not share. The District Court found that there was no arbitrary exercise of power, but only a decision upon disputable questions of benefit with regard to land all of which was Missouri bottom land, similar in condition in everything but degree. It upheld the inclusion of the plaintiffs' land. In view of the constitutional question raised the plaintiffs appealed directly to this Court. \n\n[270 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n Under the laws of the State a drainage district was incorporated which originally contained, it is said, 14,400 acres. In a later year, upon petition of the supervisors of the district, the boundaries were enlarged in due statutory form so as to take in nearly 24,000 acres more of adjoining land, including that now concerned. It is not disputed that the original district was lawful in all respects. In general there can be no doubt that a State has power to add more land that shares the benefit of a scheme, to the lawfully constituted district that has to pay for it, and to do so against the will of the owner. Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 36 S. Ct. 58; Squaw Creek Drainage District v. Turney, 235 Mo. 80, 138 S. W. 12; Mudd v. St. Francis Drainage District, 117 Ark. 30, 173 S. W. 825; Faithorn v. Thompson, 242 Ill. 508, 90 N. E. 303.\n But it is objected that as in this case the original district was formed on the petition of the 'owners of a majority of the acreage' in contiguous lands, and as, under the statute, the concurrence of the owners of a majority of the acreage was necessary, there is an unconstitutional discrimination in not leaving it to a similar majority to determine whether the new land shall come in. It seems strange if the power of the Legislature to add to a lawfully existing district depends on how that district was formed many years before. But it is enough to repeat the answer of the appellees. The original incorporators take the risk of a plan and agree to pay for it while as yet they do not know exactly what that the plan will be or what the benefits. If after the plan is made and started it becomes obvious that other contiguous land will be benefited, it is just that such land should help to pay the bills. But only an Eighteenth Century faith in human nature could expect that the owners would vote to come in and pay their shares when they would get the same benefit if they stayed out. The discrimination is justified by the change in position at the later time. \n\n[270 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n As to the supposed sinister purpose of those who brought the plaintiffs in, no evidence was given to prove it. That the plaintiffs' land would be benefited has been found by the Circuit Court of Carroll County, Missouri, which made the order, and by the District Court below. We see no reason in the evidence for not accepting their findings. There is another objection to inquiring further. By the law of Missouri the decree of the Circuit Court is final with regard to the territorial extent of the district. The bill further states that the plaintiffs have sought redress in the courts of the State without avail. The defendants plead that the plaintiffs sued in a State Court to cancel the assessments upon them and to annul the judgment of the Circuit Court; that thereupon the defendants applied to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition, and that the Court made the prohibition absolute, upholding the constitutionality of the law. State ex rel. Norborne Land Drainage District v. Hughes, 294 Mo. 1, 240 S. W. 802. The defendants urge these facts to show that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law by bringing either the judgment of the Circuit Court or that of the Supreme Court here. It is hard to see why these decisions do not make the question sought to be opened here res judicata, although not so pleaded. But in any event we see no ground for disturbing the decree below. The District Court rightly held that the plaintiffs Hellwig and Summers must fail for the additional reason that the assessments against them were less than the jurisdictional amount, but this is not very important as on the merits the bill must be dismissed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM.

The case was heard upon bill and answer and the report of a special master appointed to take proofs and to make an advisory report upon the questions of fact raised by the pleadings, except as to the amount of damages to be paid for the property if taken by eminent domain.\n The land in dispute is a narrow strip of about 25 acres fronting upon Lake Ontario within the city limits of Rochester. By the Treaty of Hartford, entered into between New York and Massachusetts December 16, 1786, land within the territorial limits of New York was granted to Massachusetts in private ownership. The title to the land in controversy depends upon the meaning and effect of this treaty, and upon the construction of a subsequent conveyance by Massachusetts of a part of the land thus acquired, through which conveyance the several defendants other than the state of New York derive their title.\n Before 1786 Massachusetts and New York claimed, under conflicting royal grants, both sovereignty and title of a large area of what is now western New York. The controversy was settled by the Treaty of Hartford by which Massachusetts gave up all its claim to sovereignty over the territory, and its claim to private ownership in part of it, and New York ceded to Massachusetts-\n'the Right of pre-emption of the Soil from the native Indians and all other the Estate, Right, Title and Property (the Right and Title of Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction excepted) which the State of New York hath ... in or to all the Lands and Territories within the following Limits and Bounds that is to say, BEGINNING in the north boundary Line of the State \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 82]\n\u00a0\n of Pennsylvania in the parallel of forty-two degrees of north Latitude at a point distant eighty-two miles west from the north east Corner of the state of Pennsylvania on Delaware River as the said boundary Line hath been run and marked by the Commissioners appointed by the States of Pennsylvania and New York respectively and from the said Point or Place of beginning running on a due meridian north to the boundary Line between the United States of America and the king of Great Britain thence westerly and southerly along the said boundary Line to a meridian which will pass one mile due East from the northern Termination of the Streight or waters between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie thence South along the said Meridian to the South Shore of Lake Ontario thence on the eastern side of the said Streight by a Line always one mile distant from and parallel to the said Streight to Lake Erie thence due west to the boundary Line between the United States and the king of Great Britain thence along the said boundary Line until it meets with the Line of Cession from the State of New York to the United States thence along the said Line of Cession to the northwest corner of the State of Pennsylvama and thence East along the northern boundary Line of the State of Pennsylvania to the said place of beginning.'\n\n Article 10 of the Treaty provided that Massachusetts might grant the right of pre-emption in the lands thus acquired, 'to any person or persons who by virtue of such Grant shall have good right to extinguish by purchase the claims of the native Indians,' by compliance with certain conditions not now important.\n By act of the Massachusetts Legislature, approved April 1, 1788 (Laws and Res. 1786-87, c. 135, p. 900), it was provided that 'this Commonwealth doth hereby agree, to grant, sell & convey' to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, for a purchase price stated in the act, 'all the Right, Title & Demand, which the said Commonwealth \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 83]\n\u00a0\n has in & to the said Western Territory' ceded to it by the Treaty of Hartford. On July 8, 1788, the Five Indian Nations (Mohawks, Oneidas, Onandagas, Cayugas, and Senecas) executed a deed or treaty extinguishing the Indian claim to the territory described in it and conveying that territory to Phelps and Gorham. The description embraces approximately the east one-third of the territory ceded to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford, and begins at a point 'in the north boundary line of the State of Pennsylvania in the parallel of forty-two degrees north latitude at a point distant eighty-two miles west from the northeast corner of Pennsylvania on Delaware river.' The description proceeds by various metes and bounds to a point on the Genesee river from which, so far as now material, it reads as follows:\n'... Thence running in a direction due west twelve miles, thence running in a direction northwardly, so as to be twelve miles distant from the most westward bends of said Genesee River to the shore of the Ontario Lake thence eastwardly along the shores of said Lake to a meridian which will pass through the first point or place of beginning. ...'\n\n By legislative act (Laws and Res. 1788-89, c. 23, p. 35), approved November 21, 1788, the commonwealth of Massachusetts granted to Phelps and Gorham the land which had been conveyed by the deed or treaty with the Five Tribes, the description of the land conveyed being, so far as it is now material, identical with that in the conveyance from the Five Tribes, which we have quoted. By treaty between the Six Nations and the United States, executed November 11, 1794, known as the Pickering Treaty (7 Stat. 44), the Indians formally disclaimed any rights in the land lying east of the west line of the Phelps and Gorham tract.\n The several corporate and individual defendants who are in possession of or claim an interest in land now in \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 84]\n\u00a0\n controversy, derive their title, through mesne conveyances, from Phelps and Gorham, who took under the grants last described, from the Five Tribes and from the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and Massachusetts is not entitled to relief in this suit unless title in the locus quo was acquired by it by the Treaty of Hartford and remained in it after its grant to Phelps and Gorham.\n After the Act approved November 21, 1788, Phelps and Gorham having failed to pay the purchase price stipulated in the Resolve of April 1, 1788, a settlement of the contract or agreement between them and the commonwealth of Massachusetts was effected. By this they retained the easterly one-third of the lands which had been released and confirmed to them by the Five Tribes and later conveyed to them by the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and they released and quitclaimed to the commonwealth all their right and title in the remainder of the land.\n It is established that since the grant to Phelps and Gorham, there has been a shifting of the shore line of Lake Ontario, and that the land now in dispute, which certainly in 1803 and probably at the time of the Phelps and Gorham grant, was under water, north of the shore line of Lake Ontario, is now above water and south of the high-water mark of the lake. Whether the change in the shore line and in the physical condition of the land in question was due wholly to accretion, or partly to accretion and partly to filling, does not clearly appear, and in the view we take of the case is not material.\n The argument of the commonwealth of Massachusetts is that the legal effect of the Hartford Treaty was to release and convey to Massachusetts within the limits of the description in the grant, the bed of Lake Ontario as it then existed, and that by the treaty it acquired title to the land now in dispute; that its grant to Phelps and Gorham, bounding the land conveyed by a line running 'to the Shore of the Ontario Lake; thence eastwardly \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 85]\n\u00a0\n along the Shores of the said Lake,' carried only to high-water mark; and that title to all the land below high-water mark as it then existed remained in Massachusetts. Even though this contention that the bed of the lake vested in Massachusetts be decided against it, Massachusetts nevertheless takes the position that the land in dispute was due to accretion, and that all the benefits of the accretion accrued to Massachusetts, because it did acquire title to the shore of the lake by the Treaty of Hartford, and did not part with the title to the shore by its grant to Phelps and Gorham.\n The first question which must receive our consideration is whether Massachusetts acquired any title to the bed of Lake Ontario by the Treaty of Hartford. That treaty contained three principal clauses of cession. One granted to New York 'all the claim right and Title which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts hath to the Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction' in all the lands in controversy between the two states. The second granted to Massachusetts 'the right of preemption of the soil from the native Indians all other the estate, right, title and property (the right and title of government, sovereignty and jurisdiction excepted)' of the state of New York in that part of the land the description of which has already been set forth in detail, and which included that part of the bed of the lake lying within the east and west boundaries of the tract ceded, and south of the international boundary. By the third, with which we are not now concerned, Massachusetts gave up and ceded to New York its claim to private ownership in the remainder of the land in controversy.\n The English possessions in America were claimed by right of discovery. The rights of property and dominion in the lands discovered by those acting under royal authority were held to vest in the crown, which under the principles of the British Constitution was deemed to hold \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 86]\n\u00a0\n them as a part of the public domain for the benefit of the nation. Upon these principles rest the various English royal charters and grants of territory on the continent of North America. Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 577 et seq., 595. As a result of the Revolution, the people of each state became sovereign, and in that capacity acquired the rights of the crown in the public domain (Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410), and it was by the exercise of their sovereign power as states that New York and Massachusetts undertook to make disposition of a portion of their public domain by the grants contained in the Treaty of Hartford.\n The effect of the grant made to Massachusetts in the treaty, so far as concerns the question now presented, depends upon the interpretation of the restrictive language excepting from the operation of the grant the 'right and Title of Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction' of New York, and of the cotemporaneous grant by Mssachusetts to New York of 'all the claim right and Title which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts hath to the Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction' over all the lands in controversy. We have to decide whether the grant and reservation to New York of sovereign rights vested or reserved in New York the title to the bed of the navigable waters lying within the exterior limits of the grant made by it to Massachusetts in the same instrument.\n The question is not the vexed one argued at the bar whether there was power in New York to grant the soil beneath its navigable waters in private ownership. Compare Martin v. Waddell, supra, page 410. We need not consider here whether, in such circumstances, there is a limitation on the power of a sovereign state to grant its public domain, nor the nature and extent of the limitation if it exists, for in our view the meaning of the grant itself determines the principal question which we have to decide.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 65, 87]\n\u00a0\n In ascertaining that meaning, not only must regard be had to the technical significance of the words used in the grants, but they must be interpreted 'with a view to public convenience, and the avoidance of controversy,' and 'the great object, where it can be distinctly perceived, ought not to be defeated by those technical perplexities which may sometimes influence contracts between individuals'. Marshall, C. J., in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374, 383, 384. The applicable principles of English law then well understood, the object of the grant, contemporaneous construction of it and usage under it for more than a century, all are to be given consideration and weight. Martin v. Waddell, supra.\n The grant made by New York to Massachusetts embraced a vast domain extending more than 140 miles from east to west, and from the northern boundary of Pennsylvania to the Canadian line, comprising about 6,000,000 acres of land, largely an unsettled wilderness inhabited by Indians, to which the navigable waters of Lake Ontario were the principal means of access. The purpose of it was, while reserving and securing to New York its rights as a sovereign state in the granted territory, to confer upon Massachusetts the right of pre-emption of the soil from the Indians, and to enable it to make sale of the lands to settlers by conferring on it the power to grant this right of pre-emption.\n It does not appear that the Indians ever had or claimed any rights to the soil under the lake, or that any attempt was made by Massachusetts or those claiming under it to exercise the granted right of pre-emption with respect to the bed of the lake. Nor is there anything to indicate that either party to the treaty contemplated grants of the soil under the water, or intended any such limitation upon the sovereign rights of New York over navigable waters within its territory, as necessarily would have resulted from the grant in private ownership of lands under water. \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 88]\n\u00a0\n It would be difficult to suggest any purpose which the high contracting parties could have had in mind which would have been furthered by a grant to Massachusetts of a fee in the bed of the lake. The right of Massachusetts and her grantees to use the waters of the lake was amply secured and protected by a clause of the treaty, which provided that:\n'Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall ... at all times hereafter have and enjoy the same and equal Rights respecting the navigation and fishery on and in Lake Ontario and Lake Erie and the Waters communicating from, one to the other ... as shall from time to time be had and enjoyed by the Citizens of the State of New York. ...'\n\n On the other hand, a grant of the soil under water in private ownership would have set material limits on the free exercise of the sovereign control of New York over the navigable waters of the state and on the free use of the principal waterway of the newly settled territory. All these considerations lead to the conclusion that the grants in the Treaty of Hartford did not convey to Massachusetts, which took in private ownership, any title in the bed of the lake, unless the technical language employed in the grants compels us to take an opposite view.\n The fact that the northern limit of the grant to Massachusetts was described as the international boundary, and not the edge of the lake, is not inconsistent with our view of the general purpose of the grant with respect to the lands under water. A map in evidence antedating the treaty shows numerous islands in Lake Ontario within the described area. It was unquestionably the purpose to grant the right of pre-emption of all the islands and, in order to include them, it was necessary to extend the description to the international boundary line. Moreover, it was the avowed purpose of the treaty to settle all controversies with respect to the area described, and these included conflicting claims of sovereignty as well as \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 89]\n\u00a0\n disputes with respect to proprietary rights. It was necessary, therefore, to make the international boundary a descriptive term in the grants and reservations whereby sovereignty and jurisdiction over the entire tract were being adjusted.\n It is a principle derived from the English common law and firmly established in this country that the title to the soil under navigable waters is in the sovereign, except so far as private rights in it have been acquired by express grant or prescription. Shively v. Bowlby, 14 S. Ct. 548, \n152 U.S. 1\n. The rule is applied both to the territory of the United States (Shively v. Bowlby, supra) and to land within the confines of the states, whether they are original states ( Johnson v. M'Intosh, supra; Martin v. Waddell, supra) or states admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution (United States v. Holt State Bank, 46 S. Ct. 197, \n270 U.S. 49\n). The dominion over navigable waters and property in the soil under them, are so identified with the exercise of the sovereign powers of government that a presumption against their separation from sovereignty must be indulged, in construing all grants by the sovereign, of lands to be held in private ownership. Martin v. Waddell; Shively v. Bowlby, supra. Such grants are peculiarly subject to the rule, applicable generally, that all grants by or to a sovereign government as distinguished from private grants, must be construed so as to diminish the public rights of the sovereign only so far as is made necessary by an unavoidable construction. Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 544, 548; Shively v. Bowlby, supra. It follows that wherever there is a grant by a state having plenary power to make it, of the rights and title of government and sovereignty over a specified territory, or where, in a grant of land to be held in private ownership by one state within the limits of another, there is a reservation to the grantor state of these sovereign rights, the grant or reservation carries with it, as an incident, title to lands under navigable waters. \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 90]\n\u00a0\n The precise question now under consideration was before this court in Martin v. Waddell, supra. That case involved the title to lands under tidal waters within the territorial limits of New Jersey, which were embraced within the territory granted by royal charters to the Duke of York. By successive conveyances, these lands had been transferred to 24 individuals, the proprietors of East New Jersey, who were invested with the plenary rights and powers of government and ownership which had been conferred on the Duke of York by the original grants. In 1702 by formal instrument, the proprietors surrendered to the crown all their rights and powers of government, retaining their rights of private property in the granted territory.\n It was held, in an opinion by Chief Justice Taney, that the relinquishment by the proprietors to the crown, of the rights and powers of government vested in them, carried with it as an incident the title to land under tidal waters; that that title and ownership had passed to the state of New Jersey as an incident to its sovereignty over the territory embraced in the royal grants, and excluded all claims of title to lands under navigable waters by those claiming under grants by the proprietors. The reasoning of the opinion was addressed wholly to the proper interpretation to be placed upon grants or reservations of rights of sovereignty with respect to their operation to transfer title of lands under navigable waters; and it is decisive of this case. It compels the conclusion, which is supported by every consideration that could throw light upon the purpose and intent of the Treaty of Hartford, that the proper construction of the technical language of the treaty (which both granted and reserved to New York the right and title of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the area described) gave to New York, as incident to its sovereignty, title to all lands under navigable waters. See Pollard's Lessees v. Hagan, 3 How. 212; Coxe v. State, 39 N. E. 400, N. Y. 396, 406. \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 91]\n\u00a0\n We pass now to the contention of Massachusetts that, even if it did not acquire title to the bed of the lake, it did acquire title to the shore of the lake by the Treaty of Hartford, and that it is entitled to the benefit of all accretion to the shore because it has never parted with its title. This contention depends upon the interpretation of the language of its grant to Phelps and Gorham, of lands bounded by a line described as extending 'to the Shore of the Ontario Lake; thence eastwardly along the Shores of the said Lake'; and it can be sustained only if we conclude that notwithstanding the nature of the grant and the circumstances under which it was made, Massachusetts, after its execution, retained a narrow and undefined ribbon of land extending some 40 miles along the lake front, north of the Phelps and Gorham grant, and separating the latter from the lake.\n That grant embraced more than 2,000,000 acres of unsettled land, for the development of which access to the lake was essential. It was made pursuant to the agreement of 1787 between Massachusetts and Phelps and Gorham to convey to them all of the property which Massachusetts had acquired under the Treaty of Hartford and pursuant to the Treaty of the Five Nations with Phelps and Gorham of July 8, 1788, purporting to extinguish the Indian claims to 'All that territory or Country of land lying within the State of New York contained within & being parcel of the lands and territory, the right of preemption of the soil whereof from the native Indians was ceded by the State of New York' to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford. There is no conceivable purpose for which it could be supposed that Massachusetts intended to retain such a proprietary interest in the shore as is now claimed, or to deny to its grantees and to settlers in the granted territory access to the great natural waterway upon its northern boundary. We are not dealing here with the disposition of the jus publicum, but with \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 92]\n\u00a0\n land held by Massachusetts in private ownership and granted by it to private persons. See Georgia v. Chattanooga, 44 S. Ct. 369, \n264 U.S. 472\n. It would require clear and unequivocal language so to limit the obvious general purpose and effect of the grant.\n In order thus to restrict its operation, Massachusetts relies on the use of the words 'to the Shore' and 'along the Shores,' instead of 'to the lake' and 'along the lake,' which concededly would have carried to the water's edge; and it is argued that the same effect must be given to these words as when they are used in conveyances granting land bounded by the shore of tidal waters. In this connection, it should be observed that in the Treaty of Hartford the words 'shore' and 'lake' were used synonymously, their choice being determined by convenience of expression. For example, the western boundary in the treaty was described as running from the international boundary line in the middle of Lake Ontario 'to the South Shore of Lake Ontario' and thence continuing south 'to Lake Erie.' In each instance it is clear that the margin of the lake was intended, and it was not meant by the particular use of these phrases to exclude 'the shore' from the grant.\n The 'seashore' is that well-defined area, lying between high-water mark and the low-water mark, of waters in which the tide daily ebbs and flows. The fact that by the English common law, and by the law of those states bounded by tidal waters, the public has rights in the seashore, and that grants extending only to the high-water mark of such waters nevertheless give access to the sea, accounts for the rule, generally recognized and followed, that a grant whose boundaries extend to the 'shore' or 'along the shore' of the sea, carries only to highwater mark. Howard v. Ingersoll, 13 How. 381; Storer v. Freeman, 6 Mass. 435, 4 Am. Dec. 155; Shively v. Bowlby, supra; Kean v. Stetson, 5 Pick, ( Mass.) 492; Cortelyou v. Van Brundt, 2 Johns. (N. Y.) 357, 3 Am. Dec. 439. But the word 'shore,' even in its application to tidal \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 93]\n\u00a0\n waters, is subject to construction by the terms of the deed and surrounding circumstances, and may mean the water's edge at low-water mark. Storer v. Freeman, supra; Hathaway v. Wilson, 123 Mass. 359; Haskell v. Friend, 81 N. E. 962, 196 Mass. 198.\n The application of that rule to conveyances of land bordering upon non-tidal waters is supported by neither reason nor authority. The lack of clear definition, by natural landmarks, of the shore of non-tidal waters, woudl make its application impracticable. It would deny to grantees all access to such waters except on the irregular and infrequent occasions of flood, since there are no public rights in the shores of non-tidal waters, and the abutting owner could not cross the shore to the water without trespass. Such a result would contravene public policy waters, would make its application impracticable. conveyances are normally made. New York has consistently refused to apply the rule to non-tidal waters, holding that a conveyance 'to the shore' or 'along the shore' of such waters carries to the water's edge at low water (Child v. Starr, 4 Hill. 369, 375, 376; Halsey v. McCormick, 13 N. Y. 296; Yates v. Van De Bogert, 56 N. Y. 526; Stewart v. Turney, 142 N. E. 437, 237 N. Y. 117, 131, 31 A. L. R. 960), and the local rules for interpreting conveyances should be applied by this court in the absence of an expression of a different purpose (Hardin v. Jordan, 11 S. Ct. 808, 838, \n140 U.S. 371\n, 384; Oklahoma v. Texas, 42 S. Ct. 406, \n258 U.S. 574\n, 594; Brewer-Elliott Oil Co. v. United States, 43 S. Ct. 60, \n260 U.S. 77\n, 88). The same rule is, however, generally followed elsewhere. See Castle v. Elder, 59 N. W. 197, 57 Minn. 289; Lamb v. Rickets, 11 Ohio, 311; Daniels v. Cheshire R. R., 20 N. H. 85; Kanouse v. Slockbower, 21 A. 197, 48 N. J. Eq. 42, 50; Seaman v. Smith, 24 Ill. 521; Slauson v. Goodrich Transp. Co., 69 N. W. 990, 94 Wis. 642; Burke v. Niles, 13 New Bruns. 166; Stover v. Lavoia, 8 Ont. W. R. 398.\n Upon neither of the theories advanced, therefore, does the commonwealth of Massachusetts sustain its claim to the land in question. \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 94]\n\u00a0\n It any further support were required for the conclusion which we reach, it is to be found in the practical construction by the two states of the Treaty of Hartford and of the grants made by Massachusetts immediately following it, and in long-continued acquiescence by Massachusetts in that construction. After the relinquishment by Phelps and Gorham to Massachusetts, of all claim to the westerly two-thirds of the land acquired by Massachusetts under the Treaty of Hartford, Massachusetts, by resolution of its Legislature of March 8, 1791 (Laws and Res. 1790-91, c. 121, p. 221), bargained to sell to Samuel Ogden all the title and interest which the commonwealth then had in the land granted to it by the state of New York, except such parts of the land as then belonged to Phelps and Gorham. Robert Morris succeeded to such rights as Ogden had under this contract. Five several conveyances to Morris, embracing the westerly two-thirds of the tract, were made by a committee appointed for that purpose, and the report of the committee, describing these conveyances in detail, was approved by resolution of the Massachusetts Legislature of June 17, 1991 (Laws and Res. 1790-1791, c. 65, p. 416). This resolution recited that the committee had been appointed with authority 'to sell & convey ... the right of pre-emption, & other the title & interest of the Commonwealth to that part of the lands lying in the State of New-York, the right of pre-emption whereof the said State of New-York had ceded to this Common-wealth, & which had not been by them before otherwise ceded or granted.' Although the descriptions in the deeds were so drawn as to exclude from their operation any lands lying east of the western bounds of the Phelps and Gorham grant, this resolution was a clear recognition by the Massachusetts Legislature (as were also the recitals in the several deeds by this committee to Morris) that Massachusetts retained no interest in the shore or in the \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 95]\n\u00a0\n bed of Lake Ontario east of the westerly boundary of the Phelps and Gorham grant. The deed of the most easterly land conveyed to Robert Morris describes it as bounded on the north by the international boundary line and on the east by lands 'confirmed to Nathaniel Gorham and Oliver Phelps,' but makes no mention of and land on the east belonging to Massachusetts, as would have been appropriate if it had retained any interest in the shore line, east of the land granted to Morris.\n In 1797 Morris obtained from the Indians a grant of their right to all such part of the lands ceded by New York to Massachusetts 'as is not included in the Indian purchase made by Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham,' and in a resolve of the Massachusetts Legislature passed March 8, 1804 ( Laws and Res. 1803-04, c. 155, p. 939), this Treaty of Morris with the Indians is referred to as having been made with the authority of Massachusetts and as having extinguished all the Indian rights in the land referred to.\n There is no evidence of any official act or any expression of the general court or the Legislature of Masachusetts or of any official of the commonwealth from the time of the Phelps and Gorham grant until the commencement of the present suit, which suggests that Massachusetts had reserved or retained any interest whatever in land under Lake Ontario or upon its shores within the boundaries of that grant. So far as appears, the public authorities of New York have continuously treated the property as other property in the state and as not encumbered by any claim or title of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n Long acquiescence in the possession of territory and the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it may have a controlling effect in the determination of a disputed boundary. Indiana v. Kentucky, 10 S. Ct. 1051, \n136 U.S. 479\n; Michigan v. Wisconsin, 46 S. Ct. 290, \n270 U.S. 295\n. Even though the Treaty of \n\n[271 U.S. 65, 96]\n\u00a0\n Hartford provided 'that no adverse possession of the said lands for any length of time shall be adjudged a disseisin of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,' it does not affect the interpretation by Massachusetts of her own deeds and acts, or her long-continued acquiescence in that interpretation as persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence of the correctness of the construction which we place upon the deeds themselves.\n The complainant has failed to sustain its claim of title to the land in question. The decree will therefore be for the defendants, and since no public boundary or public ownership was involved, costs are awarded against the complainant. The parties, or either of them if so advised, may, within 30 days, submit the form of a decree to carry this opinion into effect; failing which a decree dismissing the bill, with costs to the defendants, will be entered.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONNALLY v. GENERAL CONST. CO.(1926)\nNo. 314\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. George F. Short, of Oklahoma City, Okl., and J. Berry King, of Muskogee, Okl., for appellants.[ Connally v. General Const. Co. \n269 U.S. 385\n (1926) ]\n\n\n[269 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. D. Lydick, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin certain state and county officers of Oklahoma from enforcing the provisions of section 7255 and section 7257, Compiled Oklahoma Statutes 1921, challenged as unconstitutional. Section 7255 creates an eight-hour day for all persons employed by or on behalf of the state, etc., and provides:\n'That not less than the current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed shall be paid to laborers, workmen, mechanics, prison guards, janitors in public institutions, or other persons so employed by or on behalf of the state, ... and laborers, workmen, mechanics, or other persons employed by contractors or subcontractors in the execution of any contract or contracts with the state, ... shall be deemed to be employed by or on behalf of the state. ...'\n\n For any violation of the section, a penalty is imposed by section 7257 of a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500, or imprisonment for not less than three nor more than six months. Each day that the violation continues is declared to be a separate offense. \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n The material averments of the bill, shortly stated, are to the following effect: The construction company, under contracts with the state, is engaged in constructing certain bridges within the state. In such work, it employs a number of laborers, workmen, and mechanics, with each of whom it has agreed as to the amount of wages to be paid upon the basis of an eight-hour day, and the amount so agreed upon is reasonable and commensurate with the services rendered and agreeable to the employee in each case.\n The Commissioner of Labor complained that the rate of wages paid by the company to laborers was only $3.20 per day, whereas, he asserted, the current rate in the locality where the work was being done was $3.60, and gave notice that, unless advised of an intention immediately to comply with the law, action would be taken to enforce compliance. From the correspondence set forth in the bill, it appears that the commissioner based his complaint upon an investigation made by his representative concerning wages 'paid to laborers in the vicinity of Cleveland,' Okl., near which town one of the bridges was being constructed. This investigation disclosed the following list of employers with the daily rate of wages paid by each: City, $3.60 and $4; Johnson Refining Co., $3. 60 and $4.05; Prairie Oil & Gas, $4; Gypsy Oil Co., $4; Gulf Pipe Line Co ., $4; Brickyard, $3 and $4; I. Hansen, $3.60; General Construction Company, $3.20; Moore & Pitts Ice Company, $100 per month; cotton gins, $3. 50 and $4; Mr. Pitts, $4; Prairie Pipe Line Company, $4; C. B. McCormack, $ 3; Harry McCoy, $3. The scale of wages paid by the construction company to its laborers was stated to be as follows: Six men at $3.20 per day, 7 men at $3.60, 4 men at $4.00, 2 men at $4.40, 4 men at $4.80, 1 man at $5.20, and 1 man at $6.50.\n In determining the rate of wages to be paid by the company, the commissioner claimed to be acting under \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n authority of a statute of Oklahoma, which imposes upon him the duty of carrying into effect all laws in relation to labor. In the territory surrounding the bridges being constructed by plaintiff, there is a variety of work performed by laborers, etc., the value of whose services depends upon the class and kind of labor performed and the efficiency of the workmen. Neither the wages paid nor the work performed are uniform. Wages have varied since plaintiff entered into its contracts for constructing the bridges and employing its men, and it is impossible to determine under the circumstances whether the sums paid by the plaintiff or the amount designated by the commissioner or either of them constitute the current per diem wage in the locality. Further averments are to the effect that the commissioner has threatened the company, and its officers, agents, and representatives, with criminal prosecutions under the foregoing statutory provisions, and, unless restrained, the county attorneys for various counties named will institute such prosecutions; and that, under section 7257, providing that each day's failure to pay current wages shall constitute a separate offense, maximum penalties may be inflicted aggregating many thousands of dollars in fines and many years of imprisonment.\n The constitutional grounds of attack, among others, are that the statutory provisions, if enforced, will deprive plaintiff, its officers, agents and representatives, of their liberty and property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution; that they contain no ascertainable standard of guilt; that it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty what sum constitutes a current wage in any locality; and that the term 'locality' itself is fatally vague and uncertain. The bill is a long one, and, without further review, it is enough to say that, if the constitutional attack upon the statute be sustained, the averments justify the equitable relief prayed. \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n Upon the bill and a motion to dismiss it, in the nature of a demurrer attacking its sufficiency, an application for an interlocutory injunction was heard by a court of three judges, under section 266, Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1243), and granted; the allegations of the bill being taken as true. General Const. Co. v. Connally (D. C.) 3 F. (2d) 666.\n That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties is a well- recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 34 S. Ct. 853; Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 634, 638\n, 34 S. Ct. 924\n\n\n The question whether given legislative enactments have been thus wanting in certainty has frequently been before this court. In some of the cases the statutes involved were upheld; in others, declared invalid. The precise point of differentiation in some instances is not easy of statement; but it will be enough for present purposes to say generally that the decisions of the court, upholding statutes as sufficiently certain, rested upon the conclusion that they employed words or phrases having a technical or other special meaning, well enough known to enable those within their reach to correctly apply them, Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 45 S. Ct. 141; Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 323, or a well-settled common-law meaning, notwithstanding an element of degree in the definition as to which estimates might differ, Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 33 S. Ct. 780; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, supra, at page 223 (34 S. Ct. 853), or, as broadly stated by Mr. Chief Justice White in United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81, 92\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 301 (65 L. Ed. 516, 14 A. L. R. 1045), 'that, for reasons found to \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n result either from the text of the statutes involved or the subjects with which they dealt, a standard of some sort was afforded.' See also, Waters- Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1), \n212 \nU.S. 86, 108\n, 29 S. Ct. 220. Illustrative cases on the other hand are International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, supra, Collins v. Kentucky, supra, and United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., supra, and cases there cited. The Cohen Grocery Case involved the validity of section 4 of the Food Control Act of 1917 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ff), which imposed a penalty upon any person who should make 'any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge, in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries.' It was held that these words fixed no ascertainable standard of guilt, in that they forbade no specific or definite act.\n Among the cases cited in support of that conclusion is United States v. Capital Traction Co., 34 App. D. C. 592, 19 Ann. Cas. 68, where a statute making it an offense for any street railway company to run an insufficient number of cars to accommodate passengers 'without crowding' was held to be void for uncertainty. In the course of its opinion, that court said (pages 596, 598):\n'The statute makes it a criminal offense for the street railway companies in the District of Columbia to run an insufficient number of cars to accommodate persons desiring passage thereon, without crowding the same. What shall be the guide to the court or jury in ascertaining what constitutes a crowded car? What may be regarded as a crowded car by one jury may not be so considered by another. What shall constitute a sufficient number of cars in the opinion of one judge may be regarded as insufficient by another. ... There is a total absence of any definition of what shall constitute a crowded car. This important element cannot be left to conjecture, or be supplied by either the court or the jury. It is of the very essence of the law itself, and without it the statute is too indefinite and uncertain to support an information or indictment.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n ... The dividing line between what is lawful and unlawful cannot be left to conjecture. The citizen cannot be held to answer charges based upon penal statutes whose mandates are so uncertain that they will reasonably admit of different constructions. A criminal statute cannot rest upon an uncertain foundation. The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue. Penal statutes prohibiting the doing of certain things, and providing a punishment for their violation, should not admit of such a double meaning that the citizen may act upon the one conception of its requirements and the courts upon another.'\n In the light of these principles and decisions, then, we come to the consideration of the legislation now under review, requiring the contractor, at the risk of incurring severe and cumulative penalties, to pay his employees 'not less than the current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed.'\n We are of opinion that this provision presents a double uncertainty, fatal to its validity as a criminal statute. In the first place, the words 'current rate of wages' do not denote a specific or definite sum, but minimum, maximum, and intermediate amounts, indeterminately, varying from time to time and dependent upon the class and kind of work done, the efficiency of the workmen, etc., as the bill alleges is the case in respect of the territory surrounding the bridges under construction. \n1\n The statutory phrase reasonably cannot be confined to any of these amounts, since it imports each and all of them. The \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 394]\n\u00a0\n 'current rate of wages' is not simple, but progressive-from so much (the minimum) to so much (the maximum), including all between; and to direct the payment of an amount which shall not be less than one of several different amounts, without saying which, is to leave the question of what is meant incapable of any definite answer. See People ex rel. Rodgers v. Coler, 166 N. Y. 1, 24-25, 59 N. E. 716, 52 L. R. A. 814, 82 Am. St. Rep. 605.\n Nor can the question be solved by resort to the established canons of construction that enable a court to look through awkward or clumsy expression, or language wanting in precision, to the intent of the Legislature. For the vice of the statute here lies in the impossibility of ascertaining, by any reasonable test, that the Legislature meant one thing rather than another, and in the futility of an attempt to apply a requirement, which assumes the existence of a rate of wages single in amount, to a rate in fact composed of a multitude of gradations. To construe the phrase 'current rate of wages' as meaning either the lowest rate or the highest rate, or any intermediate rate, or, if it were possible to determine the various factors to be considered, an average of all rates, would be as likely to defeat the purpose of the Legislature as to promote it. See State v. Partlow, 91 N. C. 550, 553, 49 Am. Rep. 652; Commonwealth v. Bank of Pennsylvania, 3 Watts & S. (Pa.) 173, 177.\n In the second place, additional obscurity is imparted to the statute by the use of the qualifying word 'locality.' Who can say, with any degree of accuracy, what areas constitute the locality where a given piece of work is being done? Two men, moving in any direction from the place of operations, would not be at all likely to agree upon the point where they had passed the boundary which separated the locality of that work from the next locality. It is said that this question is settled for us by the decision of the state Supreme Court on rehearing in State v. Tibbetts, 205 P. 776, 779. But all the court did there was to define the word 'locality' as meaning 'place,' \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 395]\n\u00a0\n 'near the place,' 'vicinity,' or 'neighborhood.' Accepting this as correct, as of course we do, the result is not to remove the obscurity, but rather to offer a choice of uncertainties. The word 'neighborhood' is quite as susceptible of variation as the word 'locality.' Both terms are elastic and, dependent upon circumstances, may be equally satisfied by areas measured by rods or by miles. See Schmidt v. Kansas City Distilling Co., 90 Mo. 284, 296, 1 S. W. 865, 2 S. W. 417, 59 Am. Rep. 16; Woods v. Cochrane and Smith, 38 Iowa, 484, 485; State ex rel. Christie v. Meek, 26 Wash. 405, 407-408, 67 P. 76; Millville Imp. Co. v. Pitman, etc., Gas Co., 75 N. J. Law, 410, 412, 67 A. 1005; Thomas v. Marshfield, 10 Pick. (Mass.) 364, 367. The case last cited held that a grant of common to the inhabitants of a certain neighborhood was void because the term 'neighborhood' was not sufficiently certain to identify the grantees. In other connections or under other conditions the term 'locality' might be definite enough, but not so in a statute such as that under review imposing criminal penalties. Certainly, the expression 'near the place' leaves much to be desired in the way of a delimitation of boundaries; for it at once provokes the inquiry, 'How near?' And this element of uncertainty cannot here be put aside as of no consequence, for, as the rate of wages may vary-as in the present case it is alleged it does vary- among different employers and according to the relative efficiency of the workmen, so it may vary in different sections. The result is that the application of the law depends, not upon a word of fixed meaning in itself, or one made definite by statutory or judicial definition, or by the context or other legitimate aid to its construction, but upon the probably varying impressions of juries as to whether given areas are or are not to be included within particular localities. The constitutional guaranty of due process cannot be allowed to rest upon a support so equivocal.\n Interlocutory decree affirmed. \n\n[269 U.S. 385, 396]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in the result, on the ground that the plaintiff was not violating the statute by any criterion available in the vicinity of Cleveland. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The commissioner's own investigation shows that wages ranged from $ 3 to $4.05 per day, and the scale of wages paid by the construction company to its laborers, 25 in number, ranged from $3.20 to $6.50 per day, all but 6 of them being paid $3.60 or more. \n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORRIGAN v.

Corrigan and Helen Curits, to enjoin the conveyance of certain real estate from one to the other of the defendants.\n The case made by the bill is this: The parties are citizens of the United States, residing in the District. The plaintiff and the defendant Corrigan are white persons, and the defendant Curtis is a person of the negro race. In 1921, thirty white persons, including the plaintiff and the defendant Corrigan, owning twenty-five parcels of land, improved by dwelling houses, situated on  Street, between 18th and New Hampshire avenue, in the City of Washington, executed an indenture, duly recorded, in which they recited that for their mutual benefit and the best interests of the neighborhood comprising these properties, they mutually covenanted and agreed that no part of these properties should ever be used or occupied by, or sold, leased or given to, any person of the negro race or blood; and that this covenant should run with the land and bind their respective heirs and assigns for twenty-one years from and after its date.\n In 1922, the defendants entered into a contract by which the defendant Corrigan, although knowing the defendant Curtis to be a person of the negro race, agreed to \n\n[271 U.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n sell her a certain lot, with dwelling house, included within the terms of the indenture, and the defendant Curtis, although knowing of the existence and terms of the indenture, agreed to purchase it. The defendant Curtis demanded that this contract of sale be carried out, and, despite the protest of other parties to the indenture, the defendant Corrigan had stated that she would convey the lot to the defendant Curtis.\n The bill alleged that this would cause irreparable injury to the plaintiff and the other parties to the indenture, and that the plaintiff, having no adequate remedy at law, was entitled to have the covenant of the defendant Corrigan specifically enforced in equity by an injunction preventing the defendants from carrying the contract of sale into effect; and prayed, in substance, that the defendant Corrigan be enjoined during twenty-one years from the date of the indenture, from conveying the lot to the defendant Curtis, and that the defendant Curtis be enjoined from taking title to the lot during such period, and from using or occupying it.\n The defendant Corrigan moved to dismiss the bill on the grounds that the 'indenture or covenant made the basis of said bill' is (1) 'void in that the same is contrary to and in violation of the Constitution of the United States,' and (2) 'is void in that the same is contrary to public policy.' And the defendant Curtis moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that it appears therein that the indenture or cevenant 'is void, in that it attempts to deprive the defendant, the said Helen Curtis, and others of property, without due process of law; abridges the privilege and immunities of citizens of the United States, including the defendant Helen Curtis, and other persons within this jurisdiction (and denies them) the equal protection of the law, and therefore, is forbidden by the Constitution of the United States, and especially by the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth \n\n[271 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n Amendments thereof, and the Laws enacted is aid and under the sanction of the said Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.'\n Both of these motions to dismiss were overruled, with leave to answer. 52 Wash.

This was affirmed, on appeal, by the Court of Appeals of the District. 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899. The defendants then prayed an appeal to this Court on the ground that such review was authorized under the provisions of section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227)-as it then stood, before the amendment made by the Jurisdictional Act of 1925-in that the case was one 'involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States' (paragraph 3), and 'in which the construction of' certain laws of the United States, namely, sections 1977, 1978, 1979 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  3925, 3931, 3932) were 'drawn in question' by them (paragraph 6). This appeal was allowed, in June, 1924\n\n\n The mere assertion that the case is one involving the construction or application of the Constitution, and in which the construction of federal laws is drawn in question, does not, however, authorize this Court to entertain the appeal; and it is our duty to decline jurisdiction if the record does not present such a constitutional or statutory question substantial in character and properly raised below. Sugarman v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 182, 184\n, 39 S. Ct. 191; Zucht v. King, \n260 \nU.S. 174, 176\n, 43 S. Ct. 24. And under well settled rules, jurisdiction is wanting if such questions are so unsubstantial as to be plainly without color of merit and frivolous. Wilson v. North Carolina, \n169 \nU.S. 586, 595\n, 18 S. Ct. 435; Delmar Jockey Club v. Missouri, \n210 \nU.S. 324, 335\n, 28 S. Ct. 732; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 305\n, 44 S. Ct. 96; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593\n, 46 S. Ct. 367, No. 200, decided April 12, 1926.\n Under the pleadings in the present case the only constitutional question involved was that arising under the \n\n[271 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n assertions in the motions to dismiss that the indenture or covenant which is the basis of the bill, is 'void' in that it is contrary to and forbidden by the Fifth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. This contention is entirely lacking in substance or color of merit. The Fifth Amendment 'is a limitation only upon the powers of the General Government,' Talton v. Mayes, \n163 \nU.S. 376, 382\n, 16 S. Ct. 986, 988 (41 L. Ed. 196), and is not directed against the action of individuals. The Thirteenth Amendment denouncing slavery and involuntary servitude, that is, a condition of enforced compulsory service of one to another does not in other matters protect the individual rights of persons of the negro race. Hodges v. United States, \n203 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 18 S., 27 S. Ct. 6. And the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment 'have reference to State action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.' Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n, 318; United States v. Harris, \n106 \nU.S. 629, 639\n, 1 S. Ct. 601. 'It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the Amendment.' Civil Rights Cases, \n109 \nU.S. 3, 11\n, 3 S. Ct. 18, 21 (27 L. Ed. 835). It is obvious that none of these amendments prohibited private individuals from entering into contracts respecting the control and disposition of their own property; and there is no color whatever for the contention that they rendered the indenture void. And plainly, the claim urged in this Court that they were to be looked to, in connection with the provisions of the Revised Statutes and the decisions of the courts, in determining the contention, earnestly pressed, that the indenture is void as being 'against public policy,' does not involve a constitutional question within the meaning of the Code provision.\n The claim that the defendants drew in question the 'construction' of sections 1977, 1978 and 1979 of the Revised Statutes, is equally unsubstantial. The only question raised as to these statutes under the pleadings was the \n\n[271 U.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n assertion in the motion interposed by the defendant Curtis, that the indenture is void in that it is forbidden by the laws enacted in aid and under the sanction of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. Assuming that this contention drew in question the 'construction' of these statutes, as distinguished from their 'application,' it is obvious, upon their face, that while they provide, inter alia, that all persons and citizens shall have equal right with white citizens to make contracts and acquire property, they, like the Constitutional Amendment under whose sanction they were enacted, do not in any manner prohibit or invalidate contracts entered into by private individuals in respect to the control and disposition of their own property. There is no color for the contention that they rendered the indenture void; nor was it claimed in this Court that they had, in and of themselves, any such effect.\n We therefore conclude that neither the constitutional nor statutory questions relied on as grounds for the appeal to this Court have any substantial quality or color of merit, or afford any jurisdictional basis for the appeal.\n And while it was further urged in this Court that the decrees of the courts below in themselves deprived the defendants of their liberty and property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, this contention likewise cannot serve as a jurisdictional basis for the appeal. Assuming that such a contention, if of a substantial character, might have constituted ground for an appeal under paragraph 3 of the Code provision, it was not raised by the petition for the appeal or by any assignment of error, either in the Court of Appeals or in this Court; and it likewise is lacking is substance. The defendants were given a full hearing in both courts; they were not denied any constitutional or statutory right; and there is no semblance of ground for any contention that the decrees were so plainly arbitrary \n\n[271 U.S. 323, 332]\n\u00a0\n and contrary to law as to be acts of mere spoliation. See Delmar Jockey Club v. Missouri, supra, 335 (28 S. Ct. 732). Mere error of a court, if any there be, in a judgment entered after a full hearing, does not constitute a denial of due process of law. Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 16 S. Ct. 80; Jones v. Buffalo Creek Coal Co., \n245 \nU.S. 328, 329\n, 38 S. Ct. 121.\n It results that, in the absence of any substantial constitutional or statutory question giving us jurisdiction of this appeal under the provisions of section 250 of the Judicial Code, we cannot determine upon the merits the contentions earnestly pressed by the defendants in this court that the indenture is not only void because contrary to public policy, but is also of such a discriminatory character that a court of equity will not lend its aid by enforcing the specific performance of the covenant. These are questions involving a consideration of rules not expressed in any constitutional or statutory provision, but claimed to be a part of the common or general law in force in the District of Columbia; and, plainly, they may not be reviewed under this appeal unless jurisdiction of the case is otherwise acquired.\n Hence, without a consideration of these questions, the appeal must be, and is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCULVER v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 816\nArgued: Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Officer in air service, while detailed by Secretary of War to General Staff War College for duty as student officer, and not under command of Chief of Air Service (Army Regulations, par. 1575), held not required to participate regularly and frequently in aerial flights, and not entitled to additional pay provided for by Army Reorganization Act June 4, 1920,  13a (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1860a(1)) prior to the President's regulation of December 31, 1920 (Army Regulations, par. 1269 1\/2).\n Messrs. George A. King, Wm. Bruce King, and George R. Shields, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff brought this action to recover increase of pay from August 15, 1921, to June 30, 1922, under the Army Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920,  13a, c. 227, 41 Stat. 759, 768 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1860a( 1)). The Court of Claims made findings of fact, held him not entitled to recover and dismissed the petition.\n That section provided that officers and enlisted men of the army should receive an increase of 50 per centum of their pay while on duty requiring them to participate regularly and frequently in aerial flights. Plaintiff was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Service, ans was rated as an airplane pilot. For some time prior to August 15, \n\n[271 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n 1921, he was assigned to duty which required him to participate regularly and frequently in aerial flights, and up to that date he received the increase of pay allowed for that service. August 9, 1921, the Secretary of War Issued a special order that plaintiff be relieved 'from his present assignment and duties' and that, on August 15, 1921, he report to the commandant, General Staff War College, for duty as a student officer. Plaintiff complied, and remained on duty as a student officer from that date to June 30, 1922. While there he performed a number of flights in each month, 131 in all.\n Paragraph 1575 of the Army Regulations charges the Chief of Air Service, under direction of the Secretary of War, with command of the Air Service, both staff and line, and with its management, including the regulation of the duties of officers and others who may be employed under his direction, excepting such persons as may be specifically detached by the order of the Secretary of War. December 2, 1920, a circular letter was issued by the Chief of Air Service to the commanding officers of all air stations. It was there stated that he considered that any officer holding a flying rating was on duty which required his participation in regular and frequent flights, no matter what the nature of that duty might be. December 31, 1921, after the controversy culminating in this suit arose, the President issued a regulation (paragraph 1269 1\/2, Army Regulations) requiring all officers of the Air Service who are rated as pilots of airplanes or airships and on a duty status to participate regularly in aerial flights as pilots whenever flying facilities are available.\n The United States concedes that, after the taking effect of that regulation, plaintiff was on a duty status requiring him to participate regularly and frequently in flights, and that he was entitled to have the increase of pay given by the Act of June 4, 1920. \n\n[271 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n It remains to be considered whether he was entitled to the increase of pay from August 15 to December 31, 1921. The findings sufficiently show that he actually took frequent and regular flights during that period; but there is no finding that he was required to do so. Paragraph 1575 of the Army Regulations expressly excepts from the command of the Chief of the Air Service such persons as may be specifically detached by order of the Secretary of War. The plaintiff was so detached by the order of August 9, 1921. It follows that the circular letter of December 2, 1920, did not apply to him while on duty as a student officer at the General Staff War College. During that time he was not subject to the orders or regulations of the Chief of the Air Service; and undoubtedly that was the reason the President made the regulation of December 31, 1921\n\n\n The facts found are not sufficient to show that plaintiff was on duty requiring him to participate in the flights which he actually took prior to that regulation. It does not appear that he would have been subject to military discipline if he had not taken the flights. In the absence of such finding he is not entitled to recover increase of pay for that period. But the regulation of December 31, 1921, did require him to take such flights, and-as conceded by the United States-he is entitled to recover such increase for the period between that date and June 30, 1922.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. WILLIFORD(1926)\nNo. 316\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles J. Kappler, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves a single question relating to the construction and effect of section 23 of the Act of April 26, 1906, \n\n[271 U.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n c. 1876,1 dealing with the Five Civilized Tribes. This reads:\n'Every person of lawful age and sound mind may by last will and testament devise and bequeath all of his estate, real and personal, and all interest therein: Provided, That no will of a full-blood Indian devising real estate shall be valid, if such last will and testament disinherits the parent, wife, spouse, or children of such full-blood Indian, unless acknowledged before and approved by a judge of the United States court of the Indian Territory, or a United States commissioner.'\n\n The subject-matter of the controversy-which arose in the course of a proceeding instituted in a local court of Oklahoma to foreclose a mortgage- is a part of a surplus allotment of 160 acres out of tribal lands made in 1904 to Frazier McLish, a full-blood Chickasaw Indian and held by him subject to restrictions against alienation. In July, 1906, he executed a will by which he bequeathed one dollar to his wife and each of his children, and devised all the residue of his property, including this allotment, to his sister. In 1907, McLish having died, the will was probated and recorded, the only endorsement which it bore being the following:\n'Approved by me July 9, 1906. Thomas N. Robnett, U. S. Commissioner for the Southern District, Indian Territory, First Commissioner's District, in accordance with the Act of Congress of April 26, 1906. ( Seal).'\n\n For present purposes it suffices to say that the proceeding in the District Court involved a controversy as to the title to part of this allotment, arising between J. A. White, to whom it had been conveyed by the devisee, and S. H. Davis, to whom White had given a mortgage, on the one side; and the widow and children of the testator, on the other side. White and Davis claimed that the will was valid and had passed title to the devisee; and the widow and children claimed that it was invalid, since it had not \n\n[271 U.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n been acknowledged before a commissioner or judge as required by the Act of 1906, and that the title to the allotment had descended to them.\n On the trial the United States Commissioner testified that at the time he approved the will the testator had appeared before him and acknowledged its execution for the purposes therein mentioned, but that, by inadvertence, the certificate of such acknowledgment had been omitted. The court, in view of this evidence, held that as the will had been in fact acknowledged before the Commissioner, it was valid and vested title to the allotment in the devisee; and gave judgment accordingly. On appeal, this was reversed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, which held that parol testimony was inadmissible to supply the lack of a certificate of acknowledgment, and that under the Act of 1906 the will was invalid. 106 Okl. 208, 232 P. 828.\n The case is now before us on a writ of error, which was allowed in March, 1925, and a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was postponed to the hearing on the merits. The writ of error must be dismissed under the Jurisdictional Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 726); and the writ of certiorari is granted.\n Davis and White do not deny that the will disinherited the testator's wife and children, Re Byford's Will, 65 Okl. 159, 162, 165 P. 194, and that it was invalid unless acknowledged before the Commissioner, as well as approved by him. Their contention is, that under a proper construction of section 23 of the Act of 1906, where a full-blood Indian who devises his lands to the exclusion of his wife and children, appears before a Commissioner and acknowledges the document presented to be his will, 'it is the fact of such acknowledgment by said testator, and not any certificate by the officer, which gives validity to the will'; and they expressly concede that 'if, on the other hand, Congress intended to require that a certificate of acknowledgment be placed on the will itself by the officer,' they cannot prevail. \n\n[271 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n Construing section 23 of the Act in the light of its manifest purpose, we think that Congress intended that to give validity to such a will it was necessary not only that it be in fact acknowledged by the testator before the officer, but that the officer place a certificate of such acknowledgment upon the will, as an essential part of the acknowledgment itself.\n Prior to the Act of 1906, Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes had no power to dispose of their restricted lands by will. Taylor v. Parker, \n235 \nU.S. 42\n, 35 S. Ct. 22; Blundell v. Wallace, \n267 \nU.S. 373, 374\n, 45 S. Ct. 247. And in giving them generally such power by section 23 of the Act, it was specifically provided that no will of a full-blood Indian devising real estate and disinheriting his parent, spouse or children, should be valid 'unless acknowledged before and approved by a judge of a United States court ... or United States Commissioner.'\n It is clear that it was intended by this proviso to prevent a full- blood Indian from being overreached and imposed upon, and induced for an inadequate consideration or by trickery, to deprive his heirs of their inheritance; and that, to this end, a will devising his land to other persons should not be valid unless acknowledged before and approved by a judicial or quasi-judicial officer of the United States. To make certain of this, the officer was not to approve the will unless the testator appeared before him in person and acknowledged its due execution, and, upon the examination of the testator, the will appeared to be of such a character and based upon wuch consideration as to warrant its approval. Plainly, it was not intended that such acknowledgment and approval should be a perfunctory matter. And as the will when probated and recorded would be a muniment of title to the land, necessarily a certificate both of the acknowledgment and the approval should appear upon it. We cannot think that Congress intended that in a matter of this solemnity and importance, involving the recorded \n\n[271 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n title to land, the effect of a will, which when probated and recorded bore no certificate of the acknowledgment or approval essential to its validity, should thereafter rest in parol, subject to all the uncertainty that would follow if its validity could be established-when the lips of the testator were closed-by parol evidence as to the fact of acknowledgment or approval. This would destroy the certainty which is essential in muniments of title appearing upon the public records. If this were possible, the subsequent establishment of the validity of the will would largely depend upon the lapse of time before it was brought into litigation, and the availability, at that time, of evidence to establish or to contradict a claim that it had in fact been acknowledged or approved; and where portions of the land had been conveyed by the devisee to different persons, the result of suits involving the validity of the will, might often depend upon the weight attached by the courts to diverse evidence in different suits, and lead to judgments establishing the validity of the will as to the purchaser of one portion of the land, and its invalidity as against another.\n Clearly, we think, Congress did not contemplate such a disastrous result, but in granting by the Act to a full-blood Indian, under its guardianship, the power to dispose of his restricted land by will, intended that a will disinheriting those to whom his land would otherwise descend, should be valid only when the facts of acknowledgment and approval should both be certified by the officer on the will, and appear upon it when probated and placed of record.\n We conclude here that the will, by reason of the lack of any certificate of acknowledgment, was not 'acknowledged before' the Commissioner within the meaning of the Act, and, being therefore invalid, did not pass title to the allotment to the devisee. The judgment is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 34 Stat. 137, 145. \n\n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIE DEUTSCHE BANK FILIALE NURNBERG v. HUMPHREY(1926)\nNo. 224\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Amos J. Peaslee, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. William Grant and William P. Hubbard, both of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to reach and apply to a debt due from the Deutsche Bank Filiale to Humphrey money seized by the Alien Property Custodian and paid into the Treasury of the United States. Humphrey, an American citizen, deposited money, payable on demand, in a German Bank in Germany, and demanded it, as the Courts have found, on or about June 12, 1915. The money was not paid, and this suit was begun on July 9, 1921, under Trading with the Enemy Act October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 a-3115 1\/2 j). The debt was a debt of German marks. The Courts below held that it should be translated into dollars at the rate of exchange existing when the demand was made. 7 F.(2d) 330. The value of the mark fell after that date and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court to determine whether the time fixed for the translation into dollars was correct. \n269 \nU.S. 547\n, 46 S. Ct. 106.\n In this case, unlike Hicks v. Guinness, \n269 \nU.S. 71\n, 46 S. Ct. 46. at the date of the demand the German Bank owed no duty \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n to the plaintiff under our law. It was not subject to our jurisdiction and the only liability that it incurred by its failure to pay was that which the German law might impose. It has incurred no additional or other one since. A suit in this country is based upon an obligation existing under the foreign law at the time when the suit is brought, and the obligation is not enlarged by the fact that the creditor happens to be able to catch his debtor here. Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451\n, 24 S. Ct. 692. See Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, \n234 \nU.S. 542\n, 34 S. Ct. 955. We may assume that when the Bank failed to pay on demand its liability was fixed at a certain number of marks both by the terms of the contract and by the German law-but we also assume that it was fixed in marks only, not at the extrinsic value that those marks then had in commodities or in the currency of another country. On the contrary, we repeat, it was and continued to be a liability in marks alone and was open to satisfaction by the payment of that number of marks, at any time, with whatever interest might have accrued, however much the mark might have fallen in value as compared with other things. See Socie te des Ho tels le Touquet Paris Plage v. Cummings, (1922) 1 K. B. 451. An obligation in terms of the currency of a country takes the risk of currency fluctuations and whether creditor or debtor profits by the change the law takes no account of it. Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 548, 549. Obviously in fact a dollar or a mark may have different values at different times but to the law that establishes it it is always the same. If the debt had been due here and the value of dollars had dropped before suit was brought the plaintiff could recover no more dollars on that account. A foreign debtor should be no worse off.\n There has been so little discussion of what we regard as the principles that ought to govern this question that \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n we refrain from citing the many cases that have touched upon it and content ourselves with stating what seems to us the proper rule, only adding a few words as to Sutherland v. Mayer (May 24, 1926) \n271 \nU.S. 272\n, 46 S. Ct. 538. That case concerned the settlement of accounts of a German partnership having one member in America, and dealt with his claim to funds in America in the hands of the Boston branch until seized by the United States. With regard to the Boston partner's lien upon that fund the partnership contract fairly might be regarded as subjecting the German partners to American law and warranting a settlement as of the date when it first became legal after the war, taking the mark at its value at that time. Hicks v. Guinness, \n269 \nU.S. 71\n, 46 S. Ct. 46. It was held that in an equitable proceeding where it was hard to lay down any logical rule substantial fairness warranted that result, referring to cases that arose after the Civil War. Here we are lending our Courts to enforce an obligation (as we should put it, to pay damages,) arising from German law alone and ought to enforce no greater obligation than exists by that law at the moment when the suit is brought.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n It is well settled, I think, that, where the cause of action for a tort or breach of contract to deliver goods accrues in a foreign country and is sued on here, the time fixing the value of foreign money in dollars is the date when the wrong was committed or the breach occurred. This court has recently applied the same rule to the case of a simple debt payable in this country, in Hicks v. Guinness, \n269 \nU.S. 71\n, 46 S. Ct. 46, and to the settlement of partnership accounts where the partnership funds were partly here and partly abroad, in Sutherland v. Mayer (May 24, 1926) \n271 \nU.S. 272\n, 46 S. Ct. 538. The majority opinion rests upon the distinction that \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n the debt upon which recovery here is sought was payable in Germany. The distinction, I think, is fallacious, and proceeds from a very narrow view of the principles applied in Hicks v. Guinness and Sutherland v. Mayer.\n It is said that when the bank failed to pay on demand, its liability was fixed by German law at a certain number of German marks, and in marks only; that it continued to be a liability in marks only and was open to satisfaction by the payment of that number of marks at any time, however much the mark might have fallen in value as compared with other things, citing Socie te des Ho tels le Touquet Paris-Plage v. Cummings, (1922) 1 K. B. 451. And that, of course, is true if the payment be made in Germany, where marks remain legal tender at all times irrespective of their fluctuating value when measured by their purchasing power or by the money of other countries. And this is all that is held in Socie te des ho tels, etc., v. Cummings, supra. See pages 458, 461, 464. It, likewise, may be assumed that if suit had been brought in Germany, a judgment at any time for the number of marks called for by the obligation would have satisfied the requirements of German law, since there marks were not only the things to be delivered but the lawful money with which to satisfy a breach of an obligation to deliver them. But if suit be brought in a court of this country, where marks are not money but things only, the judgment must be in dollars and cannot be in marks any more than it could be in wheat if the broken contract related to that commodity.\n The view that the judgment date should govern puts undue emphasis upon the character of the thing to be delivered and ignores completely the all-important element of the time when the delivery should have been made. In respect of that element, I see no good reason for making a distinction between marks and wheat. In either case, if suit be brought in Germany, the injured \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n party is entitled to recover the amount of his loss in marks and in marks only. In the one case, the subject-matter (wheat) must be translated into money; but not so in the other, for the subject-matter is money already. In the case of wheat, therefore, the date of the breach must be considered because, presumably in Germany as here, it is the value of the wheat in marks at that time which fixes the amount of recovery. In the case of marks, however, the element of time is of no consequence since, in Germany, the value of a mark can be measured only by itself.\n But in an action brought here to recover upon a failure to deliver marks in Germany, the question of time becomes material; for here a mark is not money, but a commodity; and, if plaintiff is to be compensated in dollars for his loss, we must inquire, When did the loss occur? just as we must make that inquiry in order to fix in dollars the value of wheat in a suit to recover for the nondelivery of that commodity. To me it seems clear that, in the one case as in the other, the basis of recovery must be the value in dollars of the thing lost at the time of the loss. In this respect, a simple debt payable in marks and an obligation to deliver goods in Germany stand upon the same footing. In either case, the injured party is entitled to have in the money of this country the value of what he would have obtained if the contract had been performed at the stipulated time, Lord Eldon, in Cash v. Kennion, 11 Ves. 314, 316, expressed the applicable principle when he said:\n'I cannot bring myself to doubt, that, where a man agrees to pay 100 in London upon the 1st of January, he ought to have that sum there upon that day. If he fails in that contract, wherever the creditor sues him, the law of that country ought to give him just as much as he would have had, if the contract had been performed.'\n\n The date for conversion adopted by this court after the Civil War in respect of obligations payable in \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n Confederate currency was the date, and not the maturity, of the obligation, upon the ground that such currency never had been lawful; but in a dictum by Mr. Justice Field in Effinger v. Kenney, \n115 \nU.S. 566, 575\n, 6 S. Ct. 179, 184 (29 L. Ed. 495,) it is clearly recognized that, if the foreign currency involved be lawful, the date for conversion is that of the maturity of the contract. In that case:\n'The damages recoverable for a breach of the contract are to be measured by the value of the currency at its maturity.'\n\n To take the date of judgment for determining the value is to adopt for the measurement of a loss a test resting upon the fluctuating chances of a court calendar instead of upon an event already fixed,-that is, to put aside certainty for uncertainty. The date of the breach, whether of a contract to deliver goods or to pay money, marks the essential event which gives rise to the cause of action and bears a necessary relation to the wrong sought to be redressed; while the date of the rendition of judgment bears no relation whatever to the wrong complained of and has nothing to do with the cause of action. The cases are not agreed; but an examination of them convinces me that the conclusion I have indicated by the foregoing is supported by the great weight of authority. See, for example, Page v. Levenson (D. C.) 281 F. 555, 558; Dante v. Miniggio, 54 App. D. C. 386, 298 F. 845, 33 A. L. R. 1278; Wichita Mill & E. Co. v. Naamlooze, etc., Industrie (C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 931; Hoppe v. Russo-Asiatic Bank, 235 N. Y. 37, 39, 138 N. E. 497, affirming 200 App. Div. 460, 465, 193 N. Y. S. 250; Simonoff v. Granite City Nat. Bank, 279 Ill. 248, 254, 116 N. E. 636; Grunwald v. Freese, 4 Cal. (Unrep.) 182, 34 P. 73, 76; Manners v. Pearson & Son, (1898) 1 Ch. 581, 587-588, 592-593; Socie te des Ho tels v. Cummings, ( 1921) 3 K.

Van den Hurk (1920) 2 K. B. 709, 712; In \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n re British American Continental Bank, (1922) 2 Ch. 589, 594-598.\n The case last cited was a winding-up proceeding, and the question arose over the conversion into English money of the amount of a debt payable in Belgium in Belgian currency. The court adopted as the date for conversion into English money the date when the debt was payable in Belgium, saying (page 595):\n'... This mode of computation and thus converting the one currency into the other is based upon damages for the breach of contract to deliver the commodity bargained for (i. e., the foreign currency) at the appointed time and place; consequently the date for conversion is the date of breach and not date of the judgment.'\n\n After reviewing the prior cases, including both decisions in Socie te des Ho tels v. Cummings, supra, the court concluded that:\n'The principle in no way depends either upon the nationality of the creditor or upon the fact that the place of payment is in the creditor's own country as distinguished from some other country, but applies, if at all, to every case where an action is brought in England for the recovery of a debt payable in some other currency than English money.'\n\n The same principle is announced in Lebeaupin v. Crispin, (1920) 2 K. B. 714, 723, in an action for breach of contract to deliver salmon. The court said:\n'If the damages are fixed at the date of breach where the contract is wholly to be performed in England, such also, I think, should be the result where the breach is out of England. There should not be varying rules in such a case. If the damages are once crystallized at the date of breach, then a definite date is given for the ascertainment of exchange, and the amount found payable at the hearing is awarded without regard to the fluctuations of the possible date of trial.' \n\n[272 U.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n I think it is extremely desirable that the rule established should be one capable of uniform application. To take the date of the judgment is to establish a rule which does not meet this requirement. The amount of the recovery will depend upon whether suit is promptly brought or promptly prosecuted; whether the defendant interposes dilatory measures; whether the call of the docket is largely in arrears or is up-to-date; and, perhaps, upon whether there is a successful appeal and a new trial with the consequent annulment of the old judgment and the rendition of a new one. Under these circumstances it may well happen that, in one case, where judgment is not delayed, the plaintiff will recover a substantial sum, while in a precisely similar case, where judgment is delayed until the foreign currency has greatly depreciated, the sum recovered by comparison may be altogether insignificant. See Page v. Levenson, supra, pages 558, 559; Lebeaupin v. Crispin, supra, pages 722, 723.\n\n I am of the opinion therefore that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice SANFORD concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDODGE v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 341\nArgued: October 27, 1926Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Daniel T. Hagan, of Providence, R. I., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a proceeding in the District Court of the United States for the condemnation of the motorboat Ray of Block Island. The owners appeared as claimants and moved that the libel be dismissed on the ground that the facts alleged did not warrant a condemnation. The district Court granted the motion. 7 F.(2d) 189. \n\n[272 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree. 11 F. (2d) 522. As there was a conflict of decisions between different Circuit Courts of Appeals a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n271 \nU.S. 655\n, 46 S. Ct. 489\n\n\n The libel was brought under the National Prohibition Act October 28, 1919, c. 85, title 2,  26, 41 Stat. 305, 315 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 mm). It alleged that police officers of the city of Providence, Rhode Island, discovered a man named, seemingly one of the claimants, in the act of transporting contrary to said law intoxicating liquors in the Ray of Block Island, over navigable waters of the United States; that the officers seized the liquors and the boat and arrested the man; that he subsequently was arrested by officers of the United States, was convicted of transporting intoxicating liquors in violation of said law and was fined; that the motorboat was now in custody of a federal prohibition director for the District of Rhode Island; and that by reason of the premises the motorboat was subject to condemnation and sale. The ground on which the libel was dismissed by the District Court was that the language of section 26, making it the duty of 'the Commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law' to seize the liquor and vehicle, did not extend to the police officers of the City, who had no authority from the State to take these steps. It is stated in argument and perhaps fairly might be assumed, if we thought it important, that when the vessel was handed over to the prohibition director the liquor was no longer aboard and that the man arrested was not present at the scene. See United States v. One Reo Motor Truck (D. C.) 6 F. (2d) 412. The Circuit Court of Appeals while agreeing with the above construction of section 26 held that the Government might adopt the seizure and give it retroactive effect. This is in accord with United States v. Story, 294 F. 517 (C. C. A. Fifth Circuit) but contrary to United States v. Loomis, 297 F. 359 (C. C. A. Ninth Circuit); this last decision being considerably \n\n[272 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n qualified however by the same Court in the later case of United States v. One Studebaker Seven Passenger Sedan, 4 F. (2d) 534.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the often quoted language of Mr. Justice Story in The Caledonian, 4 Wheat. 100, 4. L. Ed. 523, to the effect that anyone may seize any property for a forfeiture to the Government, and that if the Government adopts the act and proceeds to enforce the forfeiture by legal process, this is of no less validity than when the seizure is by authority originally given. The statement is repeated by the same judge in Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 359, and Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197. See also Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246, 310. The owner of the property suffers nothing that he would not have suffered if the seizure had been authorized. However effected it brings the object within the power of the Court, which is an end that the law seeks to attain, and justice to the owner is as safe in the one case as in the other. The jurisdiction of the Court was secured by the fact that the res was in possession of the prohibition director when the libel was filed. The Richmond, 9 Cranch, 102. The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391, 403. The Underwriter (C. C. A.) 13 F. (2d) 433, 434. We can see no reason for doubting the soundness of these principles when the forfeiture is dependant upon subsequent events any more than when it occurs at the time of the seizure, although it was argued that there was a difference. They seem to us to embody good sense. The exclusion of evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seizure stand on a different ground. If the search and seizure are unlawful as invading personal rights secured by the Constitution those rights would be infringed yet further if the evidence were allowed to be used. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDORCHY v. STATE OF KANSAS(1926)\nNo. 119\nArgued: October 7, 1926Decided: October 25, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 306, 307]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John F. McCarron, of Washington, D. C., and Redmond S. Brennan, of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John G. Egan, of Topeka, Kan., Chester I. Long, of Wichita, Kan., and C. B. Griffith, of Topeka, Kan., for the State of Kansas.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 17 of the Court of Industrial Relations Act, Laws of Kansas Special Session 1920, c. 29, which reserving to the individual employee the right to quit his employment at any time, makes it unlawful to conspire 'to induce others to quit their employment for the purpose and with the intent to hinder, delay, limit or suspend the operation of' mining. Section 19 makes it a felony for an officer of a labor union willfully to use the power or influence incident to his office to induce another person to violate any provision of the act. \n\n[272 U.S. 306, 308]\n\u00a0\n Dorchy was prosecuted criminally for violating section 19. The jury found him guilty through inducing a violation of section 17; the trial court sentenced him to fine and imprisonment, and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. Kansas v. Howat, 112 Kan. 235, 210 P. 352. Dorchy duly claimed in both state courts that section 19, as applied, was void because it prohibits strikes, and that to do so is a denial of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Because this claim was denied, the case is here under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended ( Comp. St.  1214).\n This is the second writ of error. When the case was first presented, it appeared that after entry of the judgment below certain provisions of the act had been held invalid by this court in Charles Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. The question suggested itself whether section 19 had not necessarily fallen, as a part of the system of so-called compulsory arbitration, so that there might be no occasion to consider the constitutional objection made specifically to it. That question being one of statutory interpretation, which had not been passed upon by the state court, the case was reversed, without costs, and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n, 44 S. Ct. 323. Thereupon the Supreme Court of Kansas decided that section 19 is so far severable from the general scheme of legislation held invalid that it may stand alone with the legal effect of an independent statute, and it reaffirmed the judgment of the trial court. Kansas v. Howat, 116 Kan. 412, 227 P. 752. By the construction thus given to the statute we are bound. The only question open upon this second writ of error is whether the statute as so construed and applied is constitutional.\n The state court did not, in either of its opinions, mention the specific objection to the validity of section 19 now \n\n[272 U.S. 306, 309]\n\u00a0\n urged. In the second, it discussed only the question of statutory construction. In the first, it stated merely that the case is controlled by State v. Howat, 109 Kan. 376, 198 P. 686, 25 A. L. R. 1210. Court of Industrial Relations v. Charles Wolff Packing Co., 109 Kan. 629, 201 P. 418, and State v. Howat, 109 Kan. 779, 202 P. 72. In these cases, which came to this court for review in Howat v. Kansas, \n258 \nU.S. 181\n, 42 S. Ct. 277, and Charles Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280; Id., \n267 \nU.S. 552\n, 45 S. Ct. 441, there was no occasion to consider the precise claim now urged-the invalidity of section 19 when treated as an independent statute. Nor was this question referred to, in any way. But the claims made by Dorchy below properly raised it, and, as the judgment entered involves a denial of the claim, we must pass upon it. The question requiring decision is not, however, the broad one whether the Legislature has power to prohibit strikes. It is whether the prohibition of section 19 is unconstitutional as here applied. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S. Ct. 106. The special facts out of which the strike arose must therefore be considered.\n Some years prior to February 3, 1921, the George H. Mackie Fuel Company had operated a coal mine in Kansas. Its employees were members of District No. 14, United Mine Workers of America. On that day, Howat, as president, and Dorchy, as vice president, of the union, purporting to act under direction of its executive board, called a strike. So far as appears, there was no trade dispute. There had been no controversy between the company and the union over wages, hours, or conditions of labor; over discipline or the discharge of an employee; concerning the observance of rules; or over the employment of nonunion labor. Nor was the strike ordered as a sympathetic one in aid of others engaged in any such controversy. The order was made and the strike was called to compel the company to pay a claim of one Mishmash for $180. The men were told this; and they \n\n[272 U.S. 306, 310]\n\u00a0\n were instructed not to return to work until they should be duly advised that the claim had been paid. The strike order asserted that the claim had 'been settled by the joint board of miners and operators but (that) the company refuses ... to pay Brother Mishmash any part of the money that is due him.' There was, however, no evidence that the claim had been submitted to arbitration, nor of any contract requiring that it should be. The claim was disputed. It had been pending nearly two years. So far as appears, Mishmash was not in the company's employ at the time of the strike order. The men went out in obedience to the strike order, and they did not return to work until after the claim was paid, pursuant to an order of the Court of Industrial Relations. While the men were out on strike, this criminal proceeding was begun.\n Besides these facts, which appear by the bill of exceptions, the State presents for our consideration further facts which appear by the record in Kansas v. Howat, 109 Kan. 376, 198 P. 686, 25 A. L. R. 1210; Id., \n258 \nU.S. 181\n, 42 S. Ct. 277, one of the cases referred to by the Supreme Court of Kansas in its first opinion in the case at bar. These show that Dorchy called this strike in violation of an injunction issued by the state court, and that the particular controversy with Mishmash arose in this way. Under the contract between the company and the union, the rate of pay for employees under 19 was $3.65 a day and for those over 19 the rate was $5. Mishmash had been paid at the lower rate from August 31, 1917, to March 22, 1918, without protest. On that day he first demanded pay at the higher rate, and claimed back pay from August 31, 1917, at the higher rate. His contention was that he had been born August 31, 1898. The company paid him, currently, at the higher rate beginning April 1, 1918. It refused him the back pay, on the ground that he was in fact less than nineteen years old. One entry in the Mishmash family Bible gave \n\n[272 U.S. 306, 311]\n\u00a0\n August 31, 1898, as the date of his birth; another August 31, 1899. Hence the dispute. These additional facts were not put in evidence in the case at bar. Kansas v. Howat, 109 Kan. 376, 198 P. 686, 25 A. L. R. 1210, was a wholly independent proceeding. Mere reference to it by the court as a controlling decision did not incorporate its record into that of the case at bar. See Pacific R. Co. v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., \n111 \nU.S. 505, 517\n, 518 S., 4 S. Ct. 583. And it does not appear that the court treated these facts as matters of which it took judicial notice. We must dispose of the case upon the facts set forth in the bill of exceptions.\n The right to carry on business-be it called liberty or property-has value. To interfere with this right without just cause is unlawful. The fact that the injury was inflicted by a strike is sometimes a justification. But a strike may be illegal because of its purpose, however orderly the manner in which it is conducted. To collect a stale claim due to a fellow member of the union who was formerly employed in the business is not a permissible purpose. In the absence of a valid agreement to the contrary, each party to a disputed claim may insist that it be determined only by a court. Compare Guaranty Trust Co. v. Green Cove R. R., \n139 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 11 S. Ct. 512; Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109\n, 44 S. Ct. 274. To enforce payment by a strike is clearly coercion. The Legislature may make such action punishable criminally, as extortion or otherwise. Compare People v. Barondess, 16 N. Y. S. 436, 61 Hun. 571; Id., 133 N. Y. 649, 31 N. E. 240. 1 And it may subject to punishment him who uses the power or influence incident to his office in a union to order the strike. Neither the common law, nor the Fourteenth Amendment, confers the absolute right to strike. Compare Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194, 204\n, 205 S., 25 S. Ct. 3.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reported in full in the North Eastern Reporter; not reported in full in New York Reports. \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUFFY v.

C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, and John O. H. Pitney, of Newark, N. J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises under the Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 302-306, imposing upon every corporation, \n\n[272 U.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n partnership and individual a war excess profits tax. The pertinent provisions of the act are as follows:\n'Sec. 201. That in addition to the taxes under existing law and under this act there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid for each taxable year upon the income of every corporation, partnership, or individual, a tax (hereinafter in this title referred to as the tax) equal to the following percentages of the net income:\n\n'Twenty per centum of the amount of the net income in excess of the deduction (determined as hereinafter provided) and not in excess of fifteen per centum of the invested capital for the taxable year. ...\n\n'Sec. 203.

That as used in this title, the term 'invested capital' for any year means the average invested capital for the year, as defined and limited in this title, averaged monthly.\n\n'As used in this title 'invested capital' does not include stocks, bonds (other than obligations of the United States), or other assets, the income from which is not subject to the tax imposed by this title nor money or other property borrowed, and means, subject to the above limitations:\n\n'(a) In the case of a corporation or partnership: (1) Actual cash paid in, (2) the actual cash value of tangible \n\n[272 U.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n property paid in other than cash, for stock or shares in such corporation or partnership, at the time of such payment (but in case such tangible property was paid in prior to January first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, the actual cash value of such property as of January first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, but in no case to exceed the par value of the original stock or shares specifically issued therefor), and (3) paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits used or employed in the business, exclusive of undivided profits earned furing the taxable year. ...' Comp. St.  6336 3\/8 b, 6336 3\/8 d, 6336 3\/8 h.\n\n By section 200 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/8 a) it is provided that the term 'corporation' includes joint-stock companies or associations and insurance companies and we assume that this includes nonstock mutual insurance companies as well as those having capital stock\n Respondent is a mutual company having no capital stock; and its policyholders constitute its members. Its business has always been conducted upon the 'level premium plan,' under which the estimated annual cost of the insurance is averaged and the maximum annual contribution of each member is uniform throughout the life of the policy. The annual contributions during the early years of the policy are in excess of the natural premiums, and such excess premiums, augmented by interest thereon, are held as a reserve to maintain the insurance in the later years. These contributions (or premiums), together with the increment derived from their investment, constitute the sole assets of the company. A more complete statement of the plan will be found in the opinion of the District Court in this case, 295 F. 881, and cases cited in that opinion at page 883.\n The company is required by state laws, as a condition of continuing business, to maintain its assets at a sum not less than the amount of the 'legal reserve' required by such laws. For the year 1917 the legal reserve amounted \n\n[272 U.S. 613, 617]\n\u00a0\n to something over $186,000,000. In addition to the legal reserve, the company maintained a second or 'contingent reserve' as a margin of safety to meet contingencies. The two reserves are not segregated in any way or separately identified or invested. The funds therein, constituting the company's entire assets, are invested in its office building and in government bonds and other securities. The income resulting from the investments is returned for federal taxation and is taxed. For the year 1917 the sum of the two reserves was returned by the company as invested capital for that taxable year. The net income shown for the year was $1, 808,339.33, upon which the company paid an income tax of $108,500.36, but no excess profits tax. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue amended the returns and, thereupon, levied an additional assessment against the company amounting to $83,779.70. This was accomplished, so far as necessary to be now considered, by deducting from the amount of invested capital as returned the sum of $186,258,796, being the exact amount of the legal reserve, and reducing the company's invested capital for the year to the sum of $14,719,043.76. It is agreed that if, instead of this latter sum, the company's invested capital had been computed at any sum in excess of $25,500,000, no war excess profits tax would have been due.\n The company apid the amount of the additional assessment under protest and brought this action to recover it. The collector moved to stike out the complaint as insufficient in law. It was stipulated that the decision on the motion should be a final disposition of the controversy. The district court denied the motion and rendered judgment for the full amount with interest. 295 F. 881. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 3 F.(2d) 1020\n\n\n The question for determination is whether the funds constituting the legal reserve, or sufficient thereof to make \n\n[272 U.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n up as much as $25,500,000 when added to the amount allowed by the commissioner, is invested capital within the meaning of section 207(a) of the Revenue Act. The contention of the collector is that under subdivisions (1) and (2), section 207(a), invested capital must be either cash or tangible property paid in for stock or shares of the corporation, and inasmuch as the company has no capital represented by stock or shares, its legal reserve is not invested capital within the meaning of those subdivisions; that the legal reserve is not surplus or undivided profits within the meaning of subdivision (3), because it is no more than the equivalent of the obligations of the company at the time under its policies of insurance. It is contented that the legal reserve represents a present existing liability; and stress is put upon the fact that it is carried by the company on the liability side of its ledger.\n It appears from the complaint that the company has been in business since the year 1845. During that time the amount of its assets has increased, year by year, from about $20,000 in 1846 to over $200,000,000 in 1917, divided between the legal reserve and the contingent reserve, as already stated. The legal reserve includes $70,000,000 premiums theretofore paid and $116,000,000 earnings upon investments. The legal reserve, therefore, constitutes assets of a very permanent character. Originally consisting of the contributions of members only, the earnings now make up considerably more than one-half of the whole. The contributions were made for, and have been used to serve, the double purpose of protection and of investment. These assets, thus constituted, have never represented indebtedness any more than the capital of a stock corporation subscribed by its stockholders represents indebtedness. Until the maturity of a policy, the policyholder is simply a member of the corporation, with no present enforceable right against the assets. Upon the \n\n[272 U.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n maturity of the policy he becomes a creditor with an enforceable right. Then for the first time there is an indebtedness. See Mayer v. Attorney General, 31 N. J. Eq. 815, 820-822. In the meantime, each member bears a relation to the mutual company analogous to that which a stockholder bears to the jointstock company in which he holds stock. In either case, the title to the assets is in the corporation and not in the members or stockholders.\n True, the amount of the reserve is carried on the books as a liability, but only as the capital stock of a stock corporation is carried on its books as a liability. In both instances, in is a form of bookkeeping to balance assets, which in the one case is contributed by the members, and in the other by the stockholders. If section 207(a) subdivisions (1) and (2) had defined invested capital as 'actual cash paid in,' without more, it probably would not be doubted that the part of the legal reserve derived from premiums would be included. The doubt results from the use of the additional words 'for stock or shares in such corporation or partnership.' The collector says these words qualify the phrase '(1) actual cash paid in' as well as the phrase which they immediately follow, '(2) the actual cash value of tangible property paid in.' For present purposes we shall assume this to be so-although there is a plausible argument on the other side to the contrary-and consider the case accordingly. The mutual company is not a stock company, and the word 'stock' may be put aside as having no application to it. It is clear that since the word 'stock' does not describe interests in partnerships, included expressly along with corporations in the same paragraph, the word 'shares' must be held to do so. And if that word is broad enough to include partnership interests, it it broad enough to include the interests held by members in non-stock corporations. \n\n[272 U.S. 613, 620]\n\u00a0\n To hold the contrary would be to so limit the application of subdivisions (1) and (2) of section 207 (a) as altogether to exclude therefrom those corporations which have no capital stock. We cannot suppose that Congress intended such a result; but must conclude that it used the word 'stock' as appropriate in the case of stock corporations and the word 'shares' as appropriate in the case of partnerships and non-stock corporations. Such an interpretation does no violence to the ordinary meaning of the word, for while it is entirely proper to speak of 'stock' as 'shares' it is equally proper to designate the several interests in a common fund as 'shares.' To the extent of $70,000,000 the legal reserve consisted of 'actual cash paid in' by the members. These payments were intended for investment, and were invested, to increase the resources of the company and thereby reduce the cost of the insurance; and it requires no stretch of the realities to say that, within the meaning of subdivisions (1) and (2), section 207 (a), the fund which they created is invested capital. This is enough to relieve the company from the payment of any war excess profits tax, and it is unnecessary to inquire whether the remaining $116,000,000 is to be regarded as earned surplus under subdivision (3).\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDYSART v.

Hutchins, both of El Paso, Tex., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., O. R. Luhring, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Harry S. Ridgely, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals-4 F.(2d) 765-affirmed a judgment of conviction under an indictment which charged that petitioner deposited in the post office at El Paso, Tex., for conveyance through the mails, an obscene, lewd, and lascivious printed card and letter, in violation of section 211, Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10381). There were 11 counts, identical in all respects, except that each named a different addressee, generally an unmarried woman.\n Copies of the card and letter were set out in haec verba. They were intended to advertise the Queen Ann Private Home for unmarried women during pregnancy and confinement, who prefer to be away from home during such time in order 'to preserve individual character or family reputation.' The letter, ostensibly intended for a doctor, states:\n The home is a private place for the care and protection of a few unfortunate women 'until the time when they may return to their homes and friends, free from the burden of their mistake, to become useful members of society.' 'We find homes for infants by adoption when desired, or provide board for them at reasonable rates.'\n Only persons recommended by reputable physicians are accepted; and it invites visits by physicians. \n\n[272 U.S. 655, 657]\n\u00a0\n Section 211, Criminal Code, was taken from section 3893, Revised Statutes. The pertinent portions follow:\n'Every obscene, lewd, or lascivious, and every filthy book, pamphlet, picture, paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character, ... is hereby declared to be nonmailable matter . ... Whoever shall knowingly deposit, or cause to be deposited for mailing or delivery, anything declared by this section to be nonmailable, ... shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'\n\n The Solicitor General, with his usual commendable candor, after calling attention to the facts disclosed by the record and relevant opinions, adds:\n'It is not so easy to believe that circulars of this kind could to any substantial degree undermine morals or induce delinquency. To some such a result would seem altogether fanciful.'\n\n In Swearingen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 446, 450\n, 16 S. Ct. 562, 563 (40 L. Ed. 765), where the indictment charged that the plaintiff in error mailed a newspaper containing an 'obscene, lewd, and lascivious article,' contrary to section 3893, Revised Statutes, this court said:\n'The offense aimed at, in that portion of the statute we are now considering, was the use of the mails to circulate or deliver matter to corrupt the morals of the people. The words 'obscene,' 'lewd' and 'lascivious,' as used in the statute, signify that form of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity, and have the same meaning as is given them at common law in prosecutions for obscene libel. As the statute is highly penal, it should not be held to embrace language unless it is fairly within its letter and spirit. Referring to this newspaper article, as found in the record, it is undeniable that its language is exceedingly coarse and vulgar, and, as applied to an individual person, plainly libelous. But we cannot perceive in it anything of a lewd, lascivious and obscene tendency, calculated to corrupt and debauch \n\n[272 U.S. 655, 658]\n\u00a0\n the mind and morals of those into whose hands it might fall.'\n\n Notwithstanding the inexcusable action of petitioner in sending these advertisements to refined women, it is not possible for us to conclude that the indictment charges an offense within the meaning of the statute as construed by the opinion just cited. The motion to quash should have been sustained by the trial court.\n The judgment below must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, Western District of Texas, for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEARLY & DANIEL CO. v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 299\nArgued: April 30, 1926Decided: May 3, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Benton S. Oppenheimer, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit against the United States for $22,000, balance due for hay delivered. Appellant made a contract with the government the 31st of July, 1917, by which it agreed to furnish, during the period beginning August 1, 1917, and ending September 30, 1917, such hay as might be required by the government during July and the first half of August of 1917, not to exceed 6,000,000 pounds, at 97 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds, and such hay as might be required during the last half of August and all of September, 1917, not exceeding 6,000,000 pounds, at 95 cents per 100 pounds, to be delivered f. o. b. cars at Newport News, Va., subject to call of the government in lots not to exceed 1,000,000 pounds per lot. The \n\n[271 U.S. 140, 141]\n\u00a0\n government made calls which the plaintiff filled as follows:\n Call No. 1, 500,000 pounds, August 15, 1917\n\n\n Call No. 2, 1,050,000 pounds, August 20, 1917.\n Call No. 3, 2,000,000 pounds, September 5, 1917.\n Call No. 4, 4,450,000 pounds, September 12, 1917.\n These calls were all filled without protest, though the later calls were for amounts greater than 1,000,000 pounds. When the final and fifth call was made for 4,000,000 pounds, the appellant objected that the call was for more pounds of hay than the contract allowed for any one call. That objection was not made until it was too late for the defendant to amend the call. The appellant's vice president then wrote to the government officer in charge that the fifth call was not deemed by the plaintiff to be in accord with the contract, and that the plaintiff did not intend to fill it. Under the terms of the contract, appellant had until November 15th, being three months from the date of the first call, to complete its deliveries. On November 19th, the camp quartermaster wired to the appellant,\n'Amount hay on hand will supply needs to December 4th. Require prompt delivery 4,000,000 pounds. Advise at once your action, otherwise must buy in open market.'\n\n After further exchange of telegrams, plaintiff sent the following telegram to the camp quartermaster under date of November 21, 1917:\n'We will start shipping hay immediately, and in case you need any before arrival will arrange to have Hiden loan us a supply. Want it distinctly understood that we are doing this under protest and are going to put the matter up to proper authorities in Washington; and if they rule in our favor, want settlement at fair market price for amount we overfill. Will you wire C. S. Ruttle, General Agent, D. B. C. & W. Railway, to furnish equipment immediately as we request for hay to ship to you? Answer.' \n\n[271 U.S. 140, 142]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff delivered under protest the remaining 4,000,000 pounds of hay, Thereafter the plaintiff accepted without protest the sum of $38, 000 which was all that was due under the contract. The plaintiff then filed this claim for $22,000 with the Acting Quartermaster General of the United States Army, with the Auditor for the War Department, with the Secretary of War, with the Comptroller of the Treasury, and with the Board of Contract Adjustment, all of whom in turn decided that the claim could not be paid.\n\n The appellant had the option of delivering the remainder of the hay under the terms of the contract, or of not delivering it at all, if the contract had been broken. It chose to deliver. It made a protest but that was ignored by the officers of the government, and when the government tendered the contract price, it was accepted by the appellant and without protest. Under such circumstances there is no ground for implying a contract to pay more than the contract price. New York, New Haven & H. R. Co. c. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 40 S.

CHILE COPPER CO.(1926)\nNo. 375\nArgued: Decided: March 22, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 452, 453]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arthur A. Ballantine, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of taxes alleged to have been erroneously collected for the years 1917 to 1920. The taxes were levied under the Acts of September 8, 1916, c. 463, s 407, 39 Stat. 756, 789 ( Comp. St. s 5980a) and of February 24, 1919, c. 18, s 1000, (a)(1) and (c), 40 Stat. 1057, 1126 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 5980n). Both statutes impose upon domestic corporations organized for profit a tax 'with respect to the carrying on or doing business,' at certain rates for the fair value of the capital stock, and both exempt such corporations 'not engaged in business' during the preceding taxable year. The question is whether the plaintiff, the Chile Copper Company, brings itself within this exemption. The facts are set forth in the complaint and the case was heard upon a motion to dismiss. In the District Court judgment was given for the plaintiff Chile Copper Co. v. Edwards, 294 F. 581. The judgment was affirmed on the opinion below by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 F.(2d) 1014. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 45 S. Ct. 637, \n268 U.S. 685\n\u00a0\n\n\n The facts are somewhat peculiar. The Chile Exploration Company, a New Jersey corporation, owned mines in Chile and needed to borrow large sums of money in order to develop them. By the laws of Chile it could not mortgage its mines effectively and therefore could not \n\n[270 U.S. 452, 454]\n\u00a0\n give security directly for bonds. To meet the difficulty the Chile Copper Company was organized in Delaware for the purpose of holding the capital stock of the Chile Exploration Company, issuing bonds secured by a pledge of the stock, and furnishing the proceeds from time to time to the Exploration Company to enable the latter to go on with its work. The purpose was carried out. On April 1, 1917, the plaintiff authorized the issue of collateral trust bonds for $100,000,000 to be secured by a pledge of all the above-mentioned stock. During the six months ending on June 30, 1917, it executed an agreement with underwriters and issued $35,000,000 of the bonds, received payments from subscribers, which were deposited in a special account with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, paid the expenses of the issue from the special account and made provision for the accrued interest payable upon the bonds. It also paid the interest on $15, 000,000 of bonds outstanding under an earlier pledge. During the same time stockholders' and directors' meetings were held, directors and officers were chosen, corporate books and accounting records were kept, and such other acts were done and expenses paid as were necessary to keep up the corporate existence. An office was maintained for the activities described. The plaintiff owned and voted on the stock of the Exploration Company, and elected its directors, and made advances to it from the proceeds of the bonds issued in 1917, the Guaranty Trust Company being directed after payment of certain matters not to pay checks drawn upon the special account unless accompanied by a letter from the plaintiff stating that the proceeds would be used for specified purposes connected with the development of the mines. The plaintiff agreed to furnish and did furnish the Guaranty Company statements showing that the proceeds had been so applied. During the six months mentioned the sum of $1,250,000 was advanced to the Exploration Company, and \n\n[270 U.S. 452, 455]\n\u00a0\n interest upon loans and a part of the bond discount paid by it to the plaintiff and payments on account of a dividend also were made.\n The activities for succeeding years were similar, advances to the Exploration Company being made each year. The plaintiff had funds received from the issue of bonds in 1917, in excess of the amounts that it thought proper to advance during the given period to the Exploration Company. A part of these it invested in Liberty Bonds, but the greater part, which it had deposited with the Guaranty Trust Company and the Central Union Trust Company, it authorized those companies to lend on call in the plaintiff's name and at its risk, taking security. If the security was not satisfactory the plaintiff directed the Trust Company to call the loan. During the year ending June 30, 1920, 224 loans amounting to $37,200,000 were made and 180 loans amounting to $29,100,000 were called. In the same year the plaintiff received $332,366.90 as interest upon these loans. During the previous year it received $194,579.20 upon similar loans.\n If the corporation was one that Congress had power to tax in this way, it is hard to say that it is not within the taxing acts. It was organized for profit and was doing what it principally was organized to do in order to realize profit. The cases must be exceptional, when such activities of such corporations do not amount to doing business in the sense of the statutes. The exemption 'when not engaged in business' ordinarily would seem pretty nearly equivalent to when not pursuing the ends for which the corporation was organized, in the cases where the end is profit. In our opinion the plaintiff was liable to the tax. We do not rest our conclusion upon the issue of bonds in the first year or the call loans made in the last, and for the same reasons we cannot let the fagot be destroyed by taking up each item of conduct separately and breaking the stick. The activities and situation must \n\n[270 U.S. 452, 456]\n\u00a0\n be judged as a whole. Looking at them as a whole we see that the plaintiff was a good deal more than a mere conduit for the Chile Exploration Company. It was its brain or at least the efferent nerve without which that company could not move. The plaintiff owned and by indirection governed it, and was its continuing support, by advances from time to time in the plaintiff's discretion. There was some suggestion that there was only one business and therefore ought to be only one tax. But if the one business could not be carried on without two corporations taking part in it, each must pay, by the plain words of the Act. The case is not governed by McCoach v. Minehill & Schuylkill Haven R. Co., 33 S. Ct. 419, \n228 U.S. 295\n, and United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Co., 35 S. Ct. 499, \n237 U.S. 28\n. It is nearer to Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., 37 S. Ct. 201, \n242 U.S. 503\n.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nENGEL v. DAVENPORT(1926)\nNo. 189\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. H. W. Hutton, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edward J. McCutchen, Farnham P. Griffiths, McCutchen, Olney, Mannon & Greene, all of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents. \n\n[271 U.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions involved in this case relate to the effect of section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 988, c. 250 (Comp-St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8337a) which amended section 20 of the Seamen's Act of 1915, 38 Stat. 1164, c. 153, to read as follows:\n'That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'\n\n Engel, the petitioner, brought this action at law, in January, 1923, in a Superior Court of California, against the respondent Davenport, one of the owners of a vessel on which he had been employed as a seaman,1 to recover damages for personal injuries suffered, in April, 1921, while he was engaged in placing a chain lashing around part of a cargo of lumber that had been taken on board the vessel at a port of landing. The complaint alleged, in substance, that the vessel had been negligently sent upon her voyage when unseaworthy and equipped with \n\n[271 U.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n defective appliances, in that a pelican hook, which was a necessary part of the chain lashing used in carrying the cargo, had in it a flaw observable upon ordinary inspection; that this hook was not inspected; and that it broke by reason of this flaw, causing the injuries in question. Davenport demurred to the complaint, on the ground, inter alia, that the cause of action was barred by section 340, subd. 3, of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which required an action for personal injury caused by wrongful act or negligence to be commenced within one year. This demurrer was sustained, without leave to amend; and judgment was entered in favor of Davenport, which was affirmed, on appeal, by the Supreme Court of the State. 228 P. 710, 194 Cal. 344. This writ of certiorari was then granted. 45 S. Ct. 195, \n266 U.S. 600\n.\n The petitioner contends that the suit is one founded on section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, of which the State courts have jurisdiction concurrently with the Federal courts; and that, by virtue of section 6 of the Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, c. 149 (Comp. St.  8662), incorporated in the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, it might be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued, irrespective of the State statute.\n The respondent contends, on the other hand, that the suit is not founded on the Merchant Marine Act and its provisions therefore have no application; and that, in any event, section 6 of the Employers' Liability Act is not incorporated in the Merchant Marine Act and does not determine the period of time within which an action may be commenced in a state court.\n It is settled by the decision in Panama Railroad v. Johnson, 44 S. Ct. 391, \n264 U.S. 375\n, that section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act is an exercise of the power of Congress to alter or supplement the maritime law by changes that are country-wide and uniform in operation; that it brings into the maritime law new rules drawn from the Employers' \n\n[271 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n Liability Act and its amendments-adopted by the generic reference to 'all statutes of the United States Modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal injuries to railway employees'-and 'extends to injured seamen a right to invoke, at their election, either the relief accorded by the old rules or that provided by the new rules'; that is, that it grants them, as an alternative, the common law remedy of an action 'to recover compensatory damages under the new rules as distinguished from the allowances covered by the old rules,' which, as a modification of the maritime law, may be enforced through appropriate proceedings in personam on the common law side of the courts.\n\n 1. \nThe present suit is not brought merely to enforce the liability of the owner of the vessel to indemnity for injuries caused by a defective appliance, without regard to negligence, for which an action of law could have been maintained prior to the Merchant Marine Act, Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, 42 S. Ct. 475, \n259 U.S. 255\n; and we need not determine whether if it had been thus brought under the old rules, the state statute of limitations would have been applicable. See Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 42 S. Ct. 89, \n257 U.S. 233\n. Here the complaint contains an affirmative averment of negligence in respect to the appliance. And, having been brought after the passage of the Merchant Marine Act, we think the suit is to be regarded as one founded on that Act, in which the petitioner, instead of invoking, as he might, the relief accorded him by the old maritime rules, has elected to seek that provided by the new rules in an action at law based upon negligence-in which he not only assumes the burden of proving negligence, but also, under section 3 of the Employers' Liability Act, subjects himself to a reduction of the damages in proportion to any contributory negligence on his part. This conclusion is in harmony with the Panama Railroad Case, 44 S. Ct. 391, \n264 U.S. 382\n, 383,2 in which the complaint charged that the \n\n[271 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n injuries resulted from negligence in providing a defective appliance and in other respects; and it is not in conflict with the Carlisle Packing Co. Case, in which, as shown by the original record, the suit was commenced in 1918, prior to the Merchant Marine Act. And see Lorang v. Steamship Co. (D. C.) 298 F. 547, and Lynott v. Transit Corporation, 195 N. Y. S. 13, 202 App. Div. 613.\n\n 2. \nIt is clear that the State courts have jurisdiction concurrently with the Federal courts, to enforce the right of action established by the Merchant Marine Act as a part of the maritime law. This was assumed in Re East River Co., 45 S. Ct. 114, \n266 U.S. 355\n, 368, and expressly held in Lynott v. Transit Corporation, supra, affirmed, without opinion, in 138 N. E. 473, 234 N. Y. 626. And it has been implied in various decisions in the District Courts involving the question of the right to remove to a Federal court a suit that had been commenced in a State court.\n By a provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789, now embodied in section 24, subd. 3, and section 256, subd. 3, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991, 1233), giving District Courts original jurisdiction of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, there is saved to suitors in all cases the right of a common law remedy where the common law is competent to give it. In Chelentis v. Steamship Co., 38 S. Ct. 501, \n247 U.S. 372\n, 384, where the suit had been commenced in a State court and removed to the Federal court, it was said that, under this saving clause, 'a right sanctioned by the maritime law may be enforced through any appropriate proceeding recognized at common law.' And the jurisdiction of the State courts to enforce the new common law right made a part of the maritime law, is necessarily affirmed by the provision contained in section 6 of the Employers' Liability Act3-plainly, we think, incorporated in the Merchant Marine Act by the generic reference-that jurisdiction of the Federal courts under the Act shall be concurrent with that of the courts \n\n[271 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n of the several States, and no case arising thereunder when brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any Federal court. Nor is the jurisdiction in suits under section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act limited to the Federal courts-as has been sometimes held in the District Courts-by its provision that jurisdiction 'shall be under the court of the district' in which the employer resides or his principal office is located. This, as was held in the Panama Railroad Case, 44 S. Ct. 391, \n264 U.S. 385\n,2 was not intended to affect the general jurisdiction of the Federal courts, but only to prescribe the venue of actions brought in them under the Act.\n\n 3. \nThis brings us to the question whether a suit brought in a State court to enforce the right of action granted by the Merchant Marine Act may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrues, or whether a State statute fixing a shorter period of limitation will apply. Section 6 of the Employers' Liability Act provides that 'no action shall be maintained under this Act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued.' This provision is one of substantive right, setting a limit to the existence of the obligation which the Act creates. Atlantic Coast Line v. Burnette, 36 S. Ct. 75, \n239 U.S. 199\n, 201. And it necessarily implies that the action may be maintained, as a substantive right, if commenced within the two years.\n The adoption of an earlier statute by reference makes it as much a part of the later act as though it had been incorporated at full length. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 625; In re Heath, 12 S. Ct. 615, \n144 U.S. 92\n, 94; Interstate Railway v. Massachusetts, 28 S. Ct. 26, \n207 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 12 S. Ann. Cas. 555. It brings into the later act 'all that is fairly covered by the reference,' Panama Railroad Case, 44 S. Ct. 391, \n264 U.S. 3922\n; that is to say, all the provisions of the former act which, from the nature of the subject-matter, are applicable to the later act. It is clear that the provision of the Employers' Liability \n\n[271 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n Act as to the time within which a suit may be instituted, is directly applicable to the subject-matter of the Merchant Marine Act and covered by the reference. In the Panama Railroad Case, 44 S. Ct. 391, \n264 U.S. 392\n,2 it was held that the contention that the Merchant Marine Act did not possess the uniformity in operation essential to its validity as a modification of the maritime law was unfounded, since the Employers' Liability Act which it adopted, had a uniform operation, which could not be deflected from 'by local statutes or local views of common law rules.' The period of time within which an action may be commenced is a material element in such uniformity of operation. And, plainly, Congress in incorporating the provisions of the Employers' Liability Act into the Merchant Marine Act did not intend to exclude a provision so material, and to permit the uniform operation of the Merchant Marine Act to be destroyed by the varying provisions of the State statutes of limitation.\n We conclude that the provision of section 6 of the Employers' Liability Act relating to the time of commencing the action, is a material provision of the statutes 'modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal injuries to railway employees' which was adopted by and incorporated in the Merchant Marine Act. And, as a provision affecting the substantive right created by Congress in the exercise of its paramount authority in reference to the maritime law, it must control in an action brought in a State court under the Merchant Marine Act, regardless of any statute of limitations of the State. See Arnson v. Murphy, 3 S.

CHERO COLA BOTTLING CO.(1926)\nNo. 127\nArgued: January 13, 1926Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Chauncey I. Clark, of New York City, and John D. Welman, of Evansville Ind., for appellant.\n Messrs. James T. Cutler, Paul H. Schmidt, and Isidor Kahn, all of Evansville, Ind., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant owned a wharfboat in the Ohio river at Evansville, Ind. May 14, 1922, it sank, causing dam- \n\n[271 U.S. 19, 20]\n\u00a0\n age to appellee's merchandise thereon. Appellant filed a petition in admiralty for limitation of liability. Appellees answered, and after a trial, at which much evidence as to the character of the structure was given, the District Court found that it was not a vessel within the meaning of the statutes sought to be invoked, held that the court was without jurisdiction, and dismissed the cause. The appeal is under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), and the question of jurisdiction alone is certified.\n Section 4283, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  8021), provides:\n'The liability of the owner of any vessel, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction, by any person, of any property, goods, or merchandise, shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss, damage, or injury by collision, or for any act, matter, or thing, lost (loss), damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity, or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall in no case exceed the amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending.'\n\n Section 3, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  3), provides:\n'The word 'vessel' includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.'\n\n The Act of June 19, 1886, c. 421,  4, 24 Stat. 79, 80 (Comp. St.  8027), makes the provisions relating to limitation of liability apply to 'all vessels used on lakes or rivers or in inland navigation, including canal boats, barges, and lighters.'\n Appellant was engaged in operating steamboats between Evansville and places on the Green river in Kentucky. The wharfboat in question was built in 1884 and was used at Hopefield, Ark., on the Mississippi river. In 1901 it was towed to Madison, Ind., where it was overhauled, and then to Louisville, Ky., where it was used. In 1910, after more repairs at Madison, it was taken to Evansville. Appellant acquired it in 1915. Each winter it was towed to Green river harbor to protect it \n\n[271 U.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n from ice. While in use at Evansville it was secured to the shore by four or five cables, and remained at the same point, except when moved to conform to the stage of the river. The lower part of the structure was rectangular, 243 feet long, 48 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. It was built of wood, and, to strengthen it and keep the water out, was lined around the sides and ends, extending 18 or 20 inches from the bottom, with concrete eight inches thick. It had no machinery or power for propulsion, and was not subject to government inspection, as are vessels operated on navigable waters. There was plumbing in the structure, and it was connected with the city water system; it obtained current for electric light from the city plant, and had telephone connections. Appellant's office and quarters for the men in charge were located in one end of the structure. There were floats and an apron making a driveway between the land and a door near each end. The wharfboat was used to transfer freight between steamboats and land and from one steamboat to another. Some shippers paid fixed monthly charges for storage of their goods on the structure and for services in transferring them to and from steamboats. Charges made for services performed by its use were for storage and handling, and not for transportation.\n The rule of limited liability of owners of vessels is an ancient one. It has been administered in the courts of admiralty in Europe from time immemorial, and by statute applied in England for nearly two centuries. See Providence & New York S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 3 S. Ct. 379, 617, \n109 U.S. 578\n, 593; The Main v. Williams, 14 S. Ct. 486, \n152 U.S. 122\n, 127. Our statutes establishing the rule were enacted to promote the building of ships, to encourage the business of navigation, and in that respect to put this country on the same footing with other countries. See Moore v. American Transportation Co., 24 How. 1, 39; Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104, 121. The rule should be \n\n[271 U.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n applied having regard to the purposes it is intended to subserve and the reasons on which it rests.\n The only question presented is whether appellant's wharfboat was a 'vessel' at the time it sank. It was an aid to river traffic, but it was not used to carry freight from one place to another. It was not practically capable of being used as a means of transportation. It served at Evansville as an office, warehouse, and wharf, and was not taken from place to place. The connections with the water, electric light, and telephone systems of the city evidence a permanent location. It performed no function that might not have been performed as well by an appropriate structure on the land and by a floating stage or platform permanently attached to the land. It did not encounter perils of navigation to which craft used for transportation are exposed. There appears to be no reason for the application of the rule of limited liability. Many cases, involving a determination of what constitutes a vessel within the purview of the statute have been before the courts; but no decision has been cited, and we have found none, that supports the contention that this wharfboat was a vessel. Cf. Cope v. Valette Dry Dock Co., 7 S. Ct. 336, \n119 U.S. 625\n, 629; The Robert W. Parsons, 24 S. Ct. 8, \n191 U.S. 17\n, 30; Ruddiman v. A Scow Platform (D.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 251\nArgued: Decided: November 29, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 620, 621]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John O'Gara and Benjamin L. McKinley, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 620, 625]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, indicted with others in the Northern district of California, was convicted of conspiracy to violate section 215 of the Criminal Code. 35 Stat. 1088, 1130 (Comp. St.  10385). The judgment was affirmed. 7 F.(2d) 961. And see Lupipparu v. United States (C. C. A.) 5 F.( 2d) 504.\n The question for decision is whether the use of the mails for the purpose of obtaining money by means of threats of murder or bodily harm is a scheme to defraud \n\n[272 U.S. 620, 626]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of that section. Petitioner contends that sending threatening letters for that purpose involves coercion and not fraud. The government insists that in a broad sense threats constitute fraud, and that the section covers the obtaining of money or property of another by dishonest means. The words of the statute relied on follow:\n'Whoever, having devised ... any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, ... shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme ... place, or cause to be placed, any letter, ... in any post office, ... to be sent or delivered ...' shall be punished.\n\n Questions somewhat similar have been considered in the lower courts, but the issue here presented has never been decided by this court.\n In Weeber v. United States (C. C.) 62 F. 740, the defendant was convicted under the provision here in question, then a part of section 5480, Revised Statutes. The scheme to defraud alleged was this: One Kearney pretending to have a claim against Stephens placed it in defendant's hands for collection. An action was then pending in the federal court brought by the United States against Stephens. Defendant caused to be mailed a letter purporting to be from the United States attorney to himself in reference to furnishing testimony tending to show Stephens liable to the government, and then caused the letter to be seen by Stephens intending that he would be frightened into paying the false claim in order to prevent disclosures to the United States attorney. The court held the indictment good and affirmed the conviction. But in that case there were involved trickery and deceit as well as threat. The contention that threats to injure do not constitute a scheme to defraud does not appear to have been made; at any rate, it was not discussed in the opinion. \n\n[272 U.S. 620, 627]\n\u00a0\n In Horman v. United States, 116 F. 350, 53 C. C. A. 570, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit affirmed a conviction under section 5480. The defendant and others, pretending to have knowledge of crimes committed by Douglass and others, threatened to make them public unless given $7,000. The purpose of the conspiracy was to obtain money by means akin to, if not technically, blackmail and extortion. The court construed the section and said the words 'to defraud' were not descriptive of the character of the artifice of scheme but rather of the wrongful purpose involved in devising it. And it held that (page 352 (53 C. C. A. 572)):\n'If the scheme or artifice in its necessary consequence is one which is calculated to injure another, to deprive him of his property wrongfully, then it is to defraud within the meaning of the statute.'\n\n On the basis of these cases the government argues that the statute embraces all dishonest methods of deprivation the gist of which is the use of the mails.\n But in Hammerschmidt v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 182\n, 44 S. Ct. 511, we held that section 37 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201), denouncing conspiracy 'to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose,' did not condemn a conspiracy to defeat the selective draft by inducing persons to refuse to register. It is there said that the decision in Horman v. United States went to the verge, that since that decision section 5480 had been amended to make its scope clearer, and that its construction in that case could not be used as authority to include within the legal definition of a conspiracy to defraud the United States a mere open defiance of the governmental purpose to enforce a law. And in the discussion of the words 'to defraud' it is said that they primarily mean to cheat, that they usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane, or overreaching, and that they do not extend to theft by violence, or to robbery or burglary. \n\n[272 U.S. 620, 628]\n\u00a0\n The reference in the opinion to 'means that are dishonest' and 'dishonest methods or schemes' does not support the government's construction of the phrase. The contrasts there emphasized and the context indicate the contrary.\n And in Naponiello v. United States, 291 F. 1008, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit-a few days after the decision of the Hammerschmidt Case, but without out reference to it-held that the use of the mails to send a letter to extort money by threats is not to promote a scheme to defraud within section 215; and said the words there used to show unmistakably that the victim's money must be taken from him by deceit.\n Undoubtedly the obtaining of money by threats to injury or kill is more reprehensible than cheat, trick or false pretenses; but that is not enough to require the court to hold that a scheme based on such threats is one to defraud within section 215. While, for the ascertainment of the true meaning and intention of the words relied on regard is to be had to the evils that called forth the enactment and to the rule that a strict construction of penal statutes does not require the words to be so narrowed as to exclude cases that fairly may be said to be covered by them, it is not permissible for the court to search for an intention that the words themselves do not suggest. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95.\n If threats to kill or injure unless money is forthcoming do not constitute a scheme to defraud within the statute, there is none in this case. The only means employed by petitioner and his co-conspirators to obtain the money demanded was the coercion of fear. A comprehensive definition of 'scheme or artifice to defraud' need not be undertaken. the phrase is a broad one and extends to a great variety of transactions. But broad as are the words 'to defraud,' they do not include threat and coercion through fear or force. The rule laid down in the Horman \n\n[272 U.S. 620, 629]\n\u00a0\n Case includes every scheme that in its necessary consequences is calculated to injure another or to deprive him of his property wrongfully. That statement goes beyond the meaning that justly may be attributed to the language used. The purpose of the conspirators was to compel action in accordance with their demand. The attempt was by intimidation and not by anything in the nature of deceit or fraud as known to the law or as generally understood. The words of the act suggest no intention to include the obtaining of money by threats. There are no constructive offenses; and, before one can be punished, it must be shown that his case is plainly within the statute. United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 10 S. Ct. 625. In United States v. Chase, \n135 \nU.S. 255\n, 10 S. Ct. 756, the indictment was under section 1 of the Act of July 12, 1876, c. 186, 19 Stat. 90, declaring 'every ... book, pamphlet, picture, paper, writing, print or other publication of an indecent character' to be unmailable, and making their deposit in the mails an offense. The question was whether to send an obscene letter by mail violated that section. The court held that the letter was not a writing within the meaning of the Statute. It said (page 261 (10 S. Ct. 758)):\n'We recognize the value of the rule of construing statutes with reference to the evil they were designed to suppress as an important aid in ascertaining the meaning of language in them which is ambiguous and equally susceptible of conflicting constructions. But this court has repeatedly held that this rule does not apply to instances which are not embraced in the language employed in the statute, or implied from a fair interpretation of its context, even though they may involve the same mischief which the statute was designed to suppress.'\n\n The threats in question cannot fairly be held to constitute a scheme to defraud.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v.

That act provides:\n'Sec. 7. That no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.\n\n'No corporation shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of two or more corporations engaged in commerce where the effect of such acquisition, or the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise, may be to substantially lessen competition between such corporations, or any of them, whose stock or other share capital is so acquired, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce. ...'

Comp. St.  8835j.\n\n Section 5 of the Act to Create a Federal Trade Commission, approval September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 719 (Comp. St.  8836e), declares unfair methods of competition in commerce unlawful, prescribes the procedure to be followed, and gives the Commission power to require an offending party to cease and desist from such methods. This section is not presently important; the challenged orders sought to enforce obedience to section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n II. No. 96. The Western Meat Company, a California corporation, and the Nevada Packing Company, of Nevada, were interstate competitors engaged in manufacturing, selling and distributing meat products. December 30, 1916, the former purchased all stock of the latter and has continued to hold it. In a proceeding begun November 24, 1919, the Commission found such purchase and con- \n\n[272 U.S. 554, 558]\n\u00a0\n tinued ownership contrary to law and entered an order directing-\n That the respondent, Western Meat Company, shall forthwith cease and desist from violating the provisions of section 5 of said Act of Congress approved September 26, 1914, entitled 'An act to create a Federal Trade Commission, to define its powers and duties, and for other purposes,' and also the provisions of section 7 of said Act of Congress approved October 15, 1914, entitled 'An act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes,' and particularly to so divest itself absolutely of all capital stock of the Nevada Packing Company as to include in such divestment the Nevada Packing Company's plant and all property necessary to the conduct and operation thereof as a complete, going packing plant and organization, and so as to neither directly or indirectly retain any of the fruits of the acquisition of the capital stock of said Nevada Packing Company, a corporation.\n That in such divestment, no stock or property above mentioned to be divested shall be sold or transferred, directly or indirectly, to any stockholder, officer, director, employee, or agent of, or anyone otherwise directly or indirectly connected with or under the control or influence of, respondent or any of its officers, directors or stockholders or the officers, directors, or stockholders of any of respondent's subsidiaries or affiliated companies.\n The court below held this order went beyond the Commission's authority and directed that it be modified by eliminating 'the injunction against the acquisition by the petitioner of the plant and property of the Nevada Packing Company.'\n Respondent maintains that the Commission's authority is strictly limited by the statute, and that where there has been an unlawful purchase of stock it can do no more than enter 'an order requiring such person to cease and \n\n[272 U.S. 554, 559]\n\u00a0\n desist from such violations and divest itself of the stock held'; also, that the Commission has no power to prevent or annul the purchase of a competitor's plant and business, as distinguished from stock therein.

Ct. 150, 19 A. L. R. 882; Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Refining Co., \n261 \nU.S. 463, 475\n, 43 S. Ct. 450-are relied upon.\n Without doubt the Commission may not go beyond the words of the statute properly construed, but they must be read in the light of its general purpose and applied with a view to effectuate such purpose. Preservation of established competition was the great end which the Legislature sought to secure.\n The order here questioned was entered when respondent actually held and owned the stock contrary to law. The Commission's duty was to prevent the continuance of this unlawful action by an order directing that it cease and desist therefrom and divest itself of what it had no right to hold. Further violations of the act through continued ownership could be effectively prevented only by requiring the owner wholly to divest itself of the stock and thus render possible once more free play of the competition which had been wrongfully suppressed. The purpose which the lawmakers entertained might be wholly defeated if the stock could be further used for securing the competitor's property. And the same result would follow a transfer to one controlled by or acting for the respondent.\n Although the respondent held all the capital stock, the plant and other property of the Nevada Packing Company had not been acquired. The Commission directed that it so divest itself of all this stock as to include in such divestment the packing company's plant and property necessary to the operation thereof, etc. Taken liter- \n\n[272 U.S. 554, 560]\n\u00a0\n ally, this goes beyond the situation revealed by the record, but thereof, etc. Taken literally, this goes beyond the existing circumstances. Divestment of the stock must be actual and complete and may not be effected, as counsel for respondent admitted was intended, by using the control resulting therefrom to secure title to the possessions of the packing company and then to dissolve it. Properly understood, the order was within the Commission's authority, and the court below erred in directing the elimination therefrom of the above-quoted words. Its decree must be modified accordingly and then affirmed.\n III. No. 213. The Commission entered complaint against the petitioner March 1, 1921, and charged that the latter, contrary to section 7 of the Clayton Act, first acquired the stock of four competing corporations- Lockport Glass Company, Essex Glass Company, Travis Glass Company, and Woodbury Glass Company-and thereafter took transfers of all the business and assets of the first three and caused their dissolution, October 20, 1920, December 18, 1920, and January 13, 1921, respectively. Having found the facts concerning a rather complicated series of transactions, the Commission ruled that the acquisitions of all these stocks were unlawful and ordered the petitioner to cease and desist from ownership, operation, management and control of the assets, properties, rights, etc., of the Lockport, Essex, and Travis Glass Companies secured through such stock ownership, and to divest itself of the assets, properties, rights, etc., formerly held by them; also, that it should divest itself of the stock of the Woodbury Glass Company.\n The court below held that the last-named company was not in competition with petitioner, within the meaning of the statute, and modified the order accordingly. Therein we agree, and to that extent affirm its decree. \n\n[272 U.S. 554, 561]\n\u00a0\n The court further ruled, in effect, that as the stocks of the remaining three companies were unlawfully obtained, and ownership of the assets came through them, the Commission properly ordered the holder so to dispossess itself of the properties as to restore prior lawful conditions. With this we cannot agree. When the Commission institutes a proceeding based upon the holding of stock contrary to section 7 of the Clayton Act, its power is limited by section 11 to an order requiring the guilty person to cease and desist from such violation, effectually to divest itself of the stock, and to make no further use of it. The act has no application to ownership of a competitioner's property and business obtained prior to any action by the Commission, even though this was brought about through stock unlawfully held. The purpose of the act was to prevent continued holding of stock and the peculiar evils incident thereto. If purchase of property has produced an unlawful status, a remedy is provided through the courts. Sherman Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.); Act to Create a Federal Trade Commission, c. 311,  11, 38 Stat. 717, 724, (Comp. St.  8836k); Clayton Act, c. 323,  4, 15, 16, 38 Stat. 730, 731, 736, 737 (Comp.

A complaint against petitioner, filed November 24, 1919, charged that in 1917 and 1918 it had unlawfully obtained stock in two competing companies-Moultrie Packing Company and Andalusia Packing Company- and thereafter through the use of this obtained title to their business and physical property. The findings support the charge. The Commission ordered-\n\n\n[272 U.S. 554, 562]\n\u00a0\n 'That respondent, Swift & Co., within six calendar months from and after the date of the service of a copy of this order upon it, shall\n\n\n (1)\n Cease and desist from further violating section 7 of the Clayton Act by continuing to own or hold, either directly or indirectly, by itself or by any one for its use and benefit, any of the capital stock of the Moultrie Packing Company and of the Andalusia Packing Company, or either of them, and cease and desist from holding, controlling and\/or operating, or causing to be held, controlled and\/or operated by others for its use and benefit, the former property and business either of the said Moultrie Packing Company or of the said Andalusia Packing Company, which have been held, controlled and operated by respondent and its employe  and agents, following and as a result of respondent's unlawful acquisition of the capital stocks of said named corporations; and to that end, respondent shall\n\n\n (2)\n So divest itself of all the capital stocks heretofore acquired by respondent, including all the fruits of such acquisitions, in whatever form they now are, whether held by respondent or by any one for its use and benefit, of the Moultrie Packing Company, a corporation, and of the Andalusia Packing Company, a corporation, or either of them, in such manner that there shall not remain to respondent, either directly or indirectly, any of the fruits of said acquisitions, including the control and\/or operations of said corporations, or either of them, resulting from such acquisitions and\/or holdings of such capital stocks.\n\n\n (3)\n In so divesting itself of such capital stocks respondent shall not sell or transfer, either directly or indirectly, any of such capital stocks to any officer, director, stockholder, employe or agent of respondent, or to any person under the control of respondent, or to any partnership or \n\n[272 U.S. 554, 563]\n\u00a0\n corporation either directly or indirectly owned or controlled by respondent.\n The court below denied a petition for review and the matter is here by certiorari. As all property and business of the two competing companies were acquired by the petitioner prior to the filing of the complaint, it is evident that no practical relief could be obtained through an order merely directing petitioner to divest itself of valueless stock. As stated in No. 213, we are of opinion that under sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act the Commission is without authority to require one who has secured actual title and possession of physical property before proceedings were begun against it to dispose of the same, although secured through an unlawful purchase of stock. The courts must administer whatever remedy there may be in such situation. The order of the Commission should have been reviewed and set aside, and judgment to that effect will be entered here.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting in part).\n In my opinion, the purpose of section 7 of the Clayton Act was not, as stated by the court, merely 'to prevent continued holding of the stock and the peculiar evils incident thereto.' It was also to prevent the peculiar evils resulting therefrom. The institution of a proceeding before the Commission under section 7 does not operate, like an injunction, to restrain a company from acquiring the assets of the controlled corporation by means of the stock held in violation of that section. If, in spite of the commencement of such a proceeding, the company took a transfer of the assets, the Commission could, I assume, require a retransfer of the assets, so as to render effective the order of divestiture of the stock.

BOYKIN(1926)\nNo. 308\nArgued: May 4, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur G. Powell, of Atlanta, Ga., Thomas W. Hardwick, of Dublin, Ga., and Marion Smith, Max F. Goldstein, and John D. Little, all of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hooper Alexander and James W. Austin, both of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal is without merit, and the interlocutory decree below must be affirmed.\n By an Act approved August 20, 1906, the Legislature of Georgia declared unlawful certain agreements for the purchase or sale, for future delivery, of designated commodities, and made participation therein a misdemeanor. It also prohibited maintenance of an office where such agreements are offered, and specified what should constitute prima facie evidence of guilty connection therewith. Laws 1906, p. 95.\n Appellees, Boykin and Lowry, are the solicitor general and sheriff of Fulton county, Ga., charged respectively with the general duty of prosecuting and arresting offenders. \n\n[271 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n Subsequent to the passage of the act of 1906, appellants, citizens of states other than Georgia, established in Fulton county a branch office, with the ordinary quotation board, where they solicited and received orders, accompanied by margins, to purchase or sell cotton for future delivery on the New York and New Orleans Exchanges. They were threatened with arrest and prosecution for violating the act of 1906. By a bill in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia they challenged the validity of that statute upon the ground that it interfered with the free flow of commerce merce between the states. They alleged that the threatened action would deprive them of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and asked that appellees be enjoined from proceeding therewith.\n The District Court, three judges sitting, having heard the matter, concluded that the statute condemned gambling transactions only, did not affect interstate commerce, and that the proposed proceedings against appellants would not deprive them of any right. The request for preliminary injunction was accordingly refused, and this appeal followed. 3 F. (2d) 674.\n The trial court discovered no necessity for the relief asked. The record discloses no adequate reason for a different conclusion here. There was no abuse of discretion.\n Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764, and following cases have established the doctrine that, when absolutely necessary for protection of constitutional rights, courts of the United States have power to enjoin state officers from instituting criminal actions. But this may not be done, except under extraordinary circumstances, where the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate. Ordinarily, there should be no interference with such officers; primarily, they are charged with the duty of prosecuting offenders against the laws of the state, and \n\n[271 U.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n must decide when and how this is to be done. The accused should first set up and rely upon his defense in the state courts, even though this involves a challenge of the validity of some statute, unless it plainly appears that this course would not afford adequate protection. The Judicial Code provides ample opportunity for ultimate review here in respect of federal questions. An intolerable condition would arise, if, whenever about to be charged with violating a state law, one were permitted freely to contest its validity by an original proceeding in some federal court.

TAFOYA(1926)\nNo. 88\nArgued: January 7, 1926Decided: March 15, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Markell, of Baltimore, Md., and C. J. Roberts, of Santa Fe , N. M., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. J. Helmick, of Albuquerque, N. M., for appellees.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought to prevent the State Corporation Commission of New Mexico from suspending the right of the plaintiff to do business in that State. A final decree was entered by which it was declared that the defendants intend to suspend that right 'for the sole \n\n[270 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n reason that the plaintiff has made payments to its agents in states other than New Mexico in connection with the procurement of business made, written and placed by the plaintiff in New Mexico'; that such payments are unlawful by virtue of section 2820 of the New Mexico Code of 1915, as amended by chapter 195 of the Laws of 1921, and that the section so far as it makes such payments unlawful and authorizes the suspension because of this is constitutional. On this ground the bill was dismissed. The plaintiffs contending that the statute as construed and applied is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment appealed to this Court.\n The statute in question, s 2820 of the Code of 1915 as amended in 1921, purports to make it 'unlawful for any insurance company authorized to do business in New Mexico ... to pay, ... either directly or indirectly, and fee, brokerage or other emolument of any nature to any person, firm or corporation not a resident of the State of New Mexico, for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy or policies of insurance covering risks in New Mexico. Any insurance company violating this section shall have its certificates of authority to do business in this State suspended for not less than one year'-the suspension to be removed only upon a written pledge that the section will be observed. This section has been repealed by an act of 1925 (Laws 1925, c. 135), which substitutes the more moderate requirement that the policy must be delivered, the premium collected and the full commission retained by an agent in New Mexico, with authority to that agent to employ a licensed non-resident broker to collect the premiums, etc., and to pay him within limits. The question has been suggested whether this repeal does not require us to dismiss the case. But the Constitution of New Mexico provides that 'no act of the Legislature shall affect the right or remedy of either party ... in any pending case' (art. 4, s 34). It is at least \n\n[270 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n possible that the State Courts might hold that the plaintiff was still liable to lose its license on the old ground. Therefore it seems to us just that we should proceed to deal with the further questions raised, as both parties desire.\n It is suggested that the District Court had no jurisdiction because the bill does not allege that the statute is unconstitutional, but only that the statute as construed and applied by the defendants is so. But even if the statute did not plainly purport to justify and require the threatened action, or if the bill fairly taken did not import a denial of the constitutionality of the law as applied to this case, the plaintiff still would be entitled to come into a Court of the United States to prevent such an alleged violation of its constitutional rights. Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., 28 S. Ct. 7, \n207 U.S. 20\n, 12 Ann. Cas. 757; Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, 33 S. Ct. 312, \n227 U.S. 278\n; Cuyahoga River Power Co. v. Akron, 36 S. Ct. 402, \n240 U.S. 462\n.\n Coming then to the merits we assume in favor of the defendants that the State has the power and constitutional right arbitrarily to exclude the plaintiff without other reason than that such is its will. But it has been held a great many times that the most absolute seeming rights are qualified, and in some circumstances become wrong. One of the most frequently recurring instances is when the so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result. Frick v. Pennsylvania, 45 S. Ct. 603, \n268 U.S. 473\n; American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 41 S. Ct. 499, \n256 U.S. 350\n, 358; Badders v. United States, 36 S.

Thus the right to exclude a foreign corporation cannot be used to prevent it from resorting to a federal Court, Terral v. Burke Construction Co., 42 S. Ct. 188, \n257 U.S. 529\n, 21 A. L.

A State cannot regulate the conduct of a foreign railroad corporation in another jurisdiction, even though the company has tracks and does business in the State making the attempt. New York, Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 14 S. Ct. 952, \n153 \nU.S. 628, 646\n, 854 S..\n The case last cited was one of an attempt to regulate the corporation's payments in another State. By the same principle on even stronger grounds the corporation cannot be prevented from employing and paying those whom it needs for its business outside the State. The difficulty was fully appreciated by the counsel for the appellee and he therefore sought to limit the generality of the words, at least in the case of agents, and to make out that the object was to prevent the use of dummy agents in the State. It was suggested that agents were paid by commissions at well known conventional rates and that the statute meant to forbid the dividing of these commissions, and in that way to prevent the work being done and paid for elsewhere, while nominal agents in New Mexico were paid small sums for the use of their names. In short it is said the purpose was to secure responsible men to represent the company on the spot. But whether such an interpretation would save the act or not it is impossible to limit it in that way. It forbids the payment of any emolument of any nature to any person for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy covering risks in New Mexico. The words go beyond any legitimate interest of the State, and although the decree is based only on payments to agents it does not declare that the payments thus made prevented the payment of appropriate commissions to the agents in the State nor does the statute limit its prohibition in that way. \n\n[270 U.S. 426, 436]\n\u00a0\n The determination of the Commission to suspend the plaintiff purported to be based upon a letter written by it in reply to a notice. In this letter it appeared only that agents or branch offices in other states were paid for services of value by commission on such basis as was agreed upon outside of New Mexico, but not that there was in any case a deduction from appropriate commissions inside the State. The threat and the decree, therefore, test the validity of the statute in its extreme application and furnish no ground for an attempt to read it as meaning less than it says. See further Palmetto Fire Insurance Co. v. Beha (D. C. S. D. N. Y., Nov. 10, 1925) 13 F. (2d) 500; St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 43 S. Ct. 125, \n260 U.S. 346\n.\n Decree reversed.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n This cause was begun January 8, 1924. Defendants were the members of the State Corporation Commission and the bank examiner. Section 2814, Code of New Mexico 1915, forbade the carrying on of business within the state by any insurance company 'unless it shall procure from the superintendent of insurance a certificate stating that the requirements of the laws of this state have been complied with, and authorizing it to do business.' These certificates expired annually on the last day of February. In 1921 the powers and duties of the superintendent of insurance were transferred to the bank examiner under general control and supervision of the Corporation Commission.\n Section 2820 of the Code, as amended, provided that no foreign insurance company shall transact business in the state except through duly appointed resident agents; declared it unlawful to pay any emolument to a nonresident for obtaining policies covering risks therein; and authorized the exclusion of any company which failed to observe this inhibition. \n\n[270 U.S. 426, 437]\n\u00a0\n The bill alleges that although the complainant had been duly licensed to transact business in New Mexico for many years defendants were threatening to suspend the license therefor because of supposed violations of section 2820. It asks a decree declaring that section unconstitutional in so far as payments to nonresidents for procuring insurance were prohibited; and that defendants be restrained from attempting to revoke or refusing to renew the license certificate.\n The act effective March 20, 1925, codified the insurance laws of the state; expressly repealed former statutes regulating the business; transferred the powers of the bank examiner to the corporation commission, and charged the superintendent of the department of insurance with general administration of the law. It sets up an entirely new system of control and contains no provision concerning payments to outside agents like the one challenged by complainant. It provides:\n'Upon the application of any insurance company for a license to transact an insurance business in the state of New Mexico, the superintendent shall immediately satisfy himself that the said company ... has ... complied with all the ... requirements of this act, and shall thereupon be obligated to issue a license to the said company authorizing it to transact the forms of insurance permitted under its articles of incorporation and authorized under this act for any one insurance company to transact.' Section 70.\n\n The bill questions the validity of a statute which was repealed in 1925. There is no effective remedy which this or any other court can now grant under its allegations and prayers. The cause has become moot and should be treated accordingly.\n Mr. Justice BRANDELS and Mr. Justice SANFORD concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Justices McReynolds, Brandeis, and Sanford, in a separate opinion, hold the cause moot. \n\n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT. BANK OF GUTHRIE CENTER v. ANDERSON(1926)\nNo. 26\nArgued: January 27, 1925Decided: January 4, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. G. Gamble, of Des Moines, Iowa, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Ben J. Gibson, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Earl W. Vincent, of Guthrie Center, Iowa, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by a national bank on behalf of its shareholders to restrain the collection of a tax levied against \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n the latter on their shares. The bank is located at Guthrie Center, in Guthrie county, Iowa. The defendants, who are county officers charged with the duty of collecting taxes, interposed a general demurrer to the petition. The demurrer was sustained, judgment against the plaintiff was entered, and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. 196 Iowa, 587, 192 N. W. 6.\n The petition assails the tax on several distinct grounds, only one of which is relied on here. The allegations displaying this ground are:\n'The said tax as entered upon the tax list by the county auditor is void, because it is a discrimination between bank stock and moneyed capital invested in competition therewith, and in violation of section 5219, Revised Statutes of the United States. Plaintiff avers: That in the town of Guthrie Center, Iowa, the total levy for local, county and state tax purposes was 143 5\/10 mills on the dollar for the year 1920, and said tax on plaintiff and its shareholders was estimated and charged at said rate. ... That under the laws of Iowa a levy of only 5 mills on the dollar is imposed upon notes, mortgages, and other evidences of debt, and investments of individuals in securities, which represent money at interest, and other evidence of indebtedness such as normally enter into the business of banking, and the tax for the year 1920 upon moneyed capital of individual citizens of Guthrie county, Iowa, and of the town of Guthrie Center, engaged in competition with plaintiff, was so levied and computed. That the amount of notes, mortgages, and other evidences of money loaned and put out at interest by individual citizens in the county of Guthrie, Iowa, was a very large sum, which amount plaintiff is unable to state, but upon information and belief plaintiff charges said amount to be more than $5,000,000, which were included in the 1920 assessment, and upon which the tax levy was \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n but 5 mills on the dollar; while the total of all bank stock, including state and national, in Guthrie county, Iowa, does not exceed the sum of $316,852. That approximately $5,000,000 of moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens, consisting chiefly of notes, mortgages, and money loaned at interest, was taxed for the year 1920 in Guthrie county, Iowa, under the laws of Iowa, at 5 mills on the dollar.'\n\n'That said assessment is erroneous, in that it is contrary to the provisions of section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, because by said assessment the shares of stock of the plaintiff are subjected to a greater assessment and tax than is imposed upon many capital in the hands of individual citizens in said state used and utilized in the same business.'\n\n The Supreme Court of the state, in the fore part of its opinion, summarizes the several grounds on which the bank urged it to hold the tax invalid. The ground relied on here, as there summarized, is:\n'That the (state) statute providing for a tax of five mills on the dollar of moneyed capital loaned and invested in competition with national banks discriminates against the same and is void under section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States' (Comp. St .  9784).\n\n The record also shows that in that court the defendants recognized that the bank was contending 'its shares of stock are taxed at a greater rate under the Iowa law than is moneyed capital,' contrary to the restrictions of the federal statute, and that they made the counter contention that 'the law under which it is sought to hold appellant bank liable for the 1920 taxes does not violate section 5219 of the United States Revised Statutes.'\n True, the Supreme Court in the latter part of its opinion says:\n'It is not claimed that section 1310 of the statute (the state law) is invalid, or that ample provision is not made thereby for the assessment of 'other moneyed capital' in the hands of individuals or other owners at the same rate \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n as national and state banks are taxed, when invested in competition therewith.'\n\n At first this seems a contradiction of the court's earlier statement. But these statements are explained and the seeming conflict dispelled by what otherwise appears in the record, which is that the bank was making the alternative contentions that the state law, if construed and applied according to its words, does not permit any discrimination against national bank shares and is in accord with the federal statute, but, if construed and applied as sustaining what is alleged in the petition, it permits the discrimination which the federal statute forbids, and is in that respect invalid.\n The case is here on writ of error, the substance of the assignment of errors being that the Supreme Court of the state, although holding that the state law permits the discrimination against national bank shares alleged in the petition, denied the bank's contention that, when so construed and applied, that law is in conflict with the federal statute.\n A petition for review on writ of certiorari also was presented and its consideration was postponed to the hearing on the writ of error.\n By a motion to dismiss, the jurisdiction of this court on the writ of error is challenged on the grounds, first, that the state court rested its judgment on the construction and sufficiency of the allegations of the petition and its decision of that question is conclusive here; and, secondly, that the judgment is right independently of any ruling on the asserted federal question, in that the suit is not one in which relief may be had in equity, because (a) an adequate remedy at law may be had under the local law by paying the tax and suing to recover the money, (b) the bank has not exercised the local statutory right of appealing from the action of the county officers in imposing the tax, and (c) there has been no payment or tender of so much of the tax as would be due if the five- mills levy were applied to the shares.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 341, 346]\n\u00a0\n Plainly, the first ground cannot be maintained. Whether a pleading sets up a sufficient right of action or defense, grounded on the Constitution or a law of the United States, is necessarily a question of federal law, and, where a case coming from a state court presents that question, this court must determine for itself the sufficiency of the allegations displaying the right or defense, and is not concluded by the view taken of them by the state court. Mitchell v. Clark, \n110 \nU.S. 633, 645\n, 4 S. Ct. 170; Boyd v. Thayer, \n143 \nU.S. 135, 180\n, 12 S. Ct. 375; Covington and Lexington Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578, 595\n, 17 S. Ct. 198; Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 20 S. Ct. 687. The principle is general, and is a necessary element of this court's power to review judgments of state courts in cases involving the application and enforcement of federal laws. Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 U.S. 228\n 24, 44 S. Ct. 13.\n The second ground is not better. The Supreme Court of the State treated the case as cognizable in equity and perceived no obstacle to a consideration of the merits as displayed in the petition. In this that court was proceeding within limits where the state laws and practice were controlling, and its action is not open to revision here. In cases coming from state courts this court's power and concern are specially directed to rulings made or refused on federal questions. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 638; Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization, \n239 \nU.S. 441, 444\n, 36 S. Ct. 141.\n With the objections just considered out of the way, it suffices to say this court's jurisdiction on the writ of error has full support in Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S. Ct. 106. The motion to dismiss is accordingly overruled, and the petition for certiorari is denied.\n The state court holds that the state law authorizes the taxation shown in the petition, and, as this ruling on a purely state question must be accepted here, we turn to \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 347]\n\u00a0\n the question, chiefly pressed on our attention, whether the state law, so construed and applied, conflicts with the federal statute. In approaching its solution there is need for having in mind the occasion for the federal statute and the purpose and words of the restriction therein which is said to have been violated here.\n National banks are not merely private moneyed institutions, but agencies of the United States created under its laws to promote its fiscal policies; and hence the banks, their property, and their shares cannot be taxed under state authority, except as Congress consents, and then only in conformity with the restrictions attached to its consent. Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 44 S. Ct. 23, and cases cited. The early legislation respecting these banks contained a restricted consent, which afterwards became section 5219 of the Revised Statutes. By it Congress assented to the taxation of the shares to their owners under the laws of the state where the bank was located, subject to the restriction that 'the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state,' and further assented to the taxation of the real property of the bank for state, county, and municipal purposes 'to the same extent, according to its value, as other real property is taxed.' This consent thus restricted was in force when the tax here assailed was levied.\n The restriction on the taxation of the shares often had been considered by this court. The earlier decisions have been reviewed from time to time in later cases, and all, taken collectively, may be summarized as showing, so far as is material here-\n\n 1. \nThe purpose of the restriction is to render it impossible for any state, in taxing the shares, to create and foster an unequal and unfriendly competition with national banks, by favoring shareholders in state banks or individuals interested in private banking or engaged in opera- \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 348]\n\u00a0\n tions and investments normally common to the business of banking. Mercantile National Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 155\n, 7 S. Ct. 826; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, supra, 116.\n\n 2. \nThe term 'other moneyed capital,' in the restriction, is not intended to include all moneyed capital not invested in national bank shares, but only that which is employed in such may as to bring it into substantial competition with the business of national banks. Mercantile National Bank v. New York, supra, 157; Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, \n166 \nU.S. 440, 461\n, 17 S. Ct. 629\n\n\n 3. Moneyed capital is brought into such competition where it is invested in shares of state banks or in private banking, and also where it is employed, substantially as in the loan and investment features of banking, in making investments, by way of loan, discount or otherwise, in notes, bonds or other securities with a view to sale or repayment and reinvestment. Mercantile National Bank v. New York, supra, 155, 157; Palmer v. McMahon, \n133 \nU.S. 660, 667\n, 668 S., 10 S. Ct. 324; Talbot v. Silver Bow County, \n139 \nU.S. 438, 447\n, 11 S. Ct., 594.\n\n 4. \nThe Restriction is not intended to exact mathematical equality in the taxing of national bank shares and such other moneyed capital, nor to do more than require such practical equality as is reasonably attainable in view of the differing situations of such properties. But every clear discrimination against national bank shares and in favor of a relatively material part of other moneyed capital employed in substantial competition with national banks is a violation of both the letter and spirit of the restriction. People v. Weaver, \n100 U.S. 539\n; Boyer v. Boyer, \n113 \nU.S. 689, 701\n, 5 S. Ct. 706; National Bank of Wellington v. Chapman, \n173 \nU.S. 205, 216\n, 19 S. Ct. 407.\n In the briefs there is some discussion as to whether our decision in Merchants' National Bank v. Richmond, \n256 \nU.S. 635\n, 41 S. Ct. 619, attributed to the term 'other moneyed \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 349]\n\u00a0\n capital' a wider meaning than was recognized before. But nothing was said in the opinion indicating that an enlargement was intended. On the contrary, it distinctly accepted the meaning adopted in prior decisions. The case was unusual in one respect. The defendants took the position that the congressional restriction was directed only against discrimination in favor of state banking associations, and they persisted in it to the extent of making no effort at the trial to controvert the evidence produced by the plaintiff to show that a relatively large amount of moneyed capital, taxed at a lower rate than the bank's shares, was employed in substantial competition with the business of the bank. When that position proved untenable by reason of settled rulings to the contrary, the case was left where the outcome turned on the evidence of competition produced by the plaintiff. That evidence was somewhat meager, but in the absence of any counter evidence was held sufficient, and the tax was accordingly pronounced invalid. If the outcome was open to criticism, it was not because any enlarged meaning was attributed to the term 'other moneyed capital,' but because the facts bearing on the question of competition were not sufficiently brought out at the trial and shown in the record.\n By the Act of March 4, 1923, c. 267, 42 Stat. 1499 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  9784), passed after the levy of the tax in question, section 5219 of the Revised Statutes was amended by extending the consent of Congress to any one of three forms of taxation. That of taxing the shares to their owners was retained as one of the three, and the prior restriction was re- enacted with added words, here shown in italics, making it read as follows:\n'In the case of a tax on said shares the tax imposed shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state coming into competition with the business of \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 350]\n\u00a0\n national banks: Provided, that bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness in the hands of individual citizens not employed or engaged in the banking or investment business and representing merely personal investments not made in competition with such business, shall not be deemed moneyed capital within the meaning of this section.'\n\n The defendants say that this re-enactment was intended as a legislative interpretation of the prior restriction, and that the proceedings resulting in its adoption so show. But, assuming that this is true, the situation is not changed; for the re-enactment did no more than to put into express words that which, according to repeated decisions of this court, was implied before. In Mercantile National Bank v. New York, supra, where the terms and purpose of the restriction were much considered, it was distinctly held that the words 'other moneyed capital' must be taken as impliedly limited to capital employed in substantial competition with the business of national banks. In later cases that definition was accepted and given effect as if written into the restriction. It, of course, would exclude bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness when held merely as personal investments by individual citizens not engaged in the banking or investment business, for capital represented by this class of investments is not employed in substantial competition with the business of national banks. Thus in legal contemplation and practical effect the restriction was the same before the re-enactment as after. What bearing a different legislative interpretation might have on a tax already levied, as here, need not be considered.\n With this understanding of the congressional restriction, we come to consider whether the allegations of fact in the petition, admitted by the demurrer, show that the tax on the bank's shares, which the state court regards as authorized by the state law, was imposed con- \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 351]\n\u00a0\n trary to that restriction. The allegations before quoted are all that are material. They declare at the outset and again later on that the shares were subjected to a greater rate of taxation than was imposed on other moneyed capital in the hands of individuals used and utilized in competition with the bank. This declaration is so connected with the intervening allegations that it both colors and explains them. Some of these are directly to the effect that the tax on the shares was computed at the rate of 143.5 mills on the dollar, while that on notes, mortgages, and other evidences of indebtedness, 'such as normally enter into the business of banking' and representing moneyed capital of individual citizens 'engaged in competition' with the bank, was computed at 5 mills on the dollar. Then follows an allegation that the amount of notes, mortgages, and other evidences of indebtedness representing moneyed capital of individual citizens of the county, and taxed at 5 mills on the dollar, was approximately $5,000,000, while the total bank stock, state and national, in the county was not more than $316,852.\n The defendants point out that the allegation last mentioned does not in itself say that the $5,000,000 of other moneyed capital, or any substantial portion of it, was employed in competition with the bank, and from this they argue that the petition falls short of showing a discrimination in favor of a relatively substantial amount of moneyed capital so employed. But that allegation is so related to the others that, to be rightly understood, it must be read with them. We think such a reading shows that it is intended to refer to the notes, mortgages, and other evidences of indebtedness which the others describe as representing moneyed capital of individual citizens engaged in competition with the bank, and that it means that this competing capital, on which the 5-mills tax \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 352]\n\u00a0\n was imposed, approximated $5,000,000, while the bank stock, which was subjected to the tax of 143.5 mills, did not exceed $316,852. Thus understood, the allegation is in accord with the theory on which the others obviously proceed, and serves, with them, to show a serious discrimination against the bank's shares and in favor of a relatively substantial amount of competing moneyed capital.\n It may be that some of the allegations were in such general terms as to be subject to a motion for a more specific statement, but such a motion was not made, and the objection appears not to have been open on the general demurrer. Lamb v. McCormick, 116 Iowa, 169, 174, 175, 89 N. W. 241; B., C. R. & M. R. Co. v. Stewart, 39 Iowa, 267, 272; Noyes v. Mason City, 53 Iowa, 418, 419, 5 N. W. 593.\n The Supreme Court of the state regarded the petition as alleging 'simply that notes and other evidences of money loaned, payment of which is secured by mortgages upon farm lands,' were taxed at a lower rate than the bank shares, and in that view of the allegations the court observed that the tax on the shares was not imposed contrary to the congressional restriction, unless moneyed capital loaned on farm mortgages was to be regarded as loaned or invested in competition with national banks. On this question the court said:\n'Although it does not appear upon the face of the petition, it is a matter of common knowledge that banks, national as well as state, particularly in the rural communities of Iowa, are the instrumentalities through which much the larger portion of farm loans is made; that many banks, as such, or through others with which they are interested, act as agents of insurance companies and other financial institutions having large sums of money to loan upon farm security; and that the money of individuals is either loaned directly by the bank for the accommodation of the owner, who is its customer, or \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 353]\n\u00a0\n loans are made in advance by the bank, and later transferred to such other customers as have money to loan. The money of individuals loaned in the community thereby becomes a source of profit to the bank. It is also well known that money borrowed upon farm security finds its way at once, or ultimately, into the local banks, and is drawn out in the regular course of the borrower's business.\n\n'The Supreme Court of the United States, so far as we are advised, has never had occasion to pass upon the question whether money thus loaned may be said to be invested or loaned in competition with national banks. Upon this question, the decision of the Supreme Court, when announced, will be final; but, until that time arrives, we must adopt and follow our own interpretation of its prior decisions and of the laws of Congress. Surely, moneyed capital loaned and invested by banks, as the agents of their customers, cannot be said to be loaned in competition therewith. Competition means rivalry, and the loaning of money by national and other banks for individuals at a profit, or for the convenience of such owners, is lacking in all the essentials of competition.'\n\n The allegations of the petition already have been quoted at length. They say, 'notes, mortgages, and other evidences of money loaned at interest,' and they describe these securities as 'such as normally enter into the business of banking' and as representing moneyed capital of individuals 'engaged in competition with the plaintiff.' We find in them no specific mention of farm mortgages, nor anything indicating that they refer only to such mortgages. No doubt they are broad enough to include farm mortgages; but this does not weaken the allegation of competition, for while national banks were formerly prohibited from making loans on real estate (Rev. Stats.  5136, 5137 (Comp. St.  9661, 9674); Union National Bank v. Matthews, \n98 U.S. 621\n, 625; National Bank of Genessee v. \n\n[269 U.S. 341, 354]\n\u00a0\n Whitney, \n103 U.S. 90\n), the prohibition was partly withdrawn, and much of that field was opened to such banks by Act Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6,  24, 38 Stat. 273, and Act Sept. 7, 1916, c. 461, 39 Stat. 754 (Comp. St.  9763).\n As the case now stands, we think no effect can be given to what the state court assumes is the practice of banks in rural portions of Iowa in making farm loans as agents for their customers or others. If there be such a practice, it is not a matter which may be noticed and given effect without pleading or proof. If followed by some banks, it may not be followed by others. The state court does not speak of it as universal, but only as followed by 'many banks.' Certainly the record gives no ground for holding that the plaintiff follows it. In this situation the allegation of competition stands unaffected by the assumed practice.\n We conclude that the state law, when construed and applied as authorizing the discrimination against the bank's shares which is charged in the petition, is in that regard in conflict with the restriction in the federal statute.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLELSCHMANN CONST.

Co.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit under the Materialmen's Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 278, c. 280, as amended by the Act of 1905, c. 778.1 It was brought in the name of the United States by Forsberg a materialman, as use plaintiff, in the federal district court for Eastern Virginia, to recover on a bond given by the Fleischmann Construction Company, as contractor, and the National Surety Company, as surety, for the construction, under a contract with the United States, of a torpedo assembly plant in Alexandria. Various materialmen and subcontractors filed intervening petitions in the suit. The plaintiff and the intervenors recovered judgment, 298 F. 320, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 298 F. 330. This writ of error was allowed in March, 1924. A motion was interposed to dismiss the writ of error upon the ground that the record presents no question properly reviewable by this Court, or to affirm the judgment; the consideration of which was postponed to the hearing on the merits.\n The Materialmen's Act, as amended,1 provides that the usual penal bond required of any one entering into a contract with the United States for the construction of any \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n public work, shall contain an additional obligation for the payment by the contractor of all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work. Any such person not thus paid may intervene in any action instituted by the United States on the bond and obtain judgment pro rata with other intervenors, subject to the priority of the claim of the United States. If no suit is brought by the United States 'within six months from the completion and final settlement' of the contract, any such person shall have a right of action upon the bond, and may, 'within one year after the performance and final settlement' of the contract, but not later, commence suit against the contractor and his sureties, in the name of the United States, for his use and benefit, in the federal court of the district in which the contract was performed, and prosecute the same to final judgment and execution. Where suit 'is so instituted by a creditor or by creditors, only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim in such action and be made party thereto within one year from the completion of the work under said contract, and not later.' If the recovery on the bond is inadequate to pay the amounts due to all of the creditors, judgment shall be given to each pro rata.\n The first question to be determined is whether any of the matters presented by the assignment of errors-which relate chiefly to the times at which the suit was brought and the intervening petitions filed-are now open to review upon the record.\n Shortly outlined, the proceedings in the case were these: The suit was brought by Forsberg on April 6, 1921. The declaration alleged that the Construction Company entered into a contract with the United States for the construction of the plant and gave bond to secure its performance, in October, 1918; and that this contract 'was completed and final settlement had on' September 25, 1920, 'more than six months and within one year before' \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n the filing of the suit. The intervening petitions, which were filed between June 15 and September 24, 1921, contained substantially the same general averments as the declaration, and alleged further that they were filed 'before the expiration of one year after the completion' of the contract. In December, 1921, the plaintiff, by leave of court, amended the declaration so as to allege that the original contract had been amended by a supplemental contract in May, 1919, and the defendants had thereafter executed an additional bond; and that the contract as amended 'was completed and final settlement had' on September 25, 1920. The intervening petitions were likewise amended so as to incorporate substantially these same averments, and allege further that the petitions were filed 'before the expiration of one year after the completion of said original contract as amended.'\n The defendants filed demurrers to the original and amended declaration and petitions. All of these were overruled. And the amended declaration and petitions were then put at issue under pleas filed by the defendants.\n By agreement of all the parties the case was referred to a special master to hear the evidence and find the facts. In his report, he found that the work was completed February 5, 1920, and that the date of final settlement was October 1, 1920\n\n\n Thereafter, in April, 1923, before action had been taken on this report, the parties filed a written stipulation, under section 649 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. s 1587), waiving a jury and agreeing that all the issues might be tried and determined by the court.\n In August, the District Judge handed down an extended written opinion in which he considered the entire case as to the facts and law, and concluded, inter alia, that the master had found correctly that the date of the final settlement was October 1, 1920; that it was unnecessary to determine the date on which the work had been com- \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n pleted, since the intervenors had filed their petitions within one year after the final settlement; that the actions were not barred because the amendments setting up the supplemental contract were made more than a year after the final settlement, the original and supplemental contracts being one and the same, and the amendments relating back to the bringing of the original suit and the filing of the original petition; and that the claims of the plaintiff and the intervenors were severally established. No special findings of fact had been requested; and none were made.\n On the same day a judgment was entered, which 'for reasons stated' in the opinion, awarded the plaintiff and the intervenors recoveries upon their several claims, the aggregate of which was less than the amount of either bond.\n The defendants, without having excepted to any of the rulings or conclusions of the court or requested any special findings of fact, sued out, in September, a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals. After this writ had issued, however, the District Judge, in October, granted them a 'bill of exceptions,' which recited that the court had filed its opinion and entered its final judgment on the same day, without notice to the parties; set for the various exceptions then, for the first time, noted by the defendants 'to the rulings, finding of fact and conclusions of law by the court' in the opinion and judgment; and stated that, by reason of the circumstances, these exceptions were 'to be taken as severally made at the time thereof and before the entry of judgment thereon.' And later the District Judge granted them another 'bill of exceptions,' embodying the evidence and the proceedings before the master, and setting forth in the same manner other exceptions to be taken, for like reason, as made before the entry of the judgment.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals disposed of the case in a per curiam opinion stating that, while there was a serious \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n question whether there was anything before it because of the want of due exceptions, it preferred to rest the affirmance of the judgment on the merits, as it thought the District Court was clearly right on all the points decided.\n\n 1. \nThe assignment of error challenges the affirmance of the judgment because of the action of the District Court in overruling the demurrers to the original and amended declaration and petitions; in allowing the amendments to the original declaration and petitions; and in making various other 'holdings' and 'findings' in reference to matters of law and fact. It is clear that none of these questions are open to review except those which arise upon the pleadings.\n Section 700 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. s 1668)-re-enacting a like provision in the Act of March 3, 1865, c. 862-provides that when an issue of fact in a civil cause is tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, according to section 649, 'the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial of the cause, if excepted to at the time, and duly presented by a bill of exceptions, may be reviewed' upon writ of error; 'and when the finding is special the review may extend to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.'\n The opinion of the trial judge, dealing generally with the issues of law and fact and giving the reasons for his conclusion, is not a special finding of facts within the meaning of the statute. Insurance Co. v. Tweed, 7 Wall. 44, 51; Dickinson v. Planters' Bank, 16 Wall. 250, 257; Raimond v. Terrebonne Parish, 10 S. Ct. 57, \n132 U.S. 192\n, 194; British Mining Co. v.

And it is settled by repeated decisions, that in the absence of special findings, the general finding of the court is conclusive upon all matters of fact, and prevents any inquiry \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n into the conclusions of law embodied therein, except in so far as the rulings during the progress of the trial were excepted to and duly preserved by bill of exceptions, as required by the statute. Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125, 128; Miller v. Insurance Co., 12 Wall. 285, 300; Dickinson v. Planters' Bank, supra, 257; Insurance Co. v. Folson, 18 Wall. 237, 248; Cooper v.

Ct. 608, \n166 U.S. 388\n, 390; Vicksburg Ry. v. Anderson-Tully Co., 41 S. Ct. 524, \n256 U.S. 408\n, 415; Law v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 175, \n266 U.S. 494\n, 496; Humphreys v. Third National Bank, 75 F. 852, 855, 21 C. C. A. 538; United States v. Stockyards Co., supra, 127. To obtain a review by an appellate court of the conclusions of law a party must either obtain from the trial court special findings which raise the legal propositions, or present the propositions of law to the court and obtain a ruling on them. Norris v. Jackson, supra, 129; Martinton v. Fairbanks, supra, 673 (5 S. Ct. 321). That is, as was said in Humphreys v. Third National Bank, supra, 855 (21 C. C. A. 542), 'he should request special findings of fact by the court, framed like a special verdict of a jury, and then reserve his exceptions to those special findings, if he deems them not to be sustained by any evidence; and if he wishes to except to the conclusions of law drawn by the court from the facts found he should have them separately stated and excepted to. In this way, and in this way only, is it possible for him to review completely the action of the court below upon the merits.'\n These rules necessarily exclude from our consideration all the questions presented by the assignment of errors except those arising on the pleadings. All the others relate either to matters of fact or to conclusions of law embodied in the general finding. These are not open to review, as there were no special findings of fact and no \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n exceptions to the rulings on matters of law were taken during the progress of the trial or duly preserved by a bill of exceptions. The defendants offered no exceptions to the rulings of the court until after the writ of error had issued, transferring jurisdiction of the case to the Court of Appeals. And the recitals in the subsequent 'bills of exceptions' that the exceptions, then for the first time presented, were to be taken as made before the entry of the judgment, are nugatory. A bill of exceptions is not valid as to any matter which was not excepted to at the trial. Walton v. United States, 9 Wheat. 651, 657; Insurance Co. v. Boon, \n95 U.S. 117\n, 127. And it cannot incorporate into the record nunc pro tunc as of the time when an exception should have been taken, one which in fact was not then taken. Walton v. United States, supra, 658; Turner v. Yates, 16 How. 14, 29.\n The statute however, relates only to those rulings of law which are made in the course of the trial, and by its terms has no application to the preliminary rulings of the District Judge made, in the exercise of his general authority, before the issues are submitted to him for hearing under the statutory stipulation. Such rulings on the pleadings and the sufficiency of the complaint are therefore subject to review as in any other case, independently of the statute. Norris v. Jackson, supra, 128; Martinton v. Fairbanks, supra, 673 (5 S. Ct. 321); Lehnen v. Dickson, supra, 72 (13 S. Ct. 481); St. Louis v. Telegraph Co., supra, 390 (17 S. Ct. 608); Vicksburg Railway v. Anderson-Tully Co., supra, 415 (41 S. Ct. 524). And see Campbell v. Boyreau, 21 How. 223, 226, 16 L. Ed 96; Bond v. Dustin, 5 S. Ct. 296, \n112 U.S. 604\n, 606; Erkel v. United States, 169 F. 623, 624, 95 C. C. A. 151, and Ladd Bank v. Hicks Co., 218 F. 310, 311, 134 C. C. A. 106, as to the questions which are open to review where the case is heard by the judge by consent, but without the jurisdictional stipulation.\n Since, therefore, the questions arising on the pleadings in this case are now open to review, the motion to dismiss the writ of error must be denied. \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n 2. This brings us to the consideration of the questions arising on the pleadings as to which errors are assigned. We may assume for present purposes, without deciding, that the defendants did not waive their demurrers by pleading over to the merits after they had been overruled. Compare, however, Young v. Martin, 8 Wall. 354, 357; Stanton v. Embrey, \n93 U.S. 548\n, 553; Teal v. Walker, 4 S. Ct. 420, \n111 U.S. 242\n, 246; Bauserman v. Blunt, 13 S. Ct. 466, \n147 U.S. 647\n, 652; Nalle v. Oyster, 33 S. Ct. 1043, \n230 U.S. 165\n, 174; Denver v. Home Savings Bank, 35 S. Ct. 265, \n236 U.S. 101\n, 104; Harper v. Cunningham, 8 App. D. C. 430, 434.\n The demurrers to the original declaration and petitions were based upon the grounds that they were insufficient in law, since the averment in the declaration that the contract was completed and final settlement had on September 25, 1920, was a mere conclusion of law, and the facts averred did not show that a right of action had accrued or that the court had jurisdiction of the cause when the suit was instituted. And the demurrers to the amended declaration and petitions were based on like grounds, and on the further ground that they set up new causes of action and were not filed within the times required by the Materialmen's Act.\n These demurrers were rightly overruled. The averments in the declaration, as originally filed and as amended, that the contract between the Construction Company and the United States was completed and finally settled on September 25, 1920, were not mere conclusions of law, but specific averments of an ultimate fact, appropriately pleaded. And since, as appeared from the record, the original suit was brought on April 6, 1921, they showed upon their face that it was instituted more than six months and 'within one year after the performance and final settlement' of the contract, as required by the Act; thereby tendering an issue of fact as to the date of the final settlement which was conclusively \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n determined against the defendants by the general finding of the court.\n And although the amended declaration and petitions showing the supplemental contract between the Construction Company and the United States, were filed more than one year after the date of the final settlement, they did not set up new causes of action at a time beyond that permitted by the Act. The original declaration set forth a provision in the original bond that it was given to secure the performance of the contract 'as it now exists or may be modified according to its terms.' And the supplemental contract-a copy of which was attached to and made a part of the amended declaration-specifically provided that it should be regarded as amendatory of the original contract; that all provisions and requirements of the original contract should remain in full force, except as specifically changed; and that the original bond should not be released or otherwise affected, but should remain in full force as though the changes provided for had been included in the original contract; and it expressly recited that the Surety Company, which also signed the supplemental contract, was made a party thereto 'for the purpose of extending the obligation of said bond to cover the changes herein provided.' It is clear that the amended declaration and petitions did not set up new causes of action, but merely supplmented by appropriate allegations the defective statements of the rights which had existed when the original declaration and petitions were filed; and that the amendments when made related back, by operation of law, to the dates on which the original suit was brought and the original petitions filed. Texas Cement Co. v. McCord, 34 S. Ct. 550, \n233 U.S. 157\n, 164; Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, 36 S. Ct. 321, \n240 U.S. 214\n, 222.\n Furthermore, it was not essential that the petitions should allege the date on which the work was completed, in order to show that the intervenors' rights of action had \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 360]\n\u00a0\n accrued when the claims were filed. It is urged that while the Act permits the original suit to be brought 'within one year after the performance and final settlement' of the contract, it requires intervening creditors to file their claims in such action 'within one year from the completion of the work' under the contract. It is obvious that if this latter provision is to be taken literally, the time allowed intervening creditors in which to file their claims would expire earlier than the time allowed for bringing the original suit, since such suit might be instituted within one year after the final settlement, but other creditors could only intervene within one year after the completion of the work, a period necessarily terminating within less than a year after the final settlement.\n The strict letter of an act must, however, yield to its evident spirit and purpose, when this is necessary to give effect to the intent of Congress. Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 12 S. Ct. 511, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 459; Ozawa v. United States, 43 S. Ct. 65, \n260 U.S. 178\n, 194. And unjust or absurd consequences are, if possible, to be avoided. Lau Ow Bew v. United States, 12 S. Ct. 517, \n144 U.S. 47\n, 59; Hawaii v. Mankichi, 23 S Ct. 787, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 213.\n The purpose of the Materialmen's Act, which is highly remedial and must be construed liberally, is to provide security for the payment of all persons who supply labor or material in a public work, that is, to give all creditors a remedy on the bond of the contractor, to be enforced within a reasonable time in a single proceeding in which all claimants shall unite. Bryant Co. v. Steam Fitting Co., 35 S. Ct. 108, \n235 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 59 S. L. Ed 253; Illinois Surety Co. v. Davis, 37 S. Ct. 614, \n244 U.S. 376\n, 380. In resolving the ambiguities in its provisions the court must endeavor to give coherence to them in order to accomplish the intention of Congress, and adapt them to fulfill its whole purpose. Bryant Co. v. Steam Fitting Co., supra, 337, 338 (35 S. Ct. 111). In this case it was further stated, as the premise on which the court rested \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 361]\n\u00a0\n the solution of the particular ambiguity there involved, that the Act 'imposes a limitation of time on all claimants, ... beginning to run from the same event,' that is, the performance and final settlement of the contract; and that, just as the creditor who institutes the original suit has one year from the final settlement in which to commence the action, other creditors must file their claims 'within the same limit of time.' A like construction of the Act was also adopted in Pederson v United States, 253 F. 622, 626, 165 C. C. A. 248, and London Indemnity Co. v. Smoot, 287 F. 952, 956, 52 App. D. C. 378. And this we now confirm.\n By the terms of the Act no creditor can institute a suit until after six months from the completion and final settlement of the contract, within which period the United States alone has the right to commence an action. Texas Cement Co. v. McCord, supra, 163 (34 S. Ct. 550); Miller v. Bonding Co., 42 S. Ct. 98, \n257 U.S. 304\n, 307. And if a suit is then instituted by a creditor or creditors, 'only one action shall be brought,' and all shall file their claims in that suit. If therefore, the provision limiting the right of other creditors to file their claims to twelve months after the completion of the work, is to be taken literally, the result would be that where, for any reason, the final settlement of the contract between the United States and the contractor is delayed until more than six months after the completion of the work, as may frequently happen, the only creditors who could recover on the contractor's bond would be those who should succeed in first commencing a suit after the expiration of the six months from the final settlement, since more than a year having then elapsed after the completion of the work, other creditors would be debarred from any recovery whatever, either in the suit thus brought or in any independent action. In such case the bond would be appropriated solely to the payment of the debts due the creditors who instituted the suit; and to \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 362]\n\u00a0\n the extent of any surplus the contractor and his surety would be entirely released from liability.\n It is clear, considering the entire provisions of the Act, that such an anomalous and unreasonable result was not intended, frustrating the plain purpose that the bond should inure to the benefit of all creditors and that all should share pro rata in the recovery. And to give effect to the manifest intention of Congress it must be held that the phrase 'within one year from the completion of the work' was used in reference to the filing of intervening claims in the same sense as the phrase 'within one year after the performance and final settlement of the contract' in reference to the commencement of the original suit; that is to say, not only that the original suit may be commenced within one year after the performance and final settlement of the contract but that other creditors may file their claims in such suit within the same period of time. In other words, as was said in the Bryant Co. Case, there is the same limit of time for the commencement of the suit and for the filing of intervening claims, 'beginning to run from the same event,' namely, the performance and final settlement of the contract; thereby avoiding a race of diligence between creditors and bringing about the equality in the distribution of the avails of the bond among all creditors which Congress obviously intended.\n\n 3. \nWe find no error in the allowance of the amendments to the declaration and petitions, setting up the supplemental contract. Aside from the fact that the defendants did not object to the allowance of these amendments or except to the orders of the court permitting them to be made, they were plainly germane to the causes of action originally alleged; and, as already stated, did not bring in any new causes of action. Their allowance was entirely proper. Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, supra, 222 ( 36 S. Ct. 321).\n\n 4. \nIt is also contended that the judgment of the District Court is void for the reason that it is recited in one of \n\n[270 U.S. 349, 363]\n\u00a0\n the 'bills of exceptions' and in a memorandum subsequently filed by the District Judge, that the case was heard and taken under advisement in April, while the opinion was filed and the judgment entered in August, that is, after the commencement of a new term of court. There was no exception to the judgment on this ground, and no assignment of error in reference to this matter. And even if the statements thus made by the District Judge after the writ of error had issued, could be looked to for the purpose of contradicting a specific recital in the judgment that it was entered on the same day on which the case was heard and argued, the contention is in conflict with the long established practice and immemorial usage of the federal courts in this respect, and entirely wanting in merit.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 33 Stat. 811 (Comp.

Wheat, of San Francisco, Cal., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the constitutional validity of the Auto Stage and Truck Transportation Act of California (Statutes of California 1917, p. 330, c. 213), as construed and applied to plaintiffs in error by the state Supreme Court. The specific challenge is that, as so construed and applied, it takes their property for public use without just compensation, deprives them of their property without due process of law, and denies them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. The act provides for the supervision and regulation of transportation for compensation over public highways by automobiles, auto trucks, etc., by the Railroad Commission. The term 'transportation company' is defined to mean a common carrier for compensation over any public highway between fixed termini or over a regular route. By section 3(a) no corporation or person is permitted to operate any automobile, auto truck, etc., 'for the transportation of persons or property as a common carrier for compensation on any public highway in this state between any fixed termini ... unless a permit has first been secured as herein provided.' Permits are issued upon application by the incorporated city or town, city and county, or county within or through which the applicant intends to operate. By section 4, the Railroad Commission is empowered to supervise \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 590]\n\u00a0\n and regulate such transportation companies, and to fix their rates, fares, charges, classifications, rules, and regulations, and generally, to regulate them in all matters affecting their relationship with the traveling and shipping public. Section 5 requires, in addition to the permit, that the applicant must obtain from the Railroad Commission a certificate declaring that public convenience and necessity require the exercise of such right or privilege, and it provides that the commission may attach to the exercise of the rights granted such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. Operation under a permit without such certificate is prohibited. In 1919, the act was amended (Statutes 1919, c. 280. p. 457), so as to bring under the regulative control of the commission automotive carriers of persons or property operating under private contracts of carriage, and the term 'transportation company' was enlarged so as to include such a carrier. It was further provided that no such transportation company shall operate for compensation over the highways without first having secured from the commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity so to do.\n Plaintiffs in error were engaged under a single private contract in transporting, for signle private contract in transporting, for stipulated compensation, citrus fruit over the were brought before the commission charged with violating the act, for the reason that they has not secured from the commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The commission, while agreeing that plaintiffs in error were, in fact, private carriers, held that they were subject to the provisions of the act and directed them to suspend their operations under their contract unless and until they should secure a certificate that public convenience and necessity required the resumption or continuance thereof. The commission's order was upheld by the state Supreme Court. 240 P. 26. \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 591]\n\u00a0\n On behalf of plaintiffs in error the contention is that, in its application to private carriers, the act has the effect of transforming them into public carriers by legislative fiat. Upon the other side it is said that the sole purpose of the legislation 'is to impress upon such private carriers certain regulations so long as they desire to use the publicly built and owned highways as the chief situs of their business of hauling goods for compensation,' and that 'they are not, and cannot be, forced, directly or indirectly, to become common carriers.'\n It is unnecessary to inquire which view is correct, since the act has been authoritatively construed by the state Supreme Court. That court, while saying that the state was without power, by mere legislative fiat or even by constitutional enactment, to transmute a private carrier into a public carrier, declared that the state had the power to grant or altogether withhold from its citizens the privilege of using its public highways for the purpose of transacting private business thereon, and that therefore the Legislature might grant the right on such conditions as it saw fit to impose. In the light of this general statement of principle, it was held that the effect of the transportation act is to offer a special privilege of using the public highways to the private carrier for compensation upon condition that he shall dedicate his property to the quasi public use of public transportation; that the private carrier is not obliged to submit himself to the condition, but, if he does not, he is not entitled to the privilege of using the highways.\n It is very clear that the act, as thus applied, is in no real sense a regulation of the use of the public highways. It is a regulation of the business of those who are engaged in using them. Its primary purpose evidently is to protect the business of those who are common carriers in fact by controlling competitive conditions. Protection or conservation of the highways is not involved. This, in effect, \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 592]\n\u00a0\n is the view of the court below plainly expressed. 240 P. 26.\n Thus, it will be seen that, under the act as construed by the state court, whose construction is binding upon us, a private carrier may avail himself of the use of the highways only upon condition that he dedicate his property to the business of public transportation and subject himself to all the duties and burdens imposed by the act upon common carriers. In other words, the case presented is not that of a private carrier, who, in order to have the privilege of using the highways, is required merely to secure a certificate of public convenience and become subject to regulations appropriate to that kind of a carrier, but it is that of a private carrier, who, in order to enjoy the use of the highways, must submit to the condition of becoming a common carrier and of being regulated as such by the Railroad Commission. The certificate of public convenience, required by section 5, is exacted of a common carrier, and is purely incidental to that status. The requirement does not apply to a private carrier qua private carrier, but to him only in his imposed statutory character of common carrier. Apart from that signification, so far as he is concerned, it does not exist.\n That, consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a private carrier cannot be converted against his will into a common carrier by mere legislative command, is a rule not open to doubt, and is not brought into question here. It was expressly so decided in Michigan Commission v. Duke, \n266 U.S. 570\n, 577,578, 45 v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 577\n, 578 S., 45 also, Hissem v. Guran, 112 Ohio St. 59, 146 N. E. 808; State v. Nelson, 65 Utah, 457, 462, 238 P. 237. The naked question which we have to determine, therefore, is whether the state may bring about the same result by imposing the unconstitutional requirement as a condition precedent to the enjoyment of a privilege, which, without so deciding, we shall assume to be within the power of the state altogether to \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 593]\n\u00a0\n withhold if it sees fit to do so. Upon the answer to this question, the constitutionality of the statute now under review will depend.\n There is involved in the inquiry not a single power, but two distinct powers. One of these, the power to prohibit the use of the public highways in proper cases, the state possesses; and the other, the power to compel a private carrier to assume against his will the duties and burdens of a common carrier, the state does not possess. It is clear that any attempt to exert the latter, separately and substantively, must fall before the partamount authority of the Constitution. May it stand in the conditional form in which it is here made? If so, constitutional guaranties, so carefully safeguarded against direct assault, are open to destruction by the indirect, but no less effective, process of requiring a surrender, which, though in form voluntary, in fact lacks none of the elements of compulsion. Having regard to form alone, the act here is an offer to the private carrier of a privilege, which the state may grant or deny, upon a condition which the carrier is free to accept or reject. In reality, the carrier is given no choice, except a choice between the rock and the whirlpool-an option to forego a privilege which may be vital to his livelihood or submit to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable burden.\n It would be a palpable incongruity to strike down an act of state legislation which, by words of express divestment, seeks to strip the citizen of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but to uphold an act by which the same result is accomplished under the guise of a surrender of a right in exchange for a valuable privilege which the state threatens otherwise to withhold. It is not necessary to challenge the proposition that, as a general rule, the state, having power to deny a privilege altogether, may grant it upon such conditions as it sees fit to impose. But the power of the state in that respect is not \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 594]\n\u00a0\n unlimited, and one of the limitations is that it may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights. If the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as a condition of its favor, it may, in like manner, compel a surrender of all. It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.\n The prior decisions of this court amply justify this conclusion. In Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 181, the rule was stated to be that the state, having the power to exclude foreign corporations from its limits, may admit them upon such terms and conditions as the state may think proper to impose. But in Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 456, it was said that this sweeping language must be understood with reference to the facts of that case; and that it could not be extended to include conditions repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. In Barron v. Burnside, \n121 \nU.S. 186, 197\n, 7 S. Ct. 931, this limitation was expressly reaffirmed. Mr. Justice Blatchford, speaking for the court, said (page 200 (7 S. Ct. 936)):\n'The question as to the right of a state to impose upon a corporation engaged in interstate commerce the duty of obtaining a permit from the state, as a condition of its right to carry on such commerce, is a question which it is not necessary to decide in this case. In all the cases in which this court has considered the subject of the granting by a state to a foreign corporation of its consent to the transaction of business in the state, it has uniformly asserted that no conditions can be imposed by the state which are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. La Fayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407 (15 L. Ed. 451); Ducat v. Chicago, 10 Wall. 410, 415 (19 L. Ed. 972); Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 456 ( 22 L. Ed. 365); St. Clair v. Cox, \n106 U.S. 350\n, 356 (1 S. Ct. 354); Phila. Fire Ass'n v. New York, \n119 U.S. 110\n, 120 (7 S. Ct. 108).'\n\n In Southern Pacific Co. V. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 207\n, 13 S. Ct. 44, there was under consideration a Texas statute re- \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 595]\n\u00a0\n quiring a foreign corporation desiring to do business in the state to agree that it would not remove any suit from a court of the state into the Circuit Court of the United States. This court held the statute invalid, saying:\n'But that statute, requiring the corporation, as a condition precedent to obtaining a permit to do business within the state, to surrender a right and privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, was unconstitutional and void, and could give no validity or effect to any agreement or action of the Corporation in obedience to its provisions.'\n\n After the Denton Case came Security Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 \nU.S. 246\n, 26 S. Ct. 619, 6 Ann. Cas. 317. That decision purported to follow the case of Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co., \n94 U.S. 535\n, and to differentiate Barron v. Burnside, supra, and it was thought to have materially modified the rule laid down in the Morse, Burnside, and Denton Cases. But, however this may be, both the Prewitt and Doyle Cases have been quite recently overruled, and the views of the minority therein expressed declared to be now the law of this court. Terral v. Burke Constr. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529, 533\n, 42 S. Ct. 188, 21 A. L. R. 186. In the light of this declaration, these dissenting views become pertinent and controlling. In the Doyle Case, Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the minority, said (pages 543, 544):\n'Though a state may have the power, if it sees fit to subject its citizens to the inconvenience, of prohibiting all foreign corporations from transacting business within its jurisdiction, it has no power to impose unconstitutional conditions upon their doing so. Total prohibition may produce suffering, and may manifest a spirit of unfriendliness towards sister states; but prohibition, except upon conditions derogatory to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States, is mischievous, and productive of hostility and disloyalty to the general government. If a \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 596]\n\u00a0\n state is unwise enough to legislate the one, it has no constitutional power to legislate the other. ...\n\n'The whole thing, however free from intentional disloyalty, is derogatory to that mutual comity and respect which ought to prevail between the state and general governments, and ought to meet the condemnation of the courts whenever brought within their proper cognizance.'\n\n\n In the Prewitt Case, Mr. Justice Day, dissenting, said (pages 267-269 ( 26 S. Ct. 628)):\n'In the opinion of the court in this case the doctrine that a corporation cannot be permitted to be deprived of its right to do business because of the assertion of a federal right is said not to be denied, because the right of a foreign corporation to do business in a state is not secured or guaranteed by the federal Constitution. Conceding the soundness of this general proposition, it by no means follows that a foreign corporation may be excluded solely because it exercises a right secured by the federal Constitution. For, conceding the right of a state to exclude foreign corporations, we must no overlook the limitation upon that right, now equally well settled in the jurisprudence of this court, that the right to do business cannot be made to depend upon the surrender of a right created and guaranteed by the federal Constitution. If this were otherwise, the state would be permitted to destroy a right created and protected by the federal Constitution under the guise of exercising a privilege belonging to the state, and as we have pointed out, the state might thus deprive business within its borders, except upon the condition that it strip itself of the protection given it by the federal Constitution. * *\n\n'While we concede the right of a state to exclude foreign corporations from doing business within its borders for reasons not destructive of federal rights, we deny that the right can be made to depend upon the sur- \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 597]\n\u00a0\n render of the protection of the federal Constitution, which secures to alien citizens the right to resort to the courts of the United States.\n\n'In the cases decided in this court subsequently to Barron v. Burnside, while the general proposition is affirmed that a state may prescribe conditions upon which a foreign corporation may do business within its borders, in no one of them is it asserted that the state may exclude or expel such corporations because they insist upon the exercise of a right created by the federal Constitution. On the contrary, this court has repeatedly said that such right of exclusion was qualified by the superior right of all citizens to enjoy the protection of the federal Constitution.'\n\n In Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 34-48, 30 S. Ct. 190, upon a full review of the prior decisions, the principles set forth in the foregoing quotations was again reaffirmed. That case involved the validity of a Kansas statute which provided that a corporation of another state, though engaged in interstate business, must, as a condition of doing local business, pay to the state certain graduated percentages of its capital stock. It was held that this requirement operated as a burden on the interstate business of the company, in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution, as well as a tax on its property beyond the limits of the state, in violation of the due process of law clause; that thus it was violative of the constitutional rights of the company; and that the right of the company to continue to do business in Kansas was not and could not be affected by the condition. The general principle was again announced in the following words (pages 47, 48 ( 30 S. Ct. 206)):\n'The right of the telegraph company to continue the transaction of local business in Kansas could not be made to depend upon its submission to a condition prescribed by that state, which was hostile both to the letter and spirit \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 598]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution. The company was not bound, under any circumstances, to surrender its constitutional exemption from state taxation, direct or indirect, in respect of its interstate business and its property outside of the state, any more than it would have been bound to surrender any other right secured by the national Constitution.'\n\n Since that decision, the same principle has been reiterated many times and never departed from. Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56, 63\n, 30 S. Ct. 232; International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91\n, 30 S. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103; Herndon v. Chi., R. I. & Pac. Ry., \n218 \nU.S. 135, 158\n, 30 S. Ct. 633; Harrison v. St. L. & San Francisco R. R., \n232 \nU.S. 318, 332\n, 34 S. Ct. 333, L. R. A. 1917F, 1187; Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 187\n, 38 S. Ct. 85; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135, 142\n, 143 S., 38 S. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; Public Utility Commrs. v. Ynchausti & Co., \n251 \nU.S. 401, 404\n, 40 S. Ct. 277; Terrall v. Burke Constr. Co., supra; Burnes Nat. Bank v. Duncan, \n265 \nU.S. 17, 24\n, 44 S. Ct. 427; Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Tafoya et al., \n270 \nU.S. 426\n, 46 S. Ct. 331 (decided March 15, 1926).\n And the principle, that a state is without power to impose an unconstitutional requirement as a condition for granting a privilege, is broader than the applications thus far made of it. In Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, supra, two telegraph companies were engaged in transmitting the quotations of the New York Stock Exchange among the states. This was held to be interstate commerce, and an order of the public Service commission of Massachusetts, requiring the companies to remove a discrimination, was held to infringe their constitutional rights. One of the grounds upon which the order was defended was that it rested upon the power of the state over the streets which it was necessary for the telegraph to cross. That contention was answered broadly (page 114 (38 S. Ct. 439)):\n'But, if we assume that the plaintiffs in error under their present charters could be excluded from the streets, \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 599]\n\u00a0\n the consequence would not follow. Acts generally lawful may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end (United States v. Reading Co., \n226 \nU.S. 324, 357\n, 33 S. Ct. 90), and a constitutional power cannot be used by way of condition to attain an unconstitutional result (Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S. Ct. 190; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56\n, 30 S. Ct. 232; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 35 S. Ct. 57. The regulation in question is quite as great an interference as a tax of the kind that repeated decisions have held void. It cannot be justified 'under that somewhat ambiguous term of police powers.\"\n\n And, in almost the last expression of this court upon the subject, Burnes Nat. Bank v. Duncan, supra, the rule is none the less broadly but more succinctly stated to be (page 24 (44 S. Ct. 428)):\n'The states cannot use their most characteristic powers to reach unconstitutional results. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n (30 S. Ct. 190); Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n (30 S. Ct. 232); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 U.S. 105\n, 114 (38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278).'\n\n We hold that the act under review, as applied by the court below, violates the rights of plaintiffs in error as guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the privilege of using the public highways of California in the performance of their contract is not and cannot be affected by the unconstitutional condition imposed. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, supra page 48 (30 S. Ct. 190).\n The court below seemed to think that, if the state may not subject the plaintiffs in error to the provisions of the act in respect of common carriers, it will be within the power of any carrier, by the simple device of making private contracts to an unlimited number to secure all the privileges afforded common carriers without assuming any of their duties or obligations. It is enough to say that no such case is presented here, and we are not to be \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 600]\n\u00a0\n understood as challenging the power of the state, or of the Railroad Commission under the present statute, whenever it shall appear that a carrier, posing as a private carrier, is in substance and reality a common carrier, to so declare and regulate his or its operations accordingly.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n The question is whether a state may require all corporations or persons, with immaterial exceptions, who operate automobiles, etc., for the transportation of persons or property over a regular route and between fixed termini on the public highways of the State, for compensation, to obtain a certificate from the Railroad Commission that public necessity and convenience require such operation. A fee has to be paid for this certificate and transportation companies are made subject to the power of the railroad commission to regulate their rates, accounts and service. The provisions on this last point are immaterial here, as the case arises upon an order of the commission under section 5 that the plaintiffs in error desist from transportation of property as above unless and until they obtain the certificate required, and by the terms of the statute every section and claim in it is independent of the validity of all the rest. Section 10. Whatever the Supreme Court of California may have intimated, the only point that is decided, because that was the only question before it, was that the order of the commission should stand.\n This portion of the act is to be considered with reference to the reasons that may have induced the Legislature to pass it, for if a warrant can be found in such reasons they must be presumed to have been the ground. I agree, of course, with the cases cited by my brother SUTHERLAND, to which may be added American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n256 \nU.S. 350, 358\n, 41 S. Ct. 499, that even generally \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 601]\n\u00a0\n lawful acts or conditions may become unlawful when done or imposed to accomplish an unlawful end. But that is only the converse of the proposition that acts in other circumstances unlawful may be justified by the purpose for which they are done. This applies to acts of the Legislature as well as to the doings of private parties. The only valuable significance of the much abused phrase police power is this power of the State to limit what otherwise would be rights having a pecuniary value, when a predominant public interest requires the restraint. The power of the State is limited in its turn by the constitutional guaranties of private rights, and it often is a delicate matter to decide which interest preponderates and how far the State may go without making compensation. The line cannot be drawn by generalities, but successive points in it must be fixed by weighing the particular facts. Extreme cases on the one side and on the other are Edgar A. Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S. Ct. 289, and Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393\n, 43 S. Ct. 158, 28 A. L. R. 1321\n\n\n The point before us seems to me well within the legislative power. We all know what serious problems the automobile has introduced. The difficulties of keeping the streets reasonably clear for travel and for traffic are very great. If a State speaking through its Legislature should think that, in order to make its highways most useful, the business traffic upon them must be controlled, I suppose that no one would doubt that it constitutionally could, as, I presume, most States or cities do, exercise some such control. The only question is how far it can go. I see nothing to prevent its going to the point of requiring a license and bringing the whole business under the control of a railroad commission so far as to determine the number, character and conduct of transportation companies and so to prevent the streets from being made useless and dangerous by the number and lawlessness of those who seek to use them. I see nothing in this act that would \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 602]\n\u00a0\n require private carriers to become common carriers, but if there were such a requirement, it, like the provisions concerning rates and accounts, would not be before us now, since, as I have said, the statute makes every section independent and declares that if valid it shall stand even if all the others fall. As to what is before us, I see no great difference between requiring a certificate and requiring a bond as in Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140\n, 44 S. Ct. 257, and although, as I have said, I do not get much help from general propositions in a case of this sort, I cannot forbear quoting what seems to me applicable here. Distinguishing between activities that may be engaged in as a matter of right and those like the use of the streets that are carried on by government permission, it is said:\n'In the latter case the power to exclude altogether generally includes the lesser power to condition and my justify a degree of regulation not admissible in the former.' \n264 U.S. 145\n (44 S. Ct. 259).\n\n I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n Our primary concern is with the decree below-not with the reasons there advanced to support it. I suppose, if that court had simply approved the action of the Railroad Commission and had said nothing more, there would be little, if any, difficulty here in finding adequate ground for affirmance.\n The questions involved relate solely to matters of intrastate commerce. No complication arises by reason of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Having built and paid for the roads, California certainly has the general power of control. Plaintiffs in error are without constitutional right to appropriate highways to their own business as carriers for hire. And if, in so \n\n[271 U.S. 583, 603]\n\u00a0\n many words, the Legislature had said that no intrastate carriers for hire except public ones shall be permitted to operate over the state roads it would have violated no federal law. So far as the rights of plaintiffs in error are affected, nothing more serious than that has been done.\n The states are now struggling with new and enormously difficult problems incident to the growth of automotive traffic, and we should carefully refrain from interference unless and until there is some real, direct and material infraction of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution.\n I think the decree of the court below should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL AMERICAN TANK CAR CORPORATION v. DAY(1926)\nNo. 162\nArgued: January 21, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sigmund W. David, of Chicago, Ill., and Edwin T. Merrick, of New Orleans, La., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry P. Sneed, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants brought suit in the United States District Court for Eastern Louisiana to enjoin the appellee from collecting, by seizure of appellants' property, a tax assessed against them by the state of Louisiana. From a judgment dismissing the bill the case comes here on direct appeal by reason of the constitutional questions involved. Judicial Code, s 238 (Comp. St. s 1215), before amendment of 1925; Hays v. Port of Seattle, 40 S. Ct. 125, \n251 U.S. 233\n; Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis & S. W. Ry. Co., 39 S. Ct. 237, \n249 U.S. 134\n, 6o L. Ed. 517.\n The tax in question was imposed under section 5 of Act 109 of the Louisiana Laws of 1921. Section 1 of that act imposes a tax, for state purposes, of 5 1\/4 mills on the dollar on all property within the state. Section 5 authorizes the assessment of an additional tax for state purposes of 25 mills on the dollar 'of the assessed value of all rolling stock of nonresident ... corporations, having no domicile in the state of Louisiana, operated over any railroad in the state of Louisiana within or during any year for which such tax is levied. ...' Article 10, s 16, of the Louisiana Constitution, exempts from all local taxation nonresidents paying the 25-mill tax. Appellants do not complain of the 5 1\/4-mill tax assessed against them under section 1; nor do they question the amount or method of computation of the 25-mill tax assessed under section 5; \n\n[270 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n but they object to it on the ground that it violates the Constitution of Louisiana, which requires that 'all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects' (article 10, s 1), and on the ground that, as applied to appellants, it violates the federal Constitution by imposing a burden on interstate commerce, and denies to appellants the equal protection of the laws, in that it discriminates unreasonably between residents of Louisiana or nonresidents domiciled within the state, and nonresidents not so domiciled and engaged in interstate commerce.\n All the appellants are corporations organized in states other than Louisiana and are not domiciled or licensed to do business in that state. All own and operate within the state tank cars, for the transportation of oil, which are used in interstate commerce. Taxes on property within the state of Louisiana, other than state taxes, are assessed where the taxpayer is domiciled, by the several parishes and by municipalities in the parishes, both of which are political subdivisions of the state. In some parishes, local taxes exceed 25 mills, and in others they are less than that amount; but it is asserted by the appellee that the average of all local property taxes is approximately 25 mills.\n The tax in question is authorized by article 10, s 16, of the Louisiana Constitution, which reads as follows:\n'Sec. 16. Rolling stock operated in this state, the owners of which have no domicile therein, shall be assessed by the Louisiana tax commission, and shall be taxed for state purposes only, at a rate not to exceed forty mills on the dollar of assessed value.'\n\n The constitutionality of the 25-mill tax imposed under this section was upheld by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in Union Tank Car Co. v. Day, 101 So. 581, 156 La. 1071, and that case disposes of the objections urged here to the validity of the tax under the state Constitution. \n\n[270 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n It is argued that the 25-mill tax which was imposed on tank cars belonging to the several appellants is a thinly disguised attempt to compel nonresidents doing interstate business in Louisiana to declare a domicile in the state, and that it is therefore an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, within the principle of those cases holding that a state may not require a nonresident to procure a license to do business or to declare a domicile within the state as a condition to engaging in commerce across its boundaries. International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, 30 S. 481, \n217 U.S. 91\n, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, 42 S. Ct. 106, \n257 U.S. 282\n. But it is obvious, from an inspection of the statute, that the tax in question is imposed on property of nonresidents in lieu of the local tax assessed in the several parishes of the state on property of persons or corporations domiciled there, and that the nonresident may either pay the state tax assessed under section 5 or, at his option, by becoming domiciled in a parish, pay instead of it the local taxes assessed within the parish. The effect of section 5 is not to require the nonresident corporation to take out a license to do business within the state, but only to subject its property within the state to state taxation. There being no question as to the amount of the tax or the method of its computation, the taxation of appellants' property within the state can be open to no objection, unless it operates to discriminate in some substantial way between the property of the appellants and the property of residents or domiciled nonresidents. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, 38 S. Ct. 373, \n246 U.S. 450\n. And see Pullman Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 11 S. Ct. 876, \n141 U.S. 18\n.\n We are not concerned with the particular method adopted by Louisiana of allocating the tax between the state and its political subdivisions. That is a matter within the competency of the state Legislature. Columbus Southern Ry. Co. v. Wright, 14 S. Ct. 396, \n151 \nU.S. 470, 475\n, 476 S.. \n\n[270 U.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n The court below found, as did the state Supreme Court in Union Tank Car Co. v. Day, supra, that all local taxes throughout the state, from which appellants are exempted by the Louisiana Constitution, average approximately 25 mills, and that, since the tax assessed under section 5 was substantially the equivalent of the local tax in lieu of which it was assessed, there was no unjust discrimination. Such a classification is not necessarily discriminatory. Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Connecticut, 22 S. Ct. 673, \n185 U.S. 364\n. Where the taxing statute, which is in lieu of a local tax assessed on residents, discloses no purpose to discriminate against nonresident taxpayers, and in substance does not do so, it is not invalid merely because equality in its operation as compared with local taxation has not been attained with mathematical exactness. In determining whether there is a denial of equal protection of the laws by such taxation, we must look to the failure and reasonableness of its purposes and practical operation, rather than to minute differences between its application in practice and the application we must look to the fairness and reasonableness which it is complementary. Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Connecticut, supra. And see State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, 612; Shaffer v. Carter, 40 S. Ct. 221, \n252 U.S. 37\n, 56.\n But appellants challenge the District Court's finding of fact that local taxation throughout the state will average about 25 mills. They insist that the average of local taxation is 21 mills, and that this disparity between the rate of tax assessed on appellants and the local tax on the property of residents is a substantial discrimination establishing the invalidity of the tax. In the absence of a purpose to discriminate disclosed by the legislation itself we are not prepared to say that a 4 mills variation in one year not shown to be a necessary or continuing result of the scheme of taxation adopted would be an unconstitutional discrimina- \n\n[270 U.S. 367, 374]\n\u00a0\n tion; for in such a scheme of complementary tax statutes however fairly devised it would be impossible to provide in advance against occasional inequalities as great as that here complained of.\n The record, however, does not support appellants' contention. It was stipulated by the parties that the total of all state and local taxes on property in some of the parishes exceeds 30 1\/4 mills, the sum of the general state tax of 5 1\/4 mills and the special 25 mills tax on property of nonresidents, and that in other parishes it is less than that amount. The stipulation does not, however, show the amount of the variation in the rate of local taxation nor its average throughout the state. The only evidence on the subject is an extract from the annual report of the Louisiana tax commission, purporting to relate to taxes 'for the parishes.' From the data embodied in this report, appellants make their own calculation that the average rate of all parish and local taxes is 21 mills. It is, however, conceded that municipalities within the parishes have independent power of taxation. In some instances they are exempt from taxation by the parish (Const. La. Art. 14, s 12), and the power of parishes to tax property in incorporated cities and towns for parochial purposes is, in certain instances, limited (Const. La. art. 14, ss 7, 8). It is contended by appellee that appellants' computation does not include in local taxes all the taxes assessed by municipalities within the parishes, except in the case of the parish of Orleans, whose limits coincide with those of the city of New Orleans, and that there the rate exceeds 31 mills, as is shown by the report of the tax commission. It is impossible to say, from an inspection of the extract from the report in evidence, which of these contentions is correct. The report is stated to cover taxes for the parishes, and includes numerous items of parish taxes, but it does \n\n[270 U.S. 367, 375]\n\u00a0\n not show on its face whether all taxes assessed by cities, towns, and villages within the parish are included in the report, and there is nothing in the record which will enable us to ascertain that fact. The appellant has therefore failed to show that the tax is discriminatory, either in principle or in its practical operation, and has laid no foundation for assailing its constitutionality.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL INV. CO. v. NEW YORK CENT. R. CO.(1926)\nNo. 274\nArgued: April 27, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Snyder, Henry, Thomsen, Ford & Seagrave, of Cleveland, Ohio (Mr. Frederick A. Henry, of Cleveland, Ohio, of counsel), for appellant.\n Messrs. West, Lamb & Westenhaver, of Cleveland, Ohio (Mr. S. H. West, of Cleveland, Ohio, of counsel), for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by a minority stockholder against the New York Central Railroad Company \n\n[271 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n to enjoin it from dominating and controlling through stock ownership, certain other railroad companies. There are various prayers in the bill, but all make for the attainment of the object just stated.\n The suit was begun in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio June 20, 1924. Federal jurisdiction was invoked on the grounds that the parties are citizens of different states, the plaintiff a Maine corporation and the defendant a corporation of Ohio and states other than Maine, and that the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States, there being also a showing that the value involved is adequate.\n Shortly described, the bill charges that the defendant was organized pursuant to a consolidation agreement between the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Company the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Company, and nine companies subsidiary to them; that the agreement was made in April, 1914, and carried into effect the following December; that thereby the defendant, besides acquiring the railroad lines of the immediate parties to the agreement, became invested with large amounts of stock in other railroad companies, including the Michigan Central and Big Four, and was thus enabled to dominate and control them and their subsidiaries; that these other companies have railroad lines which are operated in both interstate and intrastate commerce, and many of their lines are parallel and normally and potentially competing; that during the ten years since the agreement became effective the defendant through its ownership of stock in these other companies has dominated and controlled and is now dominating and controlling their properties and business; and that this stock ownership, domination and control is in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. st.  8820-8823, 8827- 8830), of the Clayton Act, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, and of the laws of Ohio and \n\n[271 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n other states, wherein the railroads lie, forbidding a common control, through stock ownership or otherwise, of parallel or competing railroads.\n The defendant moved to dismiss the bill on various grounds, and the court after a hearing on the motion entered a decree of dismissal. Afterwards and in due time the court granted a certificate stating that the dismissal was for want of jurisdiction of the subject-matter and allowed a direct appeal in this Court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), which at that time permitted such an appeal where the jurisdiction of the District Court was in issue, but required the jurisdictional question to be certified and limited the review to the ruling on that question.\n In the bill, as we have shown, the plaintiff attempts with much detail to set forth a continuing violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Act, asserts that this violation unless restrained will be injurious to the plaintiff and other stockholders and prays for relief by injunction. Such a suit is essentially one arising under the laws of the United States, and, as the requisite value is involved, is one of which the District Courts are given jurisdiction. By jurisdiction we mean power to entertain the suit, consider the merits and render a binding decision thereon; and by merits we mean the various elements which enter into or qualify the plaintiff's right to the relief sought. There may be jurisdiction and yet an absence of merits (The Fair v. Kohler Die Co., \n228 \nU.S. 22, 25\n, 33 S. Ct. 410; Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, \n238 \nU.S. 254, 258\n, 35 S. Ct. 788) as where the plaintiff seeks preventive relief against a threatened violation of law of which he has no right to complain, either because it will not injure him or because the right to invoke such relief is lodged exclusively in an agency charged with the duty of representing the public in the matter. Whether a plaintiff seeking such relief has the requisite standing is a question going to the \n\n[271 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n merits, and its determination is an exercise of jurisdiction. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 28, 34\n, 21 S. Ct. 251; Venner v. Great Northern Ry. Co., \n209 \nU.S. 24, 34\n, 28 S. Ct. 328. If it be resolved against him, the appropriate decree is a dismissal for want of merits, not for want of jurisdiction.\n A week or two before entering the decree of dismissal the court considered the motion to dismiss in a carefully prepared memorandum found in the record. What was said in it shows that the court was then of opinion, first, that in view of sections 4 and 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8823, 8829), of sections 7, 8, 11 and 16 of the Clayton Act (Comp. St.  8835g, 8835h, 8835j, 8835o), and of section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 407 of the Transportation Act, c. 91, 41 Stat. 480 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  8567), the plaintiff, as a private litigant, was without capacity or right to maintain the bill in respect of the alleged restraint of interstate commerce, because the right to maintain such a bill against railroad carriers was lodged exclusively in others who are charged with guarding the public interest, and, secondly, that the interstate and intrastate business of the carriers affected are so inextricably interwoven that it would be impossible to award any relief reaching their intrastate business without equally affecting their interstate business, and therefore to permit the plaintiff to maintain the bill in respect of the alleged violation of state laws would be indirectly permitting a private litigant to do what in effect is prohibited by federal law.\n The questions considered in the memorandum pertain to the merits, not to jurisdiction; and if the memorandum were definitive of the grounds on which the court proceeded we should regard the bill as dismissed on the merits. But as the decree was entered a week or two later, and the court expressly certified that the dismissal was for want of jurisdiction of the subject-matter, we have given effect to the certificate, and have examined the question certified. Our conclusion is that the court had \n\n[271 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the subjectmatter, and therefore that the decree of dismissal was put on an untenable ground.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGIRARD TRUST CO. v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 137\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 163, 164]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James Craig Peacock, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1219). The judgment was entered May 19, 1924, and the appeal was allowed July 3, 1924. The judgment dismissed the petition of the plaintiffs upon findings of fact. The Girard Trust Company and the other appellants are trustees of the estate of Alfred F. Moore, deceased.\n Their claims are for interest not paid on refunds of taxes paid them. The proposed income tax upon the moore estate for 1920, as originally returned early in 1921, was $196,202.61. On March 15, 1921, and on June 15, 1921, quarterly payments of the tax, which amounted to $49,050.66, each were paid to the collector. On August 2, 1921, the trustees for the estate filed a claim for the refund of the two installments, aggregating $98,101. 32, already paid, and claim for abatement of the two remaining quarterly installments not yet paid, aggregating the same amount. The claim for abatement was allowed in its entirety, and the claim for the refund in large part. The action of the department began December 9, 1922, in a schedule form, signed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, including an item of overassessments, and marked, 'Approved by the Commissioner of Internal \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 165]\n\u00a0\n Revenue, for transmission to the proper accounting officers for credit and refund.' This was transmitted to the collector of internal revenue for the First district of Pennsylvania to examine the account of the taxpayer, to report back the amount to be refunded and the amount to be credited on taxes due and unpaid. The collector made the report. The Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue confirmed the report and the Commissioner directed the refund January 16, 1923. On February 20, 1923, the trustees received by mail a certificate of overassessment dated February 10, 1923, stating that since $196,202.61 was assessed, whereas $13,663.89 was the correct tax, there had been an overassessment of $182,538.72, and that the amount of this overassessment had been applied as follows:\n Amount abated $98,101.29\n Amount credited 21.41\n Amount refunded 84,416.02\n With this certificate was a check for $84,416.02, the amount of the refund without interest. Since filing the petition in this case the trustees received, under date of October 5, 1923, a check for $4,318.97, interest on the refund and the credit of $21.41 from six months after the filing of the claim for refund to December 9, 1922\n\n\n Moore's estate made return to the collector of internal revenue for excess profits tax for the year 1917 of $108,140.15, and on March 21, 1918, paid to the collector of internal revenue $107,372.36, the amount of the tax less the credit of $767.79 allowed for payment in advance of the time fixed by law, June 15, 1918. Ascertaining that the trustees of a trust estate were not subject to excess profits tax, on August 2, 1921, they filed a claim for refund of the entire tax of $108,140,15. This claim was approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for $107,372.36, on December 9, 1922, under the prescribed schedule form in which this item was marked \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n 'Approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, for transmission to the proper accounting officer for credit and refund.' It was sent to the proper collector of internal revenue who reported it back to the bureau. It was approved by the Assistant Commissioner and the refund was finally approved by the Commissioner, January 16, 1923. On February 7, 1923, the plaintiffs received by mail a certificate of overassessment dated February 6, 1923, for $107,372.36, together with a check for $112,864.53, the difference $5,492.17 being interest on the amount refunded from the date six months after the filing of the claim to December 9, 1922.\n The contentions of the Trustees are that the allowances of interest on the refunds are not sufficient under the statute. Section 250(b) of the Revenue Act of November 23, 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 264, c. 136 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 6336 1\/8 tt), provides:\n'As soon as practicable after the return is filed, the Commissioner shall examine it. If it then appears that the correct amount of the tax is greater of less than that shown in the return, the installments shall be recomputed. If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis of the installments as recomputed, the excess so paid shall be credited against the subsequent installments; and if the amount already paid exceeds the correct amount of the tax, the excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of section 252.'\n\n Section 252 of the above act, 42 Stat. 268 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 6336 1\/8 uu) provides:\n'That if, upon examination of any return ... it appears that an amount of income, war profits or excess profits tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then, notwithstanding the provisions of section 3228 of the Revised Statutes, the amount of the excess shall be credited against any income, war profits or excess profits taxes, or installment thereof, then due from the taxpayer under any other return, and any balance of such excess shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer. ...' \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n Section 1324(a) of the same statute, 42 Stat. 316 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 6371 4\/5 j), contains the provision as to interest as follows:\n\n'That upon the allowance of a claim for the refund of or credit for internal revenue taxes paid, interest shall be allowed and paid upon the total amount of such refund or credit at the rate of one-half of 1 per centum per month to the date of such allowance, as follows: (1) If such amount was paid under a specific protest setting forth in detail the basis of and reasons for such protest, from the time when such tax was paid, or (2) if such amount was not paid under protest but pursuant to an additional assessment, from the time such additional assessment was paid, or (3) if no protest was made and the tax was not paid pursuant to an additional assessment, from six months after the date of filing of such claim for refund or credit. The term 'additional assessment' as used in this section means a further assessment for a tax of the same character previously paid in part.'\n\n The claims made by the trustees, appellants here, are, first, that the government erred in its construction of section 1324, by which it allowed interest, not to the dates of payments of the refunds February 20 and February 7, 1913, but only to the date when the Commissioner approved the schedule finding the amount of the overassessments and transmitted the schedule to the accounting officers December 9, 1922. The interest between December 9, 1922, down to the dates of payment amounts to $2,028.11. The question is whether the words 'to the date of the allowance' mean to the date of the decision of the Commssioner that an overassessment has been made, i. e., to December 9, 1922, to the final approval of the refund by the Commissioner January 16, 1923, or to the date of payment.\n The next claim of the trustees is for $3,889.67, and this turns on the question whether under section 1324 the interest on the refund for the 1920 taxes should be calculated \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n under clause (1) in that section as for a payment made under a specific protest or whether as upon a payment under clause (3) for which no protest was made. The Commissioner held that no sufficient protest had been made and therefore allowed interest, not from the time of payment as provided under clause (1), but from six months after the filing of the claim for refund under clause (3), which made a difference of $3,889.67.\n The third claim of the trustees is for $767.79. This is based on the fact that under the Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 326, c. 63, s 1009, a credit on taxes to be paid in advance, calculated at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum upon the amount so paid from the date of payment to the date fixed by law for payment was allowed and the amount paid was $767.79 less than the amount assessed. The claim for refund was allowed for the amount actually paid, but not for the discount. The trustees now seek to recover the discount.\n The Court of Claims dismissed the petition for all these claims on the authority of Stewart v. Barnes, 14 S. Ct. 849, \n153 U.S. 456\n. The taxpayer in that case had already received and accepted the principal of the amount improperly collected by a collector of internal revenue, and this was an action for the interest. This court held that the taxpayer could not maintain an independent action for interest, for the reason that in such cases interest is considered as damages, does not form the basis of the action, and is only an incident to the recovery of the principal debt. We do not think that it controls this case. The payment of interest in the Stewart Case was not expressly provided for in the act. In this case there is statutory provision for it, and it is analogous to a suit in debt or covenant in which the contract specifically provides for payment of interest on the principal debt. In such cases the authorities all hold that the acceptance of the payment of the principal debt does not preclude a further suit for the interest unpaid. \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n Fake v.

United States, 31 Ct. Cls. 276; Crane v. Craig, 130 N. E. 609, 230 N. Y. 452; Bowen v. Minneapolis, 49 N. W. 683, 47 Minn. 115, 28 Am. St. Rep. 333; Blair v. United States ex rel. Birkenstock, 6 F.(2d) 679, 55 App. D. C. 376.\n We are therefore brought to the merits of the case. First, what is the meaning in section 1324 of the words 'to the date of such allowance' to which interest is to be paid on refunds? The Treasury Department, by its regulations of 1922, construed this provision as follows:\n'A claim for refund or credit is allowed within the meaning of the statute when the Commissioner approves the schedule in whole or in part, for transmission to the proper accounting officer, for credit or refund.'\n\n And this is the holding of the Comptroller General. 1 Decisions Compt. Gen. 411, 412. He says:\n'To compute interest to the date of actual payment would be wholly impracticable from an administrative standpoint, and I have no doubt that this phase of the matter was considered by the Congress in providing that the interest should be allowed to the date of allowance rather than to the date of payment of the claim.'\n\n If Congress had intended that interest should be allowed to the date of the payment, it seems to us it would have said so. Allowance in its ordinary sense does not mean payment, and in the practical administration of the Treasury Department the two things are quite different. The one is a decision by the competent authority that the payment should be made. The other is the actual pay- \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n ment. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is the final judge in the administrative branch of the government to decide that an overassessment has been made and that a refund or credit should be granted, and when he has made that decision finally, he has allowed the claim for the refund or credit of the taxes paid within the meaning of the section.\n It is said that this is a remedial statute and was intended to require the government to recoup the taxpayer unjustly dealt with by paying interest during the whole time the money was detained. That was doubtless its general purpose. But the statute is to be construed in the light of the difficulties of the government bookkeeping and accounting. To have made the interest calculable to the date of actual payment would have led to uncertainty and confusion, as the Comptroller General indicates, and it was doubtless for that reason that Congress qualified its desire to pay interest for the exact time during which the money was detained to a date which was practical from an administrative standpoint. Nor does the fact that pending the carrying out of the direction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to make the refund, he might reverse himself, change the finality of his decision allowing the refund. If he does so, the date fixed as the date of the allowance under the section is changed, of course; but the mere fact that he can reverse a final allowance does not prevent its being a final allowance, any more than, when a court renders a judgment, its ability within the term to set it aside or change it affects its finality, if it is not changed. We think, therefore, that the words 'to the date of such allowance' do not carry interest to be paid on refunds down to the time of payment.\n We cannot concur, however, in the view of the Treasury Department that the date of the allowance of the claim as intended by the statute is the date when the Commissioner first decides that there has been an over- \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 171]\n\u00a0\n assessment and sends upon a proper form his decision to the collector of internal revenue, who made the collection and keeps the account with the taxpayer. The findings and the exhibits show that the course of business is that the collector on receiving from the Commissioner the schedule as to the overassessment, examines his books and reports back to the bureau the amount which should be credited on taxes due and the amount to be refunded, that this is examined by the Assistant Commissioner and then is delivered to the Commissioner, who makes it effective by his approval. Until it reaches him and is approved by him, the refund cannot be paid. This we think is the real date of allowance. Until that time, the exact amount of the refund is not fixed finally by competent authority. This date would seem to be just as certain and convenient from an administrative standpoint as that of the original decision of the Commissioner, and it is certainly more in conformity to the general purpose of Congress to relieve the overassessed taxpayer by paying compensatory interest on money unjustly taken and kept by the Government. We think, therefore, that the trustees are entitled to recover from the government interest on both the refund for the taxes of 1917 and that for those of 1920 from December 9, 1922, to January 16, 1923.\n Second. This second claim turns on the provisos of section 1324 with reference to protests. The trustees attached to their original return of income tax for 1920 the following protest:\n'Note.-Profit was made during the year 1920 upon sales of capital assets as set forth in block C above. This amount of $349,200.85 is included in the total net income and under regulations is returned for tax on Form 1040. As the taxpayer is advised that such sum is not taxable income, under the decision of Brewster v. Walsh-District Court for District of Connecticut made December 16, 1920-the report of the amount of such profit is made and \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 172]\n\u00a0\n tax paid thereon only under protest, and only in compliance with the requirement of the foregoing form and the instructions thereon.'\n\n Both the installments of the income tax paid March 15 and June 15 were paid under this protest. On the 15th of June, however, there was added to the protest the following memorandum:\n'In view of the joint investigation by accountants of both government and trustees now in progress, with the agreed object of correcting certain figures, especially those relating to depreciation, believed to have been erroneously increased, as to the most important item and ignored as to another item, in the 1920 return of said trustees covering the sale of the three capital assets in that return set forth, estimating the total of said profits and the tax payable thereon out of the trust estate.\n\n'Inasmuch as the second quarterly installment of $49,050.60 based upon said estimate is now due, you are hereby notified that the accompanying payment thereof is made without prejudice to the right of said trust estate to be hereafter relieved from or reimbursed for the payment of any tax upon the profits so returned in excess of the total tax, resulting from such final adjustment thereof as may be determined, either by agreement, or by the courts. ...'\n\n The government's contention is that the distinction made in section 1324, by which the interest to be paid on refunded taxes is to date from the payment of the taxes in cases where there is a specific protest setting forth in detail the basis and reasons for such protest, and by which the interest is to be dated only from six months after the date of filing the claim for refund or credit when there is no protest, was intended to favor those who furnished to the collecting officers by way of specific protest a valid basis for a refund of the taxes.\n We agree with this view. To hold otherwise would be to invite a protest on any pretended ground by tax- \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 173]\n\u00a0\n payers in every case of payment, and would make the protest of no value to the Treasury or the collecting officers. A protest is for the purpose of inviting attention of the taxing officers to the illegality of the collection, so that they may take remedial measures at once. But, if protests are based on reasons of no validity, they do not accomplish the public purpose for which they are devised.\n In the present case, the protest was based on a decision of the District Court of Connecticut made December 16, 1920. Brewster v. Walsh, 268 F. 207. That case was reversed in Walsh v. Brewster, 41 S. Ct. 392, \n255 U.S. 536\n, March 28, 1921, or more than two months before the payment of the June 15 installment by the trustees. The statement added under the June 15 installment was merely a recital that an investigation was going on between the government and the trustees, and that, if that turned out to be in excess of the right amount, the payment was without prejudice to the recovery of the excess. This was certainly not a protest for specific reasons, in accordance with the requirement of the statute. For these reasons, we think that no recovery can be had for failure to allow interest for the period of the six months after the date of payment.\n Third. The third item of the recovery here sought is for the $767 of discount allowed by the government upon the amount returned for taxation on the income for 1917 by the trustees on the excess profits tax. The tax assessed was $108,140.15. It was not due until June 15, 1918. Under section 1009 of the Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, 40 Stat. 300, c. 63, it was provided that the Secretary of the Treasury, under rules and regulations prescribed by him, should permit taxpayers liable to income and excess profits taxes to make payments in advance in installments or in whole of an amount not in excess of the estimated taxes which would be due from them, provided that the Secretary of the Treasury, under rules and regulations prescribed by him, might allow credit against such taxes so \n\n[270 U.S. 163, 174]\n\u00a0\n paid in advance of an amount not exceeding three per centum per annum calculated upon the amount so paid from the date of such payment to the date fixed by law for such payment, but that on such credit should be allowed on payments in excess of taxes determined to be due.\n We do not see the basis upon which such recovery can be had. The taxpayer cannot obtain a refund under the other sections quoted except for taxes paid. By reason of his payment earlier than required, he has been permitted to reduce the amount which he actually paid. But there is no provision in the statute for a recovery of anything but what he did pay, or for interest on anything but on what he did pay. We think that, if Congress intended him to recover interest for his accommodation of the government by a premature payment of his taxes illegally collected, it would have made a specific provision for it and have given the Commissioner special authority.\n This disposes of the three claims. The conclusion of the Court of Claims is therefore affirmed in all respects, except as to the interest on the refunds on the taxes illegally collected for the year 1917, and for the year 1920 for the period from the 9th of December, 1922, to January 16, 1923, which the trustees should recover.\n The judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Court of Claims, with directions to enter a judgment in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOLDSMITH v. UNITED STATES BOARD OF TAX APPEALS(1926)\nNo. 320\nArgued: November 30, 1925Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 117, 118]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. Ely Goldsmity, of New York City, pro se.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n H. Ely Goldsmith, a citizen of New York and qualified to practice as a certified public accountant by certificate \n\n[270 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n issued under the laws of that state, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, asking for a writ of mandamus against the United States Board of Tax Appeals, created by the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253, 336, tit. 9, s 900 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 6371 5\/6 b)) to compel the board to enroll him as an attorney, with the right to practice before it, and to enjoin the board from interfering with his appearance before it in behalf of taxpayers whose interests are there being dealt with.\n The petition avers that the board has published rules for admission of persons entitled to practice before it, by which attorneys at law admitted to courts of the United States and the states, and the District of Columbia, as well as certified public accountants duly qualified under the law of any state or the District are made eligible. The applicant is required to make a statement under oath, giving his name, residence, and the time and place of his admission to the bar, or of his qualification as a public accountant, and disclosing whether he has ever been disbarred, or his right to practice as a certified accountant has ever been revoked. The rules further provide that the board may in its discretion deny admission to any applicant, or suspend or disbar any person after admission.\n The petitioner says that pursuant to these rules he made application showing that he was a public accountant of New York duly certified, and that his certificate was unrevoked; that he thereupon filed petitions for taxpayers before the board, but that he was then advised, September 5, 1924, by the board that the question of his admission to practice had been referred to a committee for investigation; that in due course he would be notified whether the committee desired him to appear before it, and of its action in the premises; and that on September 27 he received notice that his application had been received, considered, and denied. It does not appear that he made any further application to the board to be heard \n\n[270 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n upon the question of his admission, but filed his petition for mandamus at once. In his petition, he denies the power of the board to make rules for admission of persons to practice before it.\n Upon the filing of the petition, a judge of the Supreme Court of the District ordered a rule against the board to show cause. The members of the board answered the rule as if they were individual defendants, and set out at considerable length the discharge of the petitioner for improper conduct as examiner of municipal accounts in the office of state comptroller of New York (People ex rel. Goldschmidt v. Travis, 152 N. Y. S. 1058, 167 App. Div. 475; Id., 114 N. E. 1078, 219 N. Y. 589), and the rejection of the petitioner as an applicant for admission to practice in the Department of the Treasury because of improper advice to clients, as grounds upon which the committee and the board had denied his application to practice before it.\n To this answer the petitioner replied consenting to the appearance of individual members of the board as defendants, denying some of the charges made, but averring that they were none of them competent evidence on the issue presented and were merely hearsay, and that the action in New York and in the Treasury Department was due to prejudice against him for doing his duty. To this reply the defendants demurred. Upon the issue thus presented, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition for mandamus.\n The Court of Appeals of the District affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court (4 f.(2d) 422, 55 App. D. C. 229), and the case has been brought here on error under section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1227), as a case in which the construction of a law of the United States is drawn in question.\n The chief issue made between the parties is whether the Board of Tax Appeals has power to adopt rules of practice before it by which it may limit those who appear before it to represent the interest of taxpayers to persons \n\n[270 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n whom the board deem qualified to perform such service and to be of proper character.\n The board is composed of members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, with a chairman appointed by the board. It is charged with the duty of hearing and determining appeals from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on questions of tax assessments for deficiencies in returns of taxpayers. Notice and opportunity of be heard is to be given to the taxpayer. Hearings before the board are to be open to the public. The board may subpoena witnesses, compel the production of papers and documents, and administer oaths. The duty of the board and each of its divisions into which it may be divided is to make a report in writing of its findings of fact and decision in each case. In any subsequent suit in court by the taxpayer to recover amounts paid under its decision, its findings of fact shall be prima facie evidence. It is further provided by the act that 'the proceedings of the board and its divisions shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of evidence and procedure as the board may prescribe.' The last sentence in the title providing for the board is: 'The board shall be an independent agency in the executive branch of the government.'\n We think that the character of the work to be done by the board, the quasi judicial nature of its duties, the magnitude of the interests to be affected by its decisions, all require that those who represent the taxpayers in the hearings should be persons whose qualities as lawyers or accountants will secure proper service to their clients and to help the board in the discharge of its important duties. In most of the executive departments in which interests of individuals as claimants or taxpayers are to be passed on by executive officers or boards, authority is exercised to limit those who act for them as attorneys to persons of proper character and qualification to do so. Not in \n\n[270 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n frequently, statutory provision is made for requiring a list of enrolled attorneys to which a practitioner must be admitted by the executive officer or tribunal. Act July 7, 1884, 23 Stat. 236, 258, c. 334 (Comp. St. s 385); Act July 4, 1884, 23 Stat. 98, 101, c. 181, s 5 (Comp. St. s 684); Act June 10, 1921, 42 Stat. 25, c. 18, s 311 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 400 4\/5 f). In view of these express provisions, it is urged that the absence of such authority in case of the Board of Tax Appeals should indicate that it was not intended by Congress to give it the power. Our view, on the contrary, is that so necessary is the power and so usual is it that the general words by which the board is vested with the authority to prescribe the procedure in accordance with which its business shall be conducted include as part of the procedure rules of practice for the admission of attorneys. It would be a very curious situation if such power did not exist in the Board of Tax Appeals when in the Treasury Department and the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue there is a list of attorneys enrolled for practice in the very cases which are to be appealed to the board.\n Our conclusion in this case is sustained by the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Manning v. French, 21 N. E. 945, 149 Mass. 391, 4 L. R. A. 339. That was a suit for tort against members of the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims for unjustly depriving an attorney of the privilege of practicing before it. The court was given by statute power to make rules for regulating the forms and mode of procedure for the court, and this was held to include the power to make rules for the admission of persons to prosecute claims before the court as agents or attorneys for the claimants. It was pointed out in support of the construction that claimants were not compelled to appear in person to present their claims as the taxpayers are not before the Board of Tax Appeals. The fact that in the Manning Case the body was called a court, and that here the board was an executive tribunal, does not make the decision inapplicable. The Court of Alabama Claims was \n\n[270 U.S. 117, 123]\n\u00a0\n certainly not a United States court under the third article of the Constitution. It was rather a commission to aid the fulfillment of an international award with judicial powers.\n It is next objected that no opportunity was given to the petitioner to be heard in reference to the charges upon which the committee acted in denying him admission to practice. We think that the petitioner having shown by his application that being a citizen of the United States and a certified public accountant under the laws of a state, he was within the class of those entitled to be admitted to practice under the board's rules, he should not have been rejected upon charges of his unfitness without giving him an opportunity by notice for hearing and answer. The rules adopted by the board provide that 'the board may in its discretion deny admission, suspend or disbar any person.' But this must be construed to mean the exercise of a discretion to be exercised after fair investigation, with such a notice, hearing and opportunity to answer for the applicant as would constitute due process. Garfield v. United States, ex rel. Spalding, 32 App. D. C. 153, 158; United States ex rel. Wedderburn v. Bliss, 12 App. D. C. 485; Philips v. Ballinger, 37 App. D. C. 46, 51.\n The petitioner as an applicant for admission to practice was, therefore, entitled to demand from the board the right to be heard on the charges against him upon which the board has denied him admission. But he made no demand of this kind. Instead of doing so, he filed this petition in mandamus in which he asked for a writ to compel the board summarily to enroll him in the list of practitioners, and to enjoin it from interfering with his representing clients before it. He was not entitled to this on his petition. Until he had sought a hearing from the board, and been denied it, he could not appeal to the courts for any remedy and certainly not for mandamus to compell enrollment. Nor was there anything in the \n\n[270 U.S. 117, 124]\n\u00a0\n answer, reply or demurrer which placed him in any more favorable attitude for asking the writ.\n This conclusion leads us to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOLTRA v. WEEKS(1926)\nNo. 718\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 536, 537]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph T. Davis and Douglas W. Robert, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lon O. Hocker, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This was a suit in equity brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, and reaches here from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n Eighth Circuit by certiorari. The general purpose of the bill filed by Edward F. Goltra, petitioner here, was to enjoin the seizure of a fleet of towboats and barges on the Mississippi river which had been held by him as lessee. It charged that the Secretary of War, the Chief of Engineers, and Col. T. Q. Ashburn, Chief Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service, were engaged in a conspiracy unlawfully to deprive him of the boats. He sought to enjoin the threatened seizure of them and to have those of them which had already been taken restored to his possession.\n The lease to Goltra was made May 28, 1919, by Gen. Black, Chief of Engineers, as the lessor, by direction of the Secretary of War, acting for the United States. It leased 19 barges, nearing completion, and 3 or 4 towboats, not yet constructed, for a term of five years from the date the first towboat or barge was delivered to the lessee. The lessee covenanted to operate as a common carrier the whole fleet on the Mississippi river and its tributaries for the period of the lease and of any renewals thereof, transporting iron ore, coal, and other commodities at rates not in excess of the prevailing rail tariffs, and at not less than the prevailing rail tariffs without the consent of the Secretary of War. The lessee was to pay all operating expenses of the fleet, and to maintain during the term each towboat and barge of the fleet in good operating condition, to the satisfaction of the lessor. The salvage earned by any of the fleet was to be for the benefit of the United States, after deducting expenses. The net earnings above operating expenses and maintenance for each ton of cargo were to be turned over by the lessee to the Secretary of War every 90 days, for deposit to his credit in the Treasury, until the net earnings equaled the full amount of the cost of the several vessels, plus interest on the cost of 4 per cent. per annum, and \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n then for deposit in St. Louis banks, to be held for the fulfillment of the terms of the lease. The lessee was to keep accurate detailed accounts of all tonnage moved, and all moneys received, and his operating expenses, subject to the inspection of the lessor or his representatives, and the overhead expenses were to be subject to the approval of the lessor, and any items objected to were to be referred to the Secretary of War, whose decision was to be final. Within three months prior to the expiration of the lease, or of any period of renewal, or sooner, if so desired by the lessee, a board was to appraise the value of the fleet, and the lessee was given the option of purchasing the fleet by the fund from the net earnings and by 15 promissory notes running for 15 years, the title of the property to remain in the United States until the payment of the whole of the purchase price of the property.\n Section 8 of the lease, the important provision in this case, reads as follows:\n'The lessor reserves the right to inspect the plant, fleet, and work at any time to see that all the said terms and conditions of this lease are fulfilled, and that the crews and other employees are promptly paid, monthly or oftener; and noncompliance, in his judgment, with any of the terms or conditions, will justify his terminating the lease and returning the plant and said barges and towboats to the lessor, and all moneys in the Treasury or in bank to the credit of the Secretary of War shall be deemed rentals earned by and due to the lessor for the use of said vessels.'\n\n There was a supplemental agreement in 1921, approved by the Secretary of War, made by Lansing H. Beach, the Chief of Engineers, who had then succeeded Chief of Engineers Black. This made provision for the construction of additional facilities for the use of the fleet and brought them within the terms of the original contract.\n The bill set out that there was delay in the construction and delivery of the fleet, and that both parties after \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n the war found difficulty in performing their undertakings; that, after the making of the lease, the plaintiff had secured a good many contracts for the shipment of commodities of different kinds-of oil from New Orleans to Illinois, coal from Kentucky to St. Louis and Manganese from New Orleans to St. Louis; that the rate which he arranged for was 80 per cent. of the prevailing rail rate; that, when he applied to the Secretary of War, he could not obtain permission to transport some of his commodities at a proper rate; that conditions were imposed requiring the consent of officers in charge of the Mississippi Warrior, another enterprise of the government, to Goltra's rate, and that by reason thereof it was impossible for him to operate as a common carrier; that by the acts of the Secretary of War the plaintiff was wrongfully prevented by the lessor from carrying out the terms and conditions of the contract; that John W. Weeks and T. Q. Ashburn, named as defendants, acting in combination, wrongfully undertook to declare the contracts terminated, and on March 3, 1923, demanded from the plaintiff the immediate possession of the boats without warrant of law, and wrongfully and unlawfully threatened to take them by force, caused some of the towboats and barges to be actually seized, and were threatening to take them all, and that unless restrained would do so; that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law for the redress of the wrongs complained of. He therefore asked a temporary restraining order to be granted immediately, and a restoration of the fleet to him, and a rule on the defendants to show cause why a temporary injunction should not issue. A rule to show cause was issued on March 25, 1923, on defendant.\n It appeared that the whole fleet had been taken over by Col. Ashburn under an order of the Secretary of War. The taking over was on Sunday, and there was a purpose on the part of Col. Ashburn, anticipating an \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n injunction, to remove such of the fleet as was in St. Louis across the river, to be out of the jurisdiction of the Missouri District Court. All of the defendants filed returns to the rule, setting out defenses. A hearing was had on the motion for a temporary injunction, evidence was taken, and the District Court found that the fleet had been improperly seized and should be restored to the plaintiffs and the defendants be enjoined from any attempt to resume possession until a final hearing of the case.\n The defendants the sought a writ of prohibition out of this court to prevent the further consideration of the cause by the District Court. Ex parte United States, \n263 \nU.S. 389\n, 44 S. Ct. 130. The leave to file a petition for prohibition was denied, on the ground that the remedy by appeal from the District Court was adequate.\n The evidence shows that in March, 1921, Goltra applied to have his rates as a common carrier fixed at 80 per cent. of the prevailing rail rates, and he was allowed from that time on until March, 1922, to make those rates. In March, 1922, the Secretary of War notified him that he could not approve any operation on the lower Mississippi entering into competition with the government Mississippi Warrior line, and that he could not approve an 80 per cent. rate there. In April, 1922, Goltra objected to the limitation, saying that he had obligated himself to transport coal from Kentucky and managanese and oil from New Orleans at this rate. Thereupon the Secretary of War advised him that the rate on the lower Mississippi must be raised from 80 per cent. to 100 per cent. of the rail tariffs for the future, thus allowing him to complete the contracts of transportation already entered into, of which he had written. By letter of May 25, 1922, he was allowed a rate not less than 80 per cent. of the rail rates for many different commodities. The Secretary assured him that if he decided to operate his boats on \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 543]\n\u00a0\n the upper Mississippi he was authorized to carry all commodities at not less than 80 per cent., and that the officers of the Warrior Service had been instructed to co-operate with him to the fullest extent in making his fleet a success.\n After a year, on March 13, 1923, the Secretary of War, in view of the little use he had made of the fleet, sent the following notice to Goltra:\n'Pursuant to the right reserved in paragraph supplement thereto dated May 26, 1921, between you and the United States, for the operation as a common carrier of a fleet of 4 towboats and 19 barges, and the erection of unloading facilities, you are hereby notified that in my judgment you have not complied with the terms and conditions of said contract, in that you have failed to operate the said towboats and barges as a common carrier, and in other particulars.\n\n'I therefore declare the said contract and the supplement thereto terminated. You are hereby directed, upon the receipt of this notice, immediately to deliver possession of the said towboats and barges, and any unloading facilities erected pursuant to the supplemental contract, and paid for by funds of the United States, to Col. T. Q. Ashburn, Chief Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service, who will deliver this notice, and who is instructed and authorized to receive and receipt for the property herein mentioned.'\n\n April 27, 1923, the Chief of Engineers sent a similar letter to Goltra. Goltra acknowledged receipt of the Secretary's letter, but protested against the action.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the action of the District Court in restoring the fleet to Goltra and enjoining the defendants, and held that the motion to dismiss and to quash the temporary restraining order should have been granted, on the ground that the United States was a necessary party and could not be sued in such an action.\n We cannot agree with the Curcit\n\n\n[271 U.S. 536, 544]\n\u00a0\n We cannot agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the United States was a necessary party to the bill. The bill was suitably framed to secure the relief from an alleged conspiracy of the defendants without lawful right to take away from the plaintiff the boats of which by lease or charter he alleged that he had acquired the lawful possession and enjoyment for a term of five years. He was seeking equitable aid to avoid a threatened trespass upon that property by persons who were government officers. If it was a trespass, then the officers of the government should be restrained whether they professed to be acting for the government or not. Neither they nor the government which they represent could trespass upon the property of another, and it is well settled that they may be stayed in their unlawful proceeding by a court of competent jurisdiction, even though the United States for whom they may profess to act is not a party and can not be made one. By reason of their illegality, their acts or threatened acts are personal and derive no official justification from their doing them in asserted agency for the government. The point is fully covered by Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605\n, 32 S. Ct. 340. In that case, the complainant owned an island in the Ohio river around which the duly authorized officers of Pennsylvania had located a harbor line, which by statute was declared to be forever firm and stable. The Secretary of War changed the harbor lines in such a way as to cross the complainant's land within the state harbor line which had never been, as complainant alleged, part of the navigable waters of the United States. The bill averred that the Secretary of War proposed to institute criminal prosecutions with heavy penalties against complainant for his proposed erection of buildings on his own land. It was objected on demurrer that this was a suit against the United States and must be dismissed for lack of its presence as a party. This court declined to yield to the contention as a ground \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 545]\n\u00a0\n for dismissing the bill. The ruling is so comprehensive, and refers to so many authorities, and is so apt, that we quote the language at pages 619 and 620 (32 S. Ct. 344):\n'If the conduct of the defendant, constitutes an unwarrantable interference with property of the complainant, its resort to equity for protection is not to be defeated upon the ground that the suit is one against the United States. The exemption of the United States from suit does not protect its officers from personal liability to persons whose rights of property they have wrongfully invaded. Little v. Barreme, 2 Cranch, 170 (2 L. Ed. 243); United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 220\n, 221 S. (1 S. Ct. 240); Belknap v. Schild, \n161 U.S. 10\n, 18 (16 S. Ct. 443); Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 U.S. 204\n (17 S. Ct. 770); Scranton v. Wheeler, \n179 U.S. 141\n, 152 (21 S. Ct. 48). And in case of an injury threatened by his illegal action, the officer cannot claim immunity from injunction process. The principle has frequently been applied with respect to state officers seeking to enforce unconstitutional enactments. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 843, 868 (6 L. Ed. 204); Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203 (21 L. Ed. 447); Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 U.S. 1\n, 10 (11 S. Ct. 699); Scott v. Donald, \n165 U.S. 107\n, 112 (17 S. Ct. 262); Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n (18 S. Ct. 418); Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 159\n, 160 S. (28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764); Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n216 \nU.S. 146\n, 30 S. Ct. 280; Herndon v. C., R. I. & P. Ry. Co., \n218 U.S. 135\n, 155 (30 S. Ct. 633); Hopkins v. Clemson College, \n221 U.S. 636\n, 643-645 (31 S. Ct. 654, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 243). And it is equally applicable to a federal officer acting in excess of his authority, or under an authority not validly conferred. Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172 S. (13 S. Ct. 271); (American) School of Margnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n (23 S. Ct. 33).\n\n'The complainant did not ask the court to interfere with the official discretion of the Secretary of War, but challenged his authority to do the things of which complaint was made. The suit rests upon the charge of abuse of power, and its merits must be determined accordingly; it is not a suit against the United States.' \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 546]\n\u00a0\n It is sought to avoid the application of this to the present case by reference to the later case of Wells v. Roper, \n246 U.S. 335\n (38 S. Ct. 317). We think it clearly distinguishable. Wells had a contract with the Postmaster General, acting for the United States, by which Roper agreed for four years to furnish, for use in collecting and delivering the mail, automobiles and chauffeurs at a stipulated compensation. On provision of the contract was that any or all of the equipments contracted for might be discountinued at any time upon 90 days' notice by the Postmaster General. Later Congress authorized that offical in his discretion to use an appropriation to buy and maintain automobiles for operating an experimental combined screen wagon and city collection and delivery service, and in order to do this he deemed it necessary to discontinue the service of the plaintiff, and gave the latter seasonable notice of the cancellation of the contract. The suit was a bill in equity to enjoin the Postmaster General from annulling the contract and interfering between the United States and the plaintiff in the performance and execution of the contract. The bill was dismissed on the ground that it was a suit against the United States. That which the bill sought to restrain was not a trespass upon the property of the plaintiff. The automobiles of the plaintiff were not to be taken away from him by the government officer. What the officer was doing was merely exercising the authority intrusted to him by law for the benefit of the government in annulling a contract which involved no change of possession or title to property. To enjoin the officers' action was in effect enforcement by specific performance of a contract against the United States. It was an affirmative remedy sought against the government, which though in form merely restrictive of an officer was really mandatory against the sovereign. The difference between an injunction against the illegal seizure of property lawfully possessed and against the cancellation of a contract which involved no change of possession is manifest. \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 547]\n\u00a0\n As the United States was not a necessary party to the bill, the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in dismissing the bill and quashing the injunction for lack of its presence as such cannot be sustained.\n\n Coming now to the merits, however, we think that the District Court erred in granting the temporary injunction because on the facts disclosed the lease was finally terminated by the decision of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers, communicated to Goltra under section 8 of the contract. It is very clear that under that section, Goltra agreed that the lease should be terminated and that the plant and barges returned to the lessor, if the lessor decided that in his judgment there had been noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the lease. It appears from the evidence that during the season from July 15, 1922, when Goltra got the boats, they were not in use, but were tied up, except for the transportation of two comparatively small cargoes. The bill itself admits that Goltra did not fulfill his covenant to operate as a common carrier. He says he was prevented from doing so by the Secretary's refusal to give him the rates he wished. The contract expressly forbade rates exceeding the prevailing rail rates and forbade rates less than the rail rates except by consent of the Secretary.\n The stipulation that the lessor, the Chief of Engineers, could terminate the lease if in his judgment Goltra was not complying with the obligations of the contract, did not require for its exercise that the Chief of Engineers, or the Secretary, should hold a court and have a hearing to determine the question of compliance. Goltra was given a notice, March 4th of the termination. He answered March 8th, but he tendered no facts upon which either the Secretary or the Chief of Engineers could base any different conclusion from that already reached from the failure of Goltra to fulfill his obligations. Both the \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 548]\n\u00a0\n Secretary and the Chief of Engineers were fully advised of what Goltra did and did not do under the contract.\n The cases leave no doubt that such a provision for termination of a contract is valid, unless there is an absence of good faith in the exercise of the judgment. Here nothing of the kind is shown. Such a stipulation may be a harsh one, or an unwise one, but it is valid and binding if entered into. It is often illustrated in government contracts in which the determination of a vital issue under the contract is left to the decision of a government officer. Kihlberg v. United States, \n97 U.S. 398\n; Sweeney v. United States, \n109 \nU.S. 618\n, 3 S. Ct. 344; United States v. Gleason, \n175 \nU.S. 588\n, 20 S. Ct. 228; United States v. Mason & Hangar Co., \n260 \nU.S. 323\n, 43 S. Ct. 128; United States v. Hurley, 182 F. 776, (105 C. C. A. 208 ); Martinsburg R. R. Co. v. March, \n114 \nU.S. 549\n, 5 S. Ct. 1035.\n Nor does the circumstance that as in this case the lessor whose judgment is to prevail is a party to the contract alter the legal result. Of course the Chief Engineer is not the real party in interest. He is a professional expert, as such was designated as lessor, and is really acting only as an agent for the government. But, even if this were a stipulation between private individuals, judgment of one of the parties on such an issue would be in the absence of bad faith conclusive. There are many cases where the contract makes the satisfaction of one of the parties in respect to compliance the condition precedent to fulfillment, and good faith is all that is required to justify rejection of work or product tendered. Some of them present a convincing analogy to the case. In Magee v. Scott & Holston Lumber Co., 78 Minn. 11, 80 N. W. 781, the defendant made a contract with a Duluth tug owner to tow 7,000,000 feet of saw logs to its mill at Duluth from the north shore of Lake Superior. The contract contained a provision that, in case the services should not be satisfactory, the defendant reserved the privilege of terminating the contract at any time. The defendant terminated \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 549]\n\u00a0\n the contract, because of plaintiff's delay. The evidence being clear that the decision was honest, the court directed a verdict and the action was sustained by the Supreme Court.\n Much has been said on behalf of the government with reference to the special power of a government officer to act in such a case and without judicial assistance forcibly to repossess himself of government property, which we might find it difficult to agree with but which it is unnecessary for us to consider. Our conclusion is based on the law as it is administered between private persons. Col. Ashburn took possession without notification to Goltra other than that which had been communicated to him by the Secretary of War terminating the contract, and it is clear from the evidence that Col. Ashburn was anxious to take possession of the property before a writ of injunction could be sued out by Goltra, and that he sought to take the fleet out of the jurisdiction of the court where he feared the injunction. He was not directed to make the seizure by the Secretary of War against the opposition of Goltra, but in such case he was directed to resort to legal proceedings. He stands upon the statement that he took possession without violence and therefore was rightly in possession when the order of the court was served. He took possession, whether he took it violently or not. Concede that he did it with a show of force which was coercive. Concede that it was seizure without process and wrong. But, even so, an injunction looks only to the future. At the hearing it was made plain that Goltra was not entitled to the possession, and the court-one of equity-would not go through the idle form of restoring the property to Goltra by way of correcting the colonel's wrong, and then requiring a redelivery to the lessor.\n As it is, the court has taken over the fleet and given it to Goltra under bond, and the only issue that remains is whether the injunction and the restoration should be \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 550]\n\u00a0\n maintained or the injunction be dissolved and the fleet returned to the lessor.\n On an appeal from a temporary injunction it often happens that where there is a balance of convenience and doubt as to the issue, the status quo under the restraining order and the restoration should be maintained until a final hearing; but in this case, in the court hearing it, the issue was fully treated as if on final hearing. The right of the lessor to take over the fleet under section 8 of the contract, unless there was fraud in the judgment of termination by the Chief of Engineers, the lessor, of which we have found no evidence, is clear. We think, therefore, the injunction should be dissolved, and the fleet restored to the lessor.\n The claim that the petitioner has been deprived of his property without due process of law has no substance as a reason for sustaining the temporary injunction appealed from. He has had and is having due process in this very proceeding and on that issue, the decision must go against him whether the taking possession of the boats by Col. Ashburn was warranted or not.\n If Col. Ashburn committed a breach of the peace, or illegally injured any person in his taking possession, he is responsible to proper authority and to the person injured, but that does not affect the rights of the lessor under this lease, or the vindication of them in this review.\n The reversal of the injunction of the District Court by the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:\n Theoretically, everybody in this land is subject to the law. But of what value is the theory, if performances like those revealed by this record go unrebuked? \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 551]\n\u00a0\n An army officer, having inflated himself into judge and executioner, decided that a fleet of towboats and barges lying in the Mississippi river at St. Louis ought no longer to remain in the custody of a private citizen, who held possession of them under a solemn lease and contract of sale from the United States, and who, in order to make them operative, had expended upon them $40,000 of his own money. Then, waiting until a Sunday arrived, he proceeded to grab the vessels by force and endeavored to run them beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\n Action like that is familiar under autocracies, but the prevalent idea has been that we live under a better system.\n The trial court, after taking an ample indemnifying bond, issued a temporary injunction, requiring that possession of the vessels be restored and remain as before the seizure until the rights of all parties could be properly considered and determined. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this interlocutory order, and from its decree the cause came here by certiorari.\n As a fitting climax to the high-handed measures pursued by the officer, special counsel for the United States appeared at our bar and gravely announced:\n'Where the executive power has pronounced its finding or judgment within its proper sphere of action, a judicial judgment is not necessary to the enforcement of the executive one, for the reason that all the compulsive power of the government is in the executive department and may be exercised by it in execution of its own processes and judgment, just as it is exercised by it in the execution of judicial process and judgment.'\n\n It is easy enough for us to smile at such stuff, but, unfortunately, the evil effects are not dissipated by gentle gestures. There should be condemnation forceful enough to prevent repetition so long as men have eyes to read. \n\n[271 U.S. 536, 552]\n\u00a0\n In the Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sanborn presented a well- considered dissenting opinion and pointed out that the only judicable question before that court was whether or not the order for the injunction and the record disclosed an unlawful, improvident or abusive use of the sound discretion which the trial judge was required to exercise. 7 F.(2d) 838, 851. And see Ex parte United States, \n263 \nU.S. 389\n, 44 S. Ct. 130. He could find no such abuse, and neither can I. The trial court did no more than the circumstances permitted. We should approve its action with commendation of the impelling courage and good sense. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mr. Justice Holmes announced the opinion, the Chief Justice being absent. \n\n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAVES v. STATE OF MINN.(1926)\nNo. 320\nArgued: October 21, 1926Decided: November 22, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 425, 426]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Russell C. Rosenquest, of Minneapolis, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Clifford L. Hilton and James F. Markham, both of St. Paul, Minn., for the State of Minnesota.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves a single question relating to the constitutionality of the Minnesota statute regulating the practice of dentistry. Gen. Laws, 1889, c. 19, and amendments, embodied in Gen. Stats. 1923,  5757-5763.\n This statute prohibits the practice of dentistry by persons who have not been licensed by a board of dental examiners. Every applicant for a license is required to present himself for examination by the board and 'produce his diploma from some dental college of good standing,' of which the board shall be the judge, with satisfactory evidence showing his good moral character. The board shall then give him an examination to test thoroughly his fitness for practice, and, if he successfully passes this, shall register him as a licensed dentist.\n Graves, the plaintiff in error, had applied for a license, but had been refused an examination by the board because he had no diploma from an accredited dental college. He was thereafter prosecuted in a municipal court for violating the statute by practicing dentistry without a license. He asserted his fitness to practice, and interposed a challenge to the constitutional validity of the statute. This was overruled, and he was found guilty and sentenced. The judgment was affirmed by the Su- \n\n[272 U.S. 425, 427]\n\u00a0\n preme Court of the State, 166 Minn. 496, 207 N. W. 560; and the case is brought here by writ of error on the constitutional question.\n The specific contention is that the requirement of the statute that an applicant for a license must present a diploma from an approved dental college before he can be examined by the board-which, in effect, limits the granting of licenses to persons having diplomas from dental colleges of good standing-is unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory, and violates the due process clause and other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n It is well settled that a state may, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, prescribe that only persons possessing the reasonably necessary qualifications of learning and skill shall practice medicine or dentistry. Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114, 122\n, 9 S. Ct. 231; Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165, 167\n, 43 S. Ct. 303. In the Dent Case this Court said:\n'The power of the State to provide for the general welfare of its people authorizes it to prescribe all such regulations as, in its judgment, will secure or tend to secure them against the consequences of ignorance and incapacity as well as of deception and fraud. As one means to this end it has been the practice of different States, from time immemorial, to exact in many pursuits a certain degree of skill and learning upon which the community may confidently rely, their possession being generally ascertained upon an examination of parties by competent persons, or inferred from a certificate to them in the form of a diploma or license from an institution established for instruction on the subjects, scientific and otherwise, with which such pursuits have to deal. The nature and extent of the qualifications required must depend primarily upon the judgment of the State as to their necessity.' Page 122 (9 S. Ct. 233).\n\n In the Douglas Case, which involved the constitutionality of a statute containing similar provisions to those of \n\n[272 U.S. 425, 428]\n\u00a0\n the Minnesota statute, the validity of the provision that only persons having diplomas from a dental college should be eligible to examination for a license to practice dentistry, although not directly involved, was distinctly implied. The specific objection there was that the statute did not state in terms the scope and character of the examination to be made by the board of examiners, and therefore conferred upon it arbitrary power to grant or withhold licenses. But in answering this contention this Court said that the provision that the applicant must be a graduate of a reputable dental school and of good moral character, clearly indicated 'the general standard of fitness and the character and scope of the examination'; and the constitutionality of the statute was sustained. Page 169 (43 S. Ct. 305.)\n By enacting the present statute the State has determined, through its legislative body, that to safeguard properly the public health it is necessary that no one be licensed to practice dentistry who does not hold a diploma from a dental college of good standing. That determination must be given great weight. Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 8 S. Ct. 273. And the case is to be considered in the light of the principle that the State is primarily the judge of regulations required in the interest of public safety and welfare, and its police statutes may only be declared unconstitutional where they are arbitrary or unreasonable attempts to exercise the authority vested in it in the public interest. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Clara City, \n246 \nU.S. 434, 439\n, 38 S. Ct. 346; Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 668\n, 45 S. Ct. 625\n\n\n Clearly the fact that an applicant for a license holds a diploma from a reputable dental college has a direct and substantial relation to his qualification to practice dentistry. We cannot say that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment, it \n\n[272 U.S. 425, 429]\n\u00a0\n determines that the holding of such a diploma is a necessary qualification for the practice of dentistry; or that the distinction made in the granting of licenses between applicants who hold such diplomas and those who do not, is a classification which has no real or substantial basis. And the constitutionality of the statute must be sustained.\n This conclusion is in harmony with the decisions in other state courts involving the constitutional validity of statutes regulating the practice of medicine or dentistry which contain similar or analogous provisions, as well as with the earlier Minnesota decisions. In re Thompson, 36 Wash. 377, 78 P. 899, 2 Ann. Cas. 149; State v. Creditor, 44 Kan. 565, 24 P. 346, 21 Am. St. Rep. 306; State v. Green, 112 Ind. 462, 14 N. E. 352; People v.

And it is not in conflict with the decisions in Smith v. Texas, \n233 \nU.S. 630\n, 34 S. Ct. 681, L. R. A. 1915D, 677, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 420, and State v. Walker, 48 Wash. 8, 92 P. 775, 15 Ann. Cas. 257, on which the plaintiff in error relies, which dealt with statutes attaching unreasonable and arbitrary requirements to the pursuit of the employments or trades of locomotive engineers and barbers. These manifestly involve very different considerations from those relating to such professions as dentistry requiring a high degree of scientific learning.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. GALBEREATH CATTLE CO.(1926)\nNo. 138\nArgued: January 15, 1926Decided: April 19, 1926\n\n\n\n Under Judicial Code,  28, 29 (Comp. St.  1010, 1011), if any ground of petition for removal to federal court is well taken, it is error for state court to deny petition and proceed further with case.\n Whether case is one arising under the laws of United States, as affects right of removal to federal court, is determinable from statement of cause of action in complaint.\n Where cattle were shipped in interstate commerce under bills of lading issued under Carmack Amendment (Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa), and allegedly injured through carrier's unreasonable delay and failure to unload, as required by Act June 29, 1906,  (Comp. St.  8651), held, action for damages was one arising under the laws of the United States, as affected right of removal to federal court, under Judicial Code,  28 ( Comp. St.  1010).\n Action between citizens of different states, within Judicial Code,  24 (Comp. St.  991), was removable to federal court under section 28 ( Comp. St.  1010), though, as matter of venue, action could not have been brought originally in court to which removal was sought. \n\n[271 U.S. 99, 100]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Parker Veazey, Jr., of Great Falls, Mont., for petitioner.\n Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action begun in a state court in Montana to recover for injuries to cattle shipped by railroad in interstate commerce. In due time the defendant presented a verified petition, accompanied by a proper bond with good and sufficient surety, for the removal of the case into the federal District Court for Montana; but the state court denied the petition, accorded the defendant an exception, and proceeded to the disposal of the case on the merits. After a trial it gave judgment for the plaintiffs, which the Supreme Court of the state affirmed after a part of the damages awarded was remitted. 213 P. 610, 66 Mont. 198; 227 P. 65, 71 Mont. 56; Rev. Code Mont. 1921,  9748. The case is here on writ of certiorari.\n One of the rulings assigned for error in the Supreme Court of the state was the denial of the petition for removal; but that court held that the case was not removable and sustained the ruling. It was to review the decision on this point that certiorari was granted. \n\n[271 U.S. 99, 101]\n\u00a0\n The material allegations of the plaintiffs' complaint were to the following effect: One of the plaintiffs is a corporate citizen of Montana and the other is an individual citizen of Wyoming; while the defendant is a corporate citizen of Minnesota. The cattle were shipped from Cody, Wyo., to Seville, Mont., on a through bill of lading over two connecting lines of railroad, the second being owned and operated by the defendant. The plaintiffs owned the cattle, were both consignors and consignees of the shipment, and were the lawful holders of the bill of lading. The cattle were injured while in transit over the defendant's road by the defendant's action in unreasonably delaying and carelessly handling them, and wrongfully omitting to unload them, when necessary, in a humane manner into properly equipped pens for rest, water, and feeding-the resulting damages to the plaintiffs being upwards of $30,000.\n The petition for removal, besides showing the presence of the requisite jurisdictional amount and the defendant's nonresidence in the state where sued, asserted a right of removal on two grounds: First, that the case was one arising under the laws of the United States, particularly those applying to the shipment of cattle by railroad in interstate commerce; and, secondly, that the case was between citizens of different states.\n If either ground was well taken, the case was removable (Judicial Code,  28 (Comp. St.  1010); General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., 43 S. Ct. 106, \n260 U.S. 261\n, 271, et seq.; Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 43 S. Ct. 230, \n260 U.S. 653\n), and the state court erred in denying the petition and proceeding further with the case (Judicial Code,  29 (Comp. St.  1011); New Orleans, Mobile & Texas R. R. Co. v. Mississippi, \n102 U.S. 135\n, 141; National Steamship Co. v. Tugman, 1 S. Ct. 58, \n106 U.S. 118\n, 122.\n Whether the first ground was well taken is to be determined from the plaintiffs' statement in the complaint \n\n[271 U.S. 99, 102]\n\u00a0\n of their cause of action. According to that statement the cause of action was for injuries to cattle resulting from the defendant's negligent and wrongful nonperformance of duties devolving on it as a second and connecting carrier while the cattle were being transported over its road on a through bill of lading, including the duty to unload them for needed rest, water, and feeding. The bill of lading was issued under a law of Congress (Carmack Amendment, c. 3591,  7, 34 Stat. 593, 595 (Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa), and governed the entire transportation-that over the defendant's line as well as that over the line of the initial carrier ( Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Ward, 37 S. Ct. 617, \n244 U.S. 383\n, 387). And the carriers' duties in respect of unloading the cattle 'in a humane manner into properly equipped pens for rest, water and feeding' were prescribed by a law of Congress (chapter 3594, 34 Stat. 607 ( Comp. St.  8651)). So it is apparent that the case stated in the complaint was one arising under the laws of the United States. Cincinnati, etc., Ry. Co. v. Rankin, 36 S. Ct. 555, \n241 U.S. 319\n, 326, L. R. A. 1917A, 265; St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co. v. Starbird, 37 S. Ct. 462, \n243 U.S. 592\n, 595; Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, 38 S. Ct. 130, \n245 U.S. 359\n; Id., 38 S. Ct. 203, \n245 U.S. 562\n; same case, 39 S. Ct. 138, \n248 U.S. 446\n. And see Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 30 S. Ct. 184, \n215 U.S. 501\n, 507.\n It also is apparent, from the complaint and the petition for removal, that the case was one between citizens of different states in the sense of the statute defining the general jurisdiction of the federal District Courts. Judicial Code,  24 (Comp. St.  991). The words of that statute are:\n'Shall have original jurisdiction ... of all suits of a civil nature ... where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interests and costs, the sum or value of three thousand dollars, and ... is between citizens of different states.'\n\n This was such a case. The amount in controversy exceeded the requirement, and the plaintiffs were citizens of states other than the one of which the defendant was a citizen. Sweeney v. Carter Oil Co., 26 S. Ct. 55, \n199 U.S. 252\n, 256. \n\n[271 U.S. 99, 103]\n\u00a0\n And as the case was begun in a court of a state of which the defendant was a nonresident, it came plainly within the provision for the removal of cases on the ground of diverse citizenship. Judical Code,  28. In concluding otherwise the state cours conceived that they were following Smith v. Lyon, 10 S. Ct. 303, \n133 U.S. 315\n, and Camp v. Gress, 39 S. Ct. 478, \n250 U.S. 308\n. But they misapprehended the question involved in theose cases. Both were begun in a federal court, and both were recognized as falling within the general jurisdiction of those courts. The question in each was one of venue- whether the case could be maintained in the court of a particular district against the defendant's objection. That question was answered in the negative. In Camp v. Gress the court was careful to point out the difference in purpose and operation between the statutory provision defining the general jurisdiction of the federal District Courts and the provision dealing with venue. And in General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., supra, and Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., supra, this court again pointed out that difference, and also that the venue provision respecting suits begun in those courts has no application to suits removed into them from state courts. The difference between the original removal statute of 1789 (chapter 20,  12, 1 Stat. 79), to which the state courts gave some attention, and the present statute was shown in the last paragraph of the opinion in Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., supra, and does not call for further comment here.\n We are of opinion that the state court of first instance should have given effect to the petition for removal, and had declined to proceed further in the case, and that the appellate court should have reversed the judgment, with a direction that that be done.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. REED(1926)\nNo. 57\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 539, 540]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. G. Dorety, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. E. V. KuyKendall, of Olympia, Wash., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 539, 541]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in a state court in Whatcom county, Wash., against the Great Northern Railway Company to have it declared a trustee for the plaintiff of the title to a quarter-quarter section of land, theretofore patented to it by the United States, and to compel a conveyance in discharge of the trust. The company in its answer denied much that was alleged in the complaint and sought a decree quieting the title. On the trial the plaintiff prevalied, and the Supreme Court of the state affirmed the decree. Reed v. Great Northern R. Co., 218 P. 210, 222 P. 901, 126 Wash. 312.\n The suit involved a conflict between a railroad lieu selection and an asserted homestead settlement. The evidence on the material issues was so direct and free from contradiction that the real controversy was over the application of federal statutes to facts conceded or definitely established.\n The Great Northern Railway Company is the successor in interest of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company, which constructed and put in operation certain lines of railroad in the state of Minnesota and the territory of Dakota, and thereby became entitled under an early land grant by Congress to particular lands along those lines. The land officers of the United States denied the company's right to the lands along the lines in Dakota, and treated those lands as open to settlement, entry, and disposal under the public land laws. In 1890 this court pronounced the action of the land officers erroneous, and sustained the right of the railway company to the Dakota lands. St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Phelps, 11 S. Ct. 168, \n137 U.S. 528\n. In the meantime many of the lands had come to be occupied and improved by persons who had made entries or purchases of them as public lands under the ruling of the \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 542]\n\u00a0\n land officers. To correct the resulting wrong to both the company and the individual claimants, Congress by the Act of August 5, 1892, c. 382, 27 Stat. 390, requested the company to relinquish its right to such lands, to the end that the United States might invest the individual claimants with a good title, and declared that the company, on executing the relinquishment, should be entitled to select and receive other lands in equal quantity. The company complied with that request, and thus became entitled as matter of legal right, and not of grace, to select and receive other lands conformably to the terms of the act. Shortly described, the act (section 2) provided that the selections might be made within any of the states 'into or through which the railway owned by said railway company runs'-Washington being one-from the nonmineral, unreserved public lands therein, 'to which no adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been initiated at the time of the making of such selection'; that not exceeding 640 acres should be selected in a single body; that the mode of selection should be by filing descriptive lists in the land offices for the districts where the selected tracts lay and paying the usual fees of the local land officers; that selection might be made of tracts while yet unsurveyed, in which event they should be described in the list with a reasonable degree of certainty,1 and should be designated according to the survey in a supplemental list within three months after the plat of the survey was filed in the local office; and that on the approval of any list by the Secretary of the Interior2 the tracts selected therein should be patented to the company. \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 543]\n\u00a0\n The railway company selected the quarterquarter in question May 5, 1902, while it was unsurveyed, by filing a suitable list in the proper local land office and paying the officers' fees, and it duly supplemented that list by another designating the tract according to the survey within a few days after the plat of the survey was filed in the local office, which was on February 6, 1907. The lists were transmitted by the local officers to the General Land Office and laid before the Secretary of the Interior. He approved them, and on April 13, 1908, a patent was issued to the company.\n The tract was open to selection and was duly selected and rightly patented, if at the time of the selection-May 5, 1902-a homestead claim to the land had not been initiated by the acts about to be stated. The plaintiff contended that such a claim had been initiated, and the courts below so held.\n In September or October, 1901, W. J. Tincker, who possessed the qualifications named in the homestead law, went to the quarter section which includes this quarter-quarter, blazed a line around the larger tract, and posted notices at its four corners declaring that he claimed it as a homestead. He was there on that occasion two or three hours. In March,3 1902, he went to the quarter section again, blazed a trial from an adjacent stream to the nearest corner, cut a few poles, and with these laid what appeared to be a cabin foundation two or three poles high. The trial did not touch the quarter-quarter here in question, nor was the pole foundation placed on it. Tincker was there on that occasion for a longer time than before, probably the greater part of a working day. That is all that was done by him prior to the company's selection. Thereafter he went to the quarter section once \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 544]\n\u00a0\n or twice a year, usually on hunting trips, but did nothing there beyond renewing his notices at the corners. In August, 1906, he sold his so- called possessory claim and improvements. When he first went to the land, and continuously to the time he sold, he was residing, with his wife and children, at Maple Falls, a few miles from the land, and was maintaining a home there. At the trial he was a witness for the plaintiff, and testified that his intention throughout that period was 'to hold' the quarter section, 'expecting some day to go up there and live on it.'\n Tincker sold to W. M. Smithey, who three months later sold to the plaintiff. The last was the only one of the three who made any attempt at establishing a residence on the quarter section. In November, 1906, he did establish a residence on a part of it not here in question, and after the survey he sought and secured a homestead entry on that part at the local land office. He also sought to have the part here in question included in that entry, but failed. 41 L. D. 375. He had no right to have it included unless Tincker's acts prior to the company's selection amounted to the initiation of a homestead claim and thereby excepted the tract from the class of lands open to selection.\n In the company's selection list and supporting affidavit nothing was said about Tincker's acts, not improbably because the selecting agent knew nothing about them, and found nothing on or in the vicinity of the quarter- quarter indicative of a homestead settlement or occupancy. When the plaintiff, in 1907, applied to make his homestead entry and to include this quarter-quarter therein, he based his application on his own settlement in November, 1906, and said nothing about a prior claim by Tincker. That was the situation when the patent issued to the company. Afterwards the plaintiff requested that a suit be brought by the United States to cancel the \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 545]\n\u00a0\n patent on the grounds that the company in making its selection had not disclosed Tincker's acts, and that the land officers issued the patent without knowledge of those acts; but the Secretary of the Interior declined to recommend such a suit. The plaintiff brought the present suit in his own right in 1919-11 years after the issue of the patent, during all of which the company had been regularly paying state and county taxes on the tract.\n The homestead law-putting aside special provisions without bearing here-accords to every person of stated qualifications the privilege of acquiring title to a quarter section, or less, of 'unappropriated public lands' by settling thereon and continuously residing on, improving and cultivating the same for a prescribed period. The original law was confined to surveyed lands, and required that the claims be initiated by an entry made at the local land office, which was to be followed within a reasonable time by actual settlement, residence, etc. Act May 20, 1862, c. 75, ss 1, 2, 12 Stat. 392; Rev. Stat. ss 2289, 2290, as amended by Act March 3, 1891, c. 561, s 5, 26 Stat. 1098 (Comp. St. ss 4530, 4531). Afterwards a provision was added permitting claims to be initiated, as respects either surveyed or unsurveyed lands, by settlement, and providing, where that was done, that record entry should be sought within three months after settlement if the land was surveyed, or, if unsurveyed, within a like period after the survey was made and the plat was filed in the local office. Act of May 14, 1880, c. 89, s 3, 21 Stat. 140 (Comp. St. s 4538). The term 'settlement' is used as comprehending acts done on the land by way of establishing or preparing to establish an actual personal residence-going thereon and, with reasonable diligence, arranging to occupy it as a home to the exclusion of one elsewhere. The law makes it plain that there must be a definite purpose 'in good faith to obtain a home' by proceeding 'faithfully and honestly' to comply with 'all the requirements.' And the decisions made and in \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 546]\n\u00a0\n structions issued by the officers charged with its administration show that they uniformly have taken the position that a claim cannot be initiated by asserted acts of settlement which are only colorable and done with a purpose to hold the land for speculation or while maintaining an actual residence elsewhere. \n4\n The instructions say:\n'Settlement is initiated through the personal act of a settler placing improvements on the land or establishing a residence thereon . ... When settlement is made on unsurveyed lands the settler must plainly mark the boundaries of all land claimed. Within a reasonable time after settlement actual residence must be established on the land and continuously maintained.'\n\n The decisions of this court have established the principle that one who, in response to the invitation in the homestead law, actually settles on the public lands in an honest effort to acquire a home should be dealt with leniently and not subjected to the loss of his toil and efforts through any mistake or neglect of the officers or agents of the Government.

But its decisions also show that this salutary rule does not excuse substantial failures to comply with the requirements respecting the initiation of such a claim or accord to it a preference over other claims lawfully acquired and prior in time. Maddox v. Burnham, 15 S. Ct. 448, \n156 U.S. 544\n, 548; Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Amacker, supra; Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, 31 S. Ct. 300, \n219 U.S. 380\n, 387 et seq.; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wass, 31 S. Ct. 321, \n219 U.S. 426\n; Svor v. Morris, 33 S. Ct. 385, \n227 U.S. 524\n, 527; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Houston, 34 S. Ct. 113, \n231 U.S. 181\n.\n The Supreme Court of the state rightly recognized that the plaintiff's claim was initiated long after the company's selection at the local land office, and therefore that the real question was whether Tincker's asserted acts prior to that selection amounted to the initiation of a homestead claim. If they did the tract in dispute was not subject to selection under the act of 1892; otherwise it was. The important words of the act are, public lands 'to which no adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been initiated at the time of the making of such selection.' The Supreme Court of the state held that Tincker's acts 'were not sufficient to initiate a bona fide settlement,' but concluded with some hesitation that they nevertheless took the tract out of the class of lands subject to selection.\n We agree that Tincker did not make a bona fide settlement, and we are further of opinion that his acts fell so far short of such a settlement that they did not amount to the initiation of a claim in any admissible view of the homestead law or the act of 1892. He did nothing indicative of a present purpose to establish a home on the quarter section. He started no real improvements, made no preparations for living there, did not attempt to reside there and did not take his family there, but confined himself to minor acts calculated merely to deter others from \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 548]\n\u00a0\n initiating claims. In the seven or eight months preceding the company's selection he was on the land but twice-less than a day each time. His subsequent conduct, if we turn to it, is equally persuasive that he was without a present purpose to make the place a home. He merely visited it once or twice a year, usually on hunting trips, and on those visits only renewed the notices intended to deter others. Considering what he did and his testimony that he was expecting from his first trip in 1901 to his sale in 1906 that 'some day' he would go there to live, we think it apparent that his asserted settlement, even if not a myth in his own mind, fell pronouncedly short of satisfying the requirements of the homestead law in respect of the initiation of a claim, and so did not except the quarter-quarter in question from the company's right of selection under the act of 1892. He endeavored in his testimony to attribute his omissions to a temporary withdrawal of the land and the surrounding area pending an inquiry as to whether they should be included in an existing forest reserve. But that withdrawal-it later was revoked-could not have been a factor in the matter, because the withdrawal order when produced in evidence disclosed that it was made more than a year after his asserted settlement and more than six months after the company's selection, and that it contained a provision declaring that bona fide settlements and valid claims were not affected by it.\n If, while maintaining a home at Maple Falls, Tincker could initiate a homestead claim by acts such as are disclosed here, and thus hold the land against others desiring to initiate claims, the way was open for him similarly to make a colorable appropriation of many tracts in that timber region, and thus to exact tribute from intending settlers and claimants. His acts, if effective against the company's right of selection, would be equally an obstacle to the initiation of homestead settlement claims, \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 549]\n\u00a0\n which is admissible only in respect of unappropriated public lands.\n The state court regarded its conclusion as deriving some support from cases in this court; but we think the cases cited are not susceptible of that interpretation. All are cases where the individual claim which operated to defeat the railroad claim or selection was prior in time and had been initiated either by an entry at the land office or by an actual bona fide settlement. Kansas Pacific Railway Co. v. Dunmeyer, 5 S. Ct. 566, \n113 U.S. 629\n, and St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Donohue, 28 S. Ct. 600, \n210 U.S. 21\n, are typical of all. In both a homestead claim prior in time was involved. In the first it had been initiated by an entry at the land office, and in the second by actual settlement and occupancy in good faith. In both it was in existence when the right of the railroad company oecame fixed, if fixed at all, and the ruling was that such a claim existing at that time excepted the land-from the company's grant in one case and from its right of lieu selection in the other-and that a subsequent abandonment, relinquishment, or failure to comply with the law on the part of the homestead claimant neither obviated the exception nor entitled the company to the land-under the grant in one case and the selection in the other. We perceive nothing in either case which makes for the view that acts which fall far short of initiating a claim, in either mode, work such an exception.\n The selection in St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Donohue was under the act of 1892, now before us, and was of unsurveyed land. When it was made, a qualified claimant, who had settled theretofore and given notice of the extent of his claim, was residing on, occupying, and improving the land and in good faith conforming to the homestead requirements. Subsequently he died, and his mother as sole heir sold his possessory claim and improvements to Donohue, who made a timber \n\n[270 U.S. 539, 550]\n\u00a0\n and stone entry of the land after the survey. This court, after carefully pointing out that the homestead claim was lawfully initiated, held that the land was excepted from the right of selection, and therefore that the selection was of no avail. Most of the discussion in the opinion was to no purpose if, as is contended here, it was immaterial whether the homestead claim was initiated in substantial conformity to the homestead requirements.\n A selection of unsurveyed land under the same act was involved in Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Hower, 35 S. Ct. 465, \n236 U.S. 702\n, and was sustained against an asserted prior homestead claim on the ground that, while the claimant had put a small barn on the tract and had cut a trail across it prior to the selection, he had never resided thereon, or shown any purpose to do so, but had been maintaining a home on other land, not even contiguous to it.\n The Donohue Case and the Hower Case taken together, illustrate the principle of prior cases, and show how it should be applied here.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See West v.

St. s 1219) before that section was repealed by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, s 13, 43 Stat. 936, 941. The claim is for damages due to delay in enabling the plaintiff to perform a contract. The Court of Claims held that the plaintiff waived any claim that it might have had by going on with the work without protest and without taking any steps to protect itself. 59 Ct. Cl. 593. The government contends that by the terms of the contract it was not bound to pay damages for delay.\n The contract was that the plaintiff should furnish and install heating systems, 'one in the Foundry Building, and one in the Machine Shop at the Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia.' It allowed tow hundred days from the date of delivering a copy to the plaintiff for the work to be completed. A copy was delivered on August 31, 1917, \n\n[270 U.S. 4, 6]\n\u00a0\n making March 19, 1918, the day for completion. But it was obvious on the face of the contract that this date was provisional. The Government reserved the right to make changes and to interrupt the stipulated continuity of the work. Wells Brothers Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 83, 86\n, 41 S. Ct. 34. The contract showed that the specific buildings referred to were in process of construction by contractors who might not keep up to time. 'The approximate contract date of completion for the foundry' is stated to be March 17, 1918, and that for the machine shop, February 15, 1918. The same dates were fixed for completing the heating systems, but the heating apparatus had to conform to the structure, of course, so that if the general contractors were behindhand the heating also would be delayed. They were behindhand nearly a year. When such a situation was displayed by the contract it was not to be expected that the Government should bind itself to a fixed time for the work to come to an end, and there is not a word in the instrument by which it did so, unless an undertaking contrary to what seems to us the implication is implied.\n The Government did fix the time very strictly for the contractor. It is contemplated that the contractor may be unknown, and he must satisfy the Government of his having the capital, experience, and ability to do the work. Much care is taken therefore to keep him up to the mark. Liquidated damages are fixed for his delays. But the only reference to delays on the Government side is in the agreement that if caused by its acts they will be regarded as unavoidable, which though probably inserted primarily for the contractor's benefit as a ground for extension of time, is not without a bearing on what the contract bound the Government to do. Delays by the building contractors were unavoidable from the point of view of both parties to the contract in suit. The plaintiff agreed to accept in full satisfaction for all work done under the \n\n[270 U.S. 4, 7]\n\u00a0\n contract the contract price, reduced by damages deducted for his delays and increased or reduced by the price of changes, as fixed by the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Works. Nothing more is allowed for changes, as to which the Government is master. It would be strange if it were bound for more in respect of matters presumably beyond its control. The contract price, it is said in another clause, shall cover all expenses of every nature connected with the work to be done. Liability was excluded expressly for utilities that the Government promised to supply. We are of opinion that the failure to exclude the present claim was due to the fact that the whole frame of the contract was understood to shut it out, although in some cases the Government's lawyers have been more careful.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 317\nArgued: May 5, 1926Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert H. Elder, of New York City, for petitioner.[ Hammer v. United States \n271 U.S. 620\n (1926) ]\n\n\n[271 U.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 620, 624]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was indicted on three counts in the Southern district of New York. A verdict of not guilty as to the first and third was directed by the court. The jury found him guilty on the second, and the court sentenced him to the penitentiary for a year and ten months. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. 6 F.(2d) 786.\n The second count sets forth that Annie Hammer was adjudged a bankrupt on April 28, 1923, and that the proceeding was referred to one of the referees in bankruptcy in that district. The substance of the charge is that October 25, 1923, petitioner suborned and induced Louis H. Trinz to take an oath before the referee, and there falsely to testify that prior to April 18, 1923, he had loaned $500 to the bankrupt, and that she had given him a note therefor. \n\n[271 U.S. 620, 625]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner contends that the making of a false oath in bankruptcy is not perjury, and that without perjury there cannot be subornation of perjury. Section 125 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10295) provides that whoever, having taken an oath before a competent officer, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify truly, shall state any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be fined not more than $2,000 and imprisoned for not more than five years. Section 29b of the Bankruptcy Act (30 Stat. 544, 554, c. 541 (Comp. St.  9613)), provides that a person shall be punished by imprisonment not to exceed two years upon conviction of the offense of having knowingly made a false oath in any proceeding in bankruptcy. Section 126 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10296) provides that whoever shall procure another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury and punishable as provided in section 125.\n It is plain that the offense charged includes perjury as defined by section 125. That section is in general terms and is broad enough to apply to persons sworn in bankruptcy proceedings. The facts alleged include all the elements of that offense, as well as the making of a false oath in bankruptcy, and they show a violation of both sections. The indictment does not specify the section under which it is drawn, but the omission is immaterial. The offense charged is to be determined by the allegations. Williams v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 382, 389\n, 18 S. Ct. 92. And it follows that petitioner was accused of subornation of perjury. Cf. Wechsler v. United States, 158 F. 579, 86 C. C. A. 37; Epstein v. United States, 196 F. 354, 116 C. C. A 174; Kahn v. United States, 214 F. 54, 130 C. C. A. 494; Ulmer v. United States, 219 F. 641, 134 C. C. A. 127; Schonfeld v. United States (C. C. A.) 277 F. 934. We need not consider whether perjury committed in bankruptcy proceedings may be punished by more than the maximum fixed by section 29b, as the sentence imposed on the petitioner is less \n\n[271 U.S. 620, 626]\n\u00a0\n than that. Nor need we consider whether every false oath in bankruptcy is perjury under section 125.\n Petitioner also contends that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain the judgment.\n At the trial of petitioner, it was satisfactorily shown that Trinz was sworn in the bankruptcy proceeding and there gave the testimony alleged to have been false and suborned. Trinz was the only witness called to prove the falsity and subornation. He testified that he gave the testimony alleged in the indictment, that it was not true, and that petitioner suborned him. At the close of all the evidence the petitioner moved the court to direct a verdict in his favor, on the ground that the uncorroborated testimony of Trinz was not sufficient to warrant a finding of guilt. The motion was denied; and, on the request of the prosecution, the court charged the jury that the law did not require any corroboration of that testimony, and that, if believed, it was sufficient.\n The question of law presented is whether the unsupported oath of Trinz at the trial of petitioner is sufficient to justify a finding that the testimony given by him before the referee was false. The general rule in prosecutions for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused set forth in the indictment as perjury. The application of that rule in federal and state courts is well nigh universal. \n1\n The rule has long prevailed, and no enactment in derogation of it has come to our attention. \n\n[271 U.S. 620, 627]\n\u00a0\n The absence of such legislation indicates that it is sound and has been found satisfactory in practice. On the issue of falsity the case presented is this: On the first occasion Trinz testified that he had loaned money to the bankrupt and that she had given him a note. At the trial he swore that his statement before the referee was not true. The contest is between the two oaths, with nothing to support either of them. The question is not the same as that arising in a prosecution for perjury, where the defendant's own acts, business transactions, documents, or correspondence are brought forward to establish the falsity of his oath alleged as perjury. That, in some cases, the falsity charged may be shown by evidence other than the testimony of living witnesses, is forcibly shown by the opinion of this court in United States v. Wood, 14 Pet. 430, 443. That case shows that the rule, which forbids conviction on the unsupported testimony of one witness as to falsity of the matter alleged as perjury, does not relate to the kind or amount of other evidence required to establish that fact. Undoubtedly in some cases documents emanating from the accused and the attending circumstances may constitute better evidence of such falsity than any amount of oral testimony. \n\n[271 U.S. 620, 628]\n\u00a0\n As petitioner cannot be guilty of subornation unless Trinz committed perjury before the referee, the evidence must be sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt the falsity of his oath alleged as perjury. The question is not whether the uncorroborated testimony of Trinz is enough to sustain a finding that he was suborned by the petitioner. It is whether, as against the petitioner, his testimony at the trial is enough to sustain a finding that his oath before the referee was false. Clearly the case is not as strong for the prosecution as where a witness, presumed to be honest and by the government vouched for as worthy of belief, is called to testify to the falsity of the oath of defendant set forth as perjury in the indictment. Here the sole reliance of the government is the unsupported testimony of one for whose character it cannot vouch-a dishonest man guilty of perjury on one occasion or the other. There is no reason why the testimony of such a one should be permitted to have greater weight than that of a witness not so discredited. People v. Evans, 40 N. Y. 1, 3.\n To hold to the rule in perjury and to deny its application in subornation cases would lead to unreasonable results. Section 332 of the Criminal Code abolishes the distinction between principals and accessories and makes them all principals. One who induces another to commit perjury is guilty of subornation under section 126, and by force of section 332 ( Comp. St.  10506) is also guilty of perjury. In substance, subornation is the same as perjury; and one accused of perjury and another accused of subornation may be indicted and tried together. Ruthenberg v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 480\n, 38 S. Ct. 168; Commonwealth v. Devine, 155 Mass. 224, 29 N. E. 515. Obviously the same rule of evidence in respect of establishing the falsity of the matter alleged as perjury must apply to both. Evidence that is not sufficient to warrant a finding of that fact as against the one accused of perjury cannot reasonably be held to be enough as against the \n\n[271 U.S. 620, 629]\n\u00a0\n other who is accused of suborning the perjury. No such distinction can be maintained. The rule that the uncorroborated testimony of one witness is not enough to establish falsity applies in subornation as well as in perjury cases. People v. Evans, supra. Falsity is as essential in one as in the other. It is the corpus delicti in both.\n The trial court should have directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the ground that the uncorroborated testimony of Trinz at the trial was not sufficient as against petitioner to establish the falsity of the oath alleged as perjury. We need not consider whether his testimony was sufficient to establish the fact of subornation.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

CARR(1926)\nNo. 179\nArgued: October 18, 1926Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, Charles S. Deneen and Frederick D. Silber, both of Chicago, Ill., and Rufus S. Day, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benson Landon and Leon Hornstein, both of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 494, 501]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214) to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois, affirming a decree of the superior court of Cook county dismissing the bill of the Hanover Fire Insurance Company, a corporation of New York, against Patrick J. Carr, county treasurer and ex officio tax collector of Cook county, Ill. The prayer was for an injunction to prevent the distraint of the property of the complainant under a warrant for the collection of $10,678.50 as taxes due under a law of Illinois, which law, the bill averred, denied to the complainant the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.\n The defendant filed an answer denying the claims of the bill and after a reply the case was heard by the trial court which made findings of fact in its decree based on a stipulation by the parties and entered a decree as set forth below.\n The law in question reads as follows:\n'Foreign Companies.-Tax on Net Receipts. Section 30. Every agent of any insurance company, incorporated by the authority of any other state or government, shall return to the proper officer of the county, town or munici- \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 502]\n\u00a0\n pality in which the agency is established, in the month of May, annually, the amount of the net receipts of such agency for the preceding year, which shall be entered on the tax lists of the county, town and municipality, and subject to the same rate of taxation, for all purposes-state, county, town and municipal-that other personal property is subject to at the place where located; said tax to be in lieu of all town and municipal licenses; and all laws and parts of laws inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed: Provided, that the provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit cities having an organized fire department from levying a tax, or license fee, not exceeding two per cent. in accordance with the provisions of their respective charters, on the gross receipts of such agency, to be applied exclusively to the support of the fire department of such city.' Cahill's Rev. Stat. Ill. 1925, p. 1405, c. 73,  159.\n\n This had been in force since 1869 and was part of the act of March 11 of that year, entitled 'An act to incorporate and to govern fire, marine and inland navigation insurance companies doing business in the state of Illinois.' The section was amended to the above form by an act approved May 31, 1879\n\n\n By section 22 and other sections of the original act of 1869 ( Cahill's Rev. Stat. Ill. 1925, p. 1402, c. 73,  150), it was made unlawful for a foreign insurance company to transact any insurance business in the state unless it had a prescribed amount of capital, appointed an attorney in the state on whom process of law could be served, filed a properly certified copy of the charter or deed of settlement of the insurance company, showing its name and the place where located, the amount of its capital and a detailed statement of its assets, together with its indebtedness, the losses adjusted and unpaid, the amount incurred and in process of adjustment, and a copy of its last annual report. It was required also to deposit with the director \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 503]\n\u00a0\n of trade and commerce of the state, for the benefit and security of the policy holders residing in the United States, a sum of not less than $200, 000 in 6 per centum stock of the United States or the state of Illinois, or approved mortgage securities, with a provision that, so long as the company should continue solvent and comply with the laws of the state, it might collect the interest on these securities. The law provided that it should not be lawful for the agents of the company to transact business without procuring annually from the director of trade and commerce the authority stating that such company had complied with all the requisitions of the act which applied to it, and that any violation of the provisions of the act should subject the one violating it to a penalty not exceeding $ 500 for each violation; that such insurance companies should make annual statements of their condition and affairs to the director of trade and commerce in the same manner and in the same form as similar insurance companies organized under the laws of the state, on or before the first day of March in each year for the year ending on the preceding 30th of September. The insurance superintendent was given authority by the same act to investigate affairs of the foreign companies, such investigation to be at the expense of the company, and if he found the condition of any one unsound, to close up the business of the company by application to the circuit court of the county in which it had its principal office. By the same act, each foreign company was required to pay $30 for filing the charter, $10 for filing the annual statement required, and $2 for each certificate of authority for agents, and certain other fees of a similar character. Paragraphs 150, 152, 156, Cahill's Rev. Stat. Ill. 1925, c. 73.\n By the Act of June 28, 1919 (Cahill's Rev. Stat. Ill. 1925, p. 1390, c. 73,  79), it was provided that each nonresident corporation licensed and admitted to do an insur- \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 504]\n\u00a0\n ance business in the state should pay an annual state tax for the privilege of so doing, equal to 2 per centum of the gross amount of premiums received during the preceding calendar year on contracts covering risks within the state after certain reductions; that the tax should be in lieu of all license fees or privilege or occupation taxes levied or assessed by any municipality in the state, and that no municipality should impose any license fee, privilege or occupation tax upon such corporation for the privilege of doing an insurance business therein; but this should not be construed to prohibit the levy and collection of any state, county or municipal taxes upon the real and personal property of such corporations, or the levying and collection of taxes authorized by section 30 above quoted.\n By section 12 of the same act (Cahill's Rev. Stat. Ill. p. 1391, c. 73,  90), it was provided that if any corporation should fail or neglect to make any report, or to refuse to pay any tax assessment within 30 days after the same became due, the department of trade and commerce should have power to revoke its license to transact the business of insurance in the state, or to suspend it until the reports were filed or the taxes paid.\n The complainant insurance company complied with the requirements of section 22 and other unrepealed sections of the act of 1869 and paid the 2 per cent. tax on its premiums received as provided by the act of 1919.\n By the General Revenue Act of Illinois, in force since February 25, 1898 (Cahill's Rev. Stat. 1925, p. 2042, c. 120,  329), personal property is to be valued at its fair cash value, which value is to be set down in one column to be headed 'Full Value,' and one-half part thereof is to be ascertained and set down in another column headed 'Assessed Value.' The one-half value of all the property so ascertained and set down is to be the value for all purposes of taxation. It is further stipulated in this case and found by the trial court that for the \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 505]\n\u00a0\n year 1923, and for many years prior thereto, there has been what is called an equalization which systematically and intentionally reduces the amount set down in the column headed 'Full Value' to not more than 60 per cent. of the actual market value of the personal property returned and by further reducing this by 50 per cent. to make the assessed value in accord with the statute, the tax is collected only on 30 per cent. of the full value.\n This suit presents the question of the validity of the assessment made by taxing officers under section 30 for the year 1922. The Supreme Court of Illinois, in People v. Barrett, 309 Ill. 53, 139 N. E. 903, in an opinion announced June 20, 1923, near the close of the year for which the assessment of 1922 was made, held that the tax under section 30 was an occupation tax and that no reduction should be permitted to foreign insurance companies in the assessment for taxation of their annual net receipts. The superior court found that the actual amount of net cash receipts of the complainant company was $90,824, less by $45,000 than the amount reported by the board of review, so that its decree forbade the collection of more than $7,184.18, instead of $10,678.50, for which the warrant had issued, but denied further relief. The complainant insisted that under the previous practice and proper construction of section 30 as a property tax, with due equalization and debasement, the tax assessed should have been $2,155.24, and that this, if anything, is all that should be collected from it. The Supreme Court by a divided court, three judges dissenting, affirmed the decree of the superior court. Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Carr, 317 Ill. 366, 148 N. E. 23.\n The petitioner is an insurance corporation organized under the laws of the state of New York. By its charter it is authorized to do a business of insurance against the hazard of fire, marine perils, inland navigation, tornado, theft, explosion, property damage to automobiles and \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 506]\n\u00a0\n other property by collision, crop insurance, and other similar lines of insurance against specified hazards. There are in Illinois domestic insurance companies which do business in all of such risks. In Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Board of Review, 264 Ill. 11, 105 N. E. 7048 decided in 1914, the Supreme Court held that the only insurance companies whose receipts come within section 30 are foreign fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance companies doing business in the state. And if they do business in the other hazards above stated, as the complainant and petitioner is authorized to do, then they must pay taxes on their net receipts made not only from fire, marine, and inland navigation company business, but also from the other hazards.\n The situation then is that a foreign fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance company like the petitioner must pay at a rate per centum equivalent to that imposed on personal property a tax on the cash amount or 100 per cent. of its net receipts from all its insurance business. A domestic fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance company pays no tax on its net receipts from any kind of insurance. Both pay on their personal property other than net receipts as of a fixed date in each year on an assessment of 30 per cent. of its full value.\n The Supreme Court of Illinois for many years held the payment of a tax on the net receipts was a tax on personal property. Walker v. Springfield, 94 Ill. 364; City of Chicago v. James, 114 Ill. 479, 2 N. E. 475; 264 Ill. 11, 105 N. E. 704, decided in 1914, the 276, 18 N. E. 668; National Fire Insurance Co. v. Hanberg, 215 Ill. 378, 74 N. E. 377; People v. Cosmopolitan Fire Insurance Co., 246 Ill. 442, 92 N. E. 922. The net receipts were the gross receipts from each agency after the operating expenses had been deducted. The losses from fire and other risks assumed were not deducted. National Fire Insurance Co. v. Hanberg, 215 Ill. 378, 74 N. E. 377. It is quite apparent from reading these cases that in prac- \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 507]\n\u00a0\n tice the net receipts were treated as personal property and their assessment was by equalization and debasement reduced from full value as all other personal property, until the decisions in People v. Kent, 300 Ill. 324, 133 N. E. 276 (1921), and in People v. Barrett, 309 Ill. 53, 139 N. E. 903.\n The general principle upon which the Supreme Court of Illinois holds the tax complained of herein to be valid is that the payment of it is part of the condition which the petitioner as a foreign insurance company is obliged to perform in order to maintain and retain its right to do business in the state. It was settled in the Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, Ducat v. Chicago, 10 Wall. 410, and Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 305\n, 12 S. Ct. 403, that foreign corporations cannot do business in a state except by the consent of the state; that the state may exclude them arbitrarily or impose such conditions as it will upon their engaging in business within its jurisdiction. But there is a very important qualification to this power of the state, the recognition and enforcement of which are shown in a number of decisions of recent years. That qualification is that the state may not exact as a condition of the corporation's engaging in business within its limits that its rights secured to it by the Constitution of the United States may be infringed. This is illustrated in respect to the breach of the commerce clause of the Constitution by the case of Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 35 S. Ct. 57 and Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 38 S. Ct. 85. It is illustrated in cases in which a provision of a state law revoking the license of a foreign corporation for exercising its constitutional right to remove suits brought against them from the state courts to the federal courts has been held void, Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529\n, 42 S. Ct. 188, 21 A. L. R. 186; in cases in which the state has vainly attempted to subject foreign corporations to a payment of a tax which is a tax, not only on the property of \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 508]\n\u00a0\n the corporation in the state, but also on its property without the state, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S. Ct. 190; St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n, 43 S. Ct. 125; and finally in cases of a class to which it is contended the present case belongs, where a tax or license law operates to deny to the foreign corporation the equal protection of the laws, Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400\n, 30 S. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Air Way Corporation v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71\n, 45 S. Ct. 12. In the former of these last two cases a railway corporation of another state had come into Alabama and secured a license to do business therein as an intrastate railway and in course of that business had acquired in the state property of a fixed and permanent nature upon which it had paid all the taxes levied by the state. It was held that a new and additional franchise tax for the privilege of doing business within the state, not imposed upon domestic corporations doing business in the state of the same character, violated the equal protection clause. In Air Way Corporation v. Day, a corporation of Delaware had much or all of its property in Ohio where it was duly authorized to do business. Thereafter a law of Ohio imposed five cents a share upon a certain proportion of non- par shares authorized by the state of Delaware which the court found to be arbitrary and not based on a classification of foreign corporations having any reasonable basis.\n In the present case there is no such permanent investment in the state of Illinois as there was in the Greene Case in Alabama, but the averments of the bill show that the complainant has from year to year secured renewal of its license in the state of Illinois, and has through many years past built up a large good will in the state if Illinois and has associated with it a large number of agents in the various counties of the state, whose connection with it has resulted in a large and profitable business to \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 509]\n\u00a0\n the complainant, and that it has large numbers of records containing information respecting its policy holders, the character and nature of their policies and other records, the value of all of which would be destroyed if excluded from the state by a denial of the equal protection of the laws. In the Greene Case the license was indefinite. In this case it must be renewed from year to year, but the principle is the same that pending the period of business permitted by the state, the state must not enforce against its licensees unconstitutional burdens.\n It is insisted that we must accept the construction of section 30 by the state Supreme Court, and as the tax levied is sustained by its construction, and has been held by the court to be an indispensable condition upon which the petitioner may continue to do business in Illinois, this court is bound by both those conclusions.\n It is true that the interpretation put upon such a tax law of a state by its Supreme Court is binding upon this court as to its meaning; but it is not true that this court, in accepting the meaning thus given, may not exercise its independent judgment in determining whether, with the meaning given, its effect would not involve a violation of the federal Constitution. As said by this court in St. Louis Southwestern Railway v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, at page 362, 35 S. Ct. 99, 102 (59 L. Ed. 265), where the question was whether a tax law violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:\n'Upon the mere question of construction we are of course concluded by the decision of the state court of last resort. But when the question is whether a tax imposed by a state deprives a party of rights secured by the federal Constitution, the decision is not dependent upon the form in which the taxing scheme is cast, nor upon the characterization of that scheme as adopted by the state court. We must regard the substance, rather than the \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 510]\n\u00a0\n form, and the controlling test is to be found in the operation and effect of the law as applied and enforced by the state.'\n\n This view has been upheld in many cases. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 30 S. Ct. 190; Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n216 \nU.S. 146\n, 30 S. Ct. 280; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197\n, 35 S. Ct. 57; St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n, 43 S. Ct. 125. In the last case the question was whether a foreign corporation doing business in Arkansas could be required by a law of the state to pay a so-called occupation tax upon premiums paid by it to insurance companies not doing business in Arkansas for insurance upon property of the corporation in Arkansas; the policies having been issued and accepted outside of Arkansas. This court held the tax invalid, as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In reaching this conclusion, this court said ( page 348 (43 S. Ct. 125)):\n'The Supreme Court justified the imposition as an occupation tax-that is, as we understand it, a tax upon the occupation of the defendant. But this court, although bound by the construction that the Supreme Court may put upon the statute, is not bound by the characterization of it so far as that characterization may bear upon the question of its constitutional effect.'\n\n In subjecting a law of the state which imposes a charge upon foreign corporations to the test whether such a charge violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a line has to be drawn between the burden imposed by the state for the license or privilege to do business in the state and the tax burden which, having secured the right to do business, the foreign corporation must share with all the corporations and other taxpayers of the state. With respect to the admission fee, so to speak, which the foreign corporation must pay to become a quasi citizen of the state and entitled to \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 511]\n\u00a0\n equal privileges with citizens of the state, the measure of the burden is in the discretion of the state and any inequality as between the foreign corporation and the domestic corporation in that regard does not come within the inhibition of the Fourteenth Amendment; but after its admission, the foreign corporation stands equal, and is to be classified, with domestic corporations of the same kind.\n In this class of cases, therefore, the question of the application of the equal protection clause turns on the stage at which the foreign corporation is put on a level with domestic corporations in engaging in business within the state. To leave the determination of such a question finally to a state court would be to deprive this court of its independent judgment in determining whether a federal constitutional limitation has been infringed. While we may not question the meaning of the tax law as interpreted by the state court in the manner and effect in which it is to be enforced, we must re-examine the question passed upon by the state court as to whether the law complained of is a part of the condition upon which admission to do business of the state is permitted and is merely a regulating license by the state to protect the state and its citizens in dealing with such corporation, or whether it is a tax law for the purpose of securing contributions to the revenue of the state as they are made by other taxpayers of the state. Our power and duty in this regard must follow from our decisions, and while the exact question has not heretofore been considered, there can be no doubt that our conclusion finds its complete support in the analogies of other cases in which we have had to determine what our duty is in dealing with the alleged invalidity of state legislation. Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 239\n, 31 S. Ct. 145; Corn Products Co. v. Eddy, \n249 \nU.S. 427, 432\n, 39 S. Ct. 325; Appleby v. New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364\n, 46 S. Ct. 569 (June 1, 1926); Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 325 S., 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375. What, therefore, we have \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 512]\n\u00a0\n to decide here is whether the application of section 30 can be one of the conditions upon which the insurance company is admitted to do business in Illinois, or whether under the law of 1919 the authority granted by the department of trade and commerce for which the company paid 2 per cent. of gross premiums received the previous year by it put it upon a level with domestic insurance companies doing business of the same character.\n It is plain that compliance with section 30 is not a condition precedent to permission to do business in Illinois. The state Supreme Court concedes this, but its reasoning that payment of the tax under the section is a condition to its doing business in Illinois which may vary at the will of the state, without regard to taxes on similar domestic corporations, is shown by the following passages:\n'The fact that a tax is a privilege tax does not necessarily require that it be paid as a condition precedent to entering the state. Such a condition, being precedent, could, of course, be met but once. However, the greatest financial benefit to such a company flows from the continuation of the privilege to do business. Compensation for that privilege should be based on the benefits actually derived from the business done under such privilege, and such compensation must necessarily be assessed in some manner after the business is done and the benefits thereof received. Section 30 provides the method by which the amount of this compensation shall be determined and assessed.' Page 373 (148 N. E. 26).\n\n'Section 22 of the act relating to fire, marine and inland navigation insurance, aside from specifying certain requirements imposed upon foreign insurance companies seeking to do business in this state and specifying what shall be necessary to secure the right of entry, further provides: 'Nor shall it be lawful for any agent or agents to act for any company or companies referred to in this section, directly or indirectly, in taking risks or transact- \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 513]\n\u00a0\n ing the business of fire and inland navigation insurance in this state, without procuring annually from the insurance superintendent a certificate of authority, stating that such company has complied with all the requisitions of this act which apply to such companies and the name of the attorney appointed to act for the company.' The provisions of section 30 requiring the return of net receipts of this tax are a part of the 'requisitions of this act.' It is evident, therefore, from the language in section 22 quoted, that before appellant may continue in business in this state its agent shall procure annually from the insurance superintendent of the state or his successor in law, a certificate showing that it has complied with the requirements of section 30 with reference to this tax. Such certificate cannot be lawfully issued without such showing. This act provides no other means of collecting such tax and no reference is made for its collection.' Page 374 (148 N. E. 26).\n\n The court then refers to another act, which imposes a penalty for violation of section 30 by placing risks or policies of indemnity upon property in any other manner than through its regularly authorized agents, and justifying a revocation of the license for a period of not less than 90 days and that it shall not be reissued until it appears that there is complete compliance with the laws of the state governing such companies and until it has been shown that all taxes and penalties and expenses due thereunder have been paid.\n'It seems clear, therefore,' says the court (page 375 (148 N. E. 26)), 'that this tax is levied as compensation for the privilege of continuing their business in the state.\n\n'While the act of 1919 (Laws 1919, p. 628) imposes an annual state tax equal to 2 per cent. on the gross amount of premiums received by any foreign insurance company during the preceding year, ... that fact does not show that the tax imposed on the business of fire insurance by section 30 is not likewise a tax for the privilege of doing \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 514]\n\u00a0\n business. The act of 1919 requires that the tax there levied be paid to the state. Section 30 requires that the tax be apportioned among the state and the different municipalities of the situs of the agency. A valid reason is seen for this distribution of the tax. The foreign fire insurance company takes its net proceeds largely from the vicinity of its agencies, and it is but just that it return to the municipality in which its agency is located something in lieu of the taxes that would otherwise be realized from such net receipts as are taken away.'\n\n The view of the court seems to be that the constitutional necessity for equal application of the laws of the state to foreign and domestic corporations properly engaged in business is avoided if only the state provides that failure to comply with the laws during the period or at the end of the period for which the license runs justifies a revocation of the license pending the period, or a refusal to grant a new license for the following year. We do not think the state may thus relieve itself from granting the equal protection of its laws to a foreign company which has met the conditions precedent to its becoming a quasi domestic citizen. Of course at the end of the year for which the license has been granted, the state may in its discretion impose as conditions precedent for a renewed license past compliance with its valid laws; but that does not enable the state to make past compliance with section 30 a condition precedent to a renewal of the license, if as we find that section violates the Fourteenth Amendment, for, as already said, while a state may forbid a foreign corporation to do business within its jurisdiction, or to continue it, it may not do so by imposing on a corporation a sacrifice of its constitutional rights. We have said in Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147\n, 38 S. Ct. 295, and in Kansas City, etc., Railroad Co. v. Stiles, \n242 \nU.S. 111, 118\n, 37 S. Ct. 58, that a state does not surrender or abridge its power to change and revise \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 515]\n\u00a0\n its taxing system and tax rates by merely licensing or permitting a foreign corporation to engage in local business and acquire property within its limits, and that a state may impose a different rate of taxation upon a foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business within the state than it applies to its own corporations upon the franchise which the state grants them; but the decision in Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, supra, shows that this power to change the tax imposed on a foreign corporation as a condition for the license of continuing business is not unlimited, and that any attempt in a renewal to vary the terms of the original license which, however indirectly, enforces a new condition upon the corporation and involves a deprivation of its federal constitutional rights, cannot be effective. The state, in dealing with foreign corporations, may properly and without discrimination as between them and domestic companies regulate the former by a provision that for a failure by them to comply with any valid law governing the conduct of their business in the state the license already granted may be revoked. That is a legitimate condition in the treatment of foreign companies which do not have property and home within the state. It is a police regulation. But the power thus to revoke a license for breach of a law can only be validly exercised, if the law be a constitutional one. By compliance with the valid conditions precedent, the foreign insurance company is put on a level with all other insurance companies of the same kind, domestic or foreign within the state, and tax laws made to apply after it has been so received into the state are to be considered laws enacted for the purpose of raising revenue for the state and must conform to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This conclusion is not only in accord with our previous decisions but is sustained by the reasoning in a satisfactory judgment of the Court of Errors and Appeals \n\n[272 U.S. 494, 516]\n\u00a0\n of New Jersey. Erie Railway Co. v. State, 31 N. J. Law, 531, 542, 543, 544, 86 Am. Dec. 226.\n We thus reach the question whether a tax imposed upon foreign fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance companies on the net receipts of all their business, whether fire, marine, inland navigation, or other risks, is a denial of the equal protection of the laws when domestic insurance companies pay no taxes on such net receipts. Under the previous decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois, when the net receipts were treated as personal property and the assessment thereon as a personal property tax subjected to the same reductions for equalization and debasement, it might well have been said that there was no substantial inequality as between domestic corporations and foreign corporations, in that the net receipts were personal property acquired during the year and removed by foreign companies out of the state, and could be required justly to yield a tax fairly equivalent to that which the domestic companies would have to pay on all their personal property including their net receipts or what they were invested in. It was this view, doubtless, which led to the acquiescence by the state authorities and the foreign insurance companies in such a construction of section 30 and in the practice under it. But an occupation tax imposed upon 100 per cent. of the net receipts of foreign insurance companies admitted to do business in Illinois is a heavy discrimination in favor of domestic insurance companies of the same class and in the same business which pay only a tax on the assessment of personal property at a valuation reduced to one-half of 60 per cent. of the full value of that property. It is a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350, 352\n, 353 S., 38 S. Ct. 495; Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400\n, 30 S.

A.) 270 F. 369, 374.\n One argument urged against our conclusion is that the relation of a foreign insurance company to the state which permits it to do business within its limits is contractual, and that by coming into the state and engaging in business on the conditions imposed it waives all constitutional restrictions and cannot object to a condition or law regulating its obligations even though as a statute operating in invitum it may be in conflict with constitutional limitations. This argument cannot prevail, in view of the decisions of this court in well-considered cases. Insurance Co. v. Morse. 20 Wall. 445; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.

BERGDOLL(1926)\nNo. 181\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. A. Harrigan and Joseph W. Catharine, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner. \n\n[270 U.S. 560, 561]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. B. Gibbons and Harry C. Kohlhas, Jr., both of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Harrigan, trustee in bankruptcy of the Louis J. Bergdoll Motor Company, brought this suit in a state court of Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1921, to recover $155,571.79 and interest from Bergdoll, a stockholder in the company. The defendant, a resident of the state, pleaded the general six-year statute of limitations. The claim sued on is the assessment, ordered by the bankruptcy court, of 51.85 per cent. of the par value on shares in the company held by the defendant; the amount being found by that court to be unpaid on the stock and required to satisfy the liabilities. \n\n[270 U.S. 560, 562]\n\u00a0\n The corporation had been organized under the laws of Pennsylvania about April 1, 1912, had its place of business there, and was adjudged bankrupt in the federal court for the Eastern district of the state in April, 1913. It was then insolvent. In May, 1913, it had become apparent that the company's liabilities largely exceeded its assets, other than the amounts unpaid on its capital stock. The petition of the trustee to the bankruptcy court, praying that the assessment be made, and that he be authorized to proceed to collect the same, was not filed until October, 1917\n\n\n The application then made was strenuously opposed by Bergdoll. The order for the assessment was entered by the referee in February, 1918, but was not confirmed by the District Court until July, 1919. In re Bergdoll Motor Co., 260 F. 234. That was more than six years after the deficiency had become apparent. The judgment of the District Court, besides making the assessment, ordered Bergdoll to pay the same. On this ground, among others, Bergdoll appealed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. In March, 1920, that court affirmed the judgment, in so far as it adjudicated the necessity for an assessment, fixed the rate and levied the same upon those who appear prima facie to be subject thereto, but reversed the judgment in so far as it had adjudged the personal liability of Bergdoll and the amount thereof. Bergdoll v. Harrigan (C. C. A.) 263 F. 279, 281, 283. Thereafter this suit was brought in the state court. The trial court ruled that the statute of limitations had run before the suit was instituted. Its judgment was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 126 A. 269, 281 P. 186. This court granted a writ of certiorari. 45 S. Ct. 123, \n266 U.S. 598\n.\n The reversal by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the judgment of the District Court, in so far as it adjudged the liability of Bergdoll, was in accord with the rule, settled in the Third circuit and elsewhere, that the order of assessment and levy is a purely administrative proceeding pre- \n\n[270 U.S. 560, 563]\n\u00a0\n liminary to the institution of a suit, in the absence of consent there is no jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court to fix the personal liability of a stockholder, and that any person whose stock is assessed may when sued in a plenary action on such assessment in any court of competent jurisdiction make any defense thereto affecting his individual liability, but may not attack the administrative order of the District Court in determining the need of an assessment, or in levying the same. Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Purdy, 16 S. Ct. 810, \n162 U.S. 329\n, 336-337; In re Remington Automobile & Motor Co., 153 F. 345, 82 C. C. A. 421; In re Munger Vehicle Tire Co., 168 F. 910, 94 C. C. A. 314; In re M. Stipp Construction Co., 221 F. 372, 137 C. C. A. 180. The District Court recognized this rule. It erred, as the Court of Appeals held, in concluding that Bergdoll had consented to the exercise by the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to determine whether he was personally liable.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of the state holding that the statute of limitations had run was said to be an application of the state law, settled at least since Swearingen v. Sewickley Dairy Co., 47 A. 941, 198 Pa. 68, 53 L. R. A. 471, decided in 1901, that the liability of a shareholder in a Pennsylvania business corporation to creditors of the company on account of stock not full-paid becomes fixed at the time it is definitely ascertained that the company is insolvent and will be obliged to call unpaid stock subscriptions in order to satisfy its obligations; that, as soon as the deficiency of assets becomes apparent, it becomes the duty of creditors, if they desire to obtain payment of their claims, to take the necessary steps to bring about a formal determination of the extent of the assessment on unpaid stock subscriptions necessary to liquidate the indebtedness and also to begin proper action to collect such amount from the respective stockholders within the time limited by the general statute of limitations. The sole question for decision is whether the state law governs in view of the proceedings had in bankruptcy. \n\n[270 U.S. 560, 564]\n\u00a0\n The trustee contends that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until March 27, 1920, the date of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which confirmed the order making the assessment and authorized suit to collect it. This contention rests upon the assumption that Nergdoll's liability remained contingent until the entry of that judgent and, hence, that the cause of action arose then. The highest court of Pennsylvania has held that assessment was not a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action, and that the liability became absolute without an assessment, either by the corporation or by any court, as soon as the need of this asset for paying debts became apparent. Compare Potts v. Wallace, 13 S. Ct. 196, \n146 U.S. 689\n; Kelley v. Gill, 38 S. Ct. 38, \n245 U.S. 116\n, 121. The nature, the extent, and the conditions of the liability of a stockholder on account of stock not full-paid depend primarily upon the law of the state or country by which the corporation was created. Glenn v. Liggett, 10 S. Ct. 867, \n135 U.S. 533\n, 548, Compare Benedict v. Ratner, 45 S. Ct. 566, \n268 U.S. 353\n, 359.1 That law determines whether the liability is to the corporation or is to creditors. \n2\n Compare Converse v. Hamilton, 32 S. Ct. 415, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 253, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Selig v. Hamilton, 34 S. Ct. 926, \n234 U.S. 652\n, 658, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 104. If the liability is to the corporation, it passes like other choses in action to the trustee in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Law ( Comp. St. ss 9585-9656) does not modify this right of action against the stockholder or create a new one. It merely provides that the right created by the state law shall pass to the trustee and be enforced by him for the benefit of creditors. The order \n\n[270 U.S. 560, 565]\n\u00a0\n of assessment and the direction that the trustee sue to recover were appropriate administrative proceedings in bankruptcy. See In re Miller Electrical Maintenance Co. (D. C.) 111 F. 515. But it was for the court of Pennsylvania to say whether they were indispensable to the enforcement of the stockholder's liability.\n Scovill v. Thayer, \n105 U.S. 143\n, upon which the trustee relied, is not inconsistent with the conclusion stated. That was a suit brought in the federal court for Massachusetts to enforce the liability of a stockholder in a Kansas corporation. The courts of Kansas had not settled when the cause of action created by its law arose. The trial court and this court were, therefore, obliged to decide that question of state law. See Burgess v.

Philip Kates, of Tulsa, Okl., and Samuel A. Mitchell, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry B. Martin, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the course of the administration of the estate of the bankrupt corporation in the District Court for Eastern Oklahoma, the petitioner Harrison, the trustee in bankruptcy, filed a petition for a summary order requiring Mrs. Chamberlin, the respondent, a stranger to the proceeding, to deliver to him certain money in her possession which, he alleged, was the property of the bankrupt, held by her fraudulently and without color or claim of title. She filed a demurrer for want of jurisdiction in the court to proceed summarily. This was overruled. She then answered, asserting that the money was her individual property, acquired and held by her in good faith; and renewing her jurisdictional objection. The matter was referred to the referee in bankruptcy to report his findings of fact and conclusions of law. He reported, upon the evidence, that the respondent's claim was based on fraud and merely colorable; and that the money was an asset of the estate and subject to the summary jurisdiction of the court. The District Judge confirmed this report and entered a decree finding that the money was an asset of the estate, held by the respondent without color of title and in fraud of the rights of the trustee; and ordering that she deliver it to him forthwith. She appealed from this order to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and also filed a petition for revision in matter of law. The Circuit Court of Appeals, being of opinion that as questions of fact were involved in the hearing, the method of review was by appeal, dismissed the petition to revise. On the appeal, it held that the claim of \n\n[271 U.S. 191, 193]\n\u00a0\n the respondent was adverse to the trustee and not merely colorable, and that the District Court was therefore without jurisdiction to proceed against the respondent summarily; and the order of the District Court was reversed, with instructions to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice to the institution of a plenary action by the trustee in any court of proper jurisdiction.

Ct. 98.\n The contentions of the trustee are: (1) That the Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to review the order of the District Court under the appeal; and (2) that, even if such jurisdiction existed, the decree reversing that order was erroneous.\n\n 1. \nIt is clear that the proceeding instituted by the trustee for the recovery of property in the possession of the respondent, to which she asserted an adverse claim, presented 'a controversy arising in a bankruptcy proceeding'-as distinguished from an administrative 'proceeding' in bankruptcy-which might be reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, as to fact and law, by an appeal taken under section 24a of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9608). Taylor v. Voss (No. 199) \n271 \nU.S. 176\n, 46 S. Ct. 461, this day decided and cases therein cited; Hinds v. Moore, 134 F. 221, 223, 67 C. C. A. 149; In re Eilers Music House ( C. C. A.) 270 F. 915, 925.\n\n 2. \nIt is well settled that a court of bankruptcy is without jurisdiction to adjudicate in a summary proceeding a controversy in reference to property held adversely to the bankrupt estate, without the consent of the adverse claimant; but resort must be had by the trustee to a plenary suit. Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 22 S. Ct. 269; Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18, 24\n, 22 S. Ct. 293; Jaquith v. Rowley, \n188 \nU.S. 620, 623\n, 23 S. Ct. 369; Schweer v.

A.) 287 \n\n[271 U.S. 191, 194]\n\u00a0\n F. 433, 435, 437. However, the court is not ousted of its jurisdiction by the mere assertion of an adverse claim; but, having the power in the first instance to determine whether it has jurisdiction to proceed, the court may enter upon a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the adverse claim is real and substantial or merely colorable. And if found to be merely colorable the court may then proceed to adjudicate the merits summarily; but if found to be real and substantial it must decline to determine the merits and dismiss the summary proceeding. Mueller v. Nugent, supra, 15 (22 S. Ct. 269); Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, supra, 25 (22 S. Ct. 293); Taubel Co. v. Fox, supra, 433 (44 S. Ct. 396); May v. Henderson, supra, 116 (45 S. Ct. 456); Board of Education v. Leary, supra, 525 (149 C. C. A. 573); Lynch v. Roberson, supra, 436.\n In the present case the holding of the District Court that the adverse claim was merely colorable was evidently based upon its conclusion, upon the entire evidence, that the claim was fraudulent; and was, in effect, an adjudication upon the merits. And, on the other hand, the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the claim was of such a substantial character as to require its determination in a plenary suit, was based upon the view 'that a claim alleged to be adverse is only colorably so when, admitting the facts to be as alleged by the claimant, there is, as matter of law, no adverseness in the claim.' It is clear, however, that an actual claim may be adverse and substantil even though in fact 'fraudulent and voidable.' Mueller v. Nugent, supra, 15 (22 S. Ct. 269); Johnston v. Spencer, 195 F. 215, 220, 115 C. C. A. 167; Board of Education v. Leary, supra, 525 (149 C. C. A. 573). And, on the other hand, a claim is merely colorable if 'on its face made in bad faith and without any legal justification.' May v. Henderson, supra, 109 (45 S. Ct. 456).\n Without entering upon a discussion of various cases in the Circuit Courts of Appeals in which divergent views have been expressed as to the test to be applied in deter- \n\n[271 U.S. 191, 195]\n\u00a0\n mining whether an adverse claim is substantial or merely colorable, we are of opinion that it is to be deemed of a substantil character when the claimant's contention 'discloses a contested matter of right, involving some fair doubt and reasonable room for controversy,' Board of Education v. Leary, supra, 527 (149 C. C. A. 573), in matters either of fact or law; and is not to be held merely colorable unless the preliminary inquiry shows that it is so unsubstantial and obviously insufficient, either in fact or law, as to be plainly without color of merit, and a mere pretense. Compare Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 44 S. Ct. 96, \n263 U.S. 291\n, 295; and Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange (No. 200) \n270 \nU.S. 593\n, 46 S. Ct. 367, decided April 12, 1926\n\n\n In the present case it clearly appears that the validity of the respondent's claim depended upon disputed facts, as to which there was a conflict of evidence, as well as a controversy in matter of law. Its determination invloved 'fair doubt and reasonable room for controversy' both as to fact and law. It was therefore substantial, and not merely colorable; and its merits could only be adjudged in a plenary suit.\n As the respondent's objection to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was well taken, and there was no waiver of her right in this respect, Galbraith v. Vallely, supra, 50 (41 S. Ct. 415), the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTSVILLE OIL MILL v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 609\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Christie Benet, of Columbia, S. C., and Challen B. Ellis and Don F. Reed, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., \n\n[271 U.S. 43, 44]\n\u00a0\n Paul Shipman Andrews, of Syracuse, N. Y., and Arthur M. Loeb and Harold Horvitz, Sp. Asst. Attys. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On February 5, 1923, a bill (S. 4479) was introduced in the Senate authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to 285 named persons, firms, and corporations, including the appellant, 'which entered into contracts with the United States of America through the agency of the United States Ordinance Department, which contracts were canceled by said Ordinance Department, the several sums set opposite their names.' By Senate Resolution of March 3, 1922, the bill, with accompanying documents, was referred to the Court of Claims for consideration and report. Judicial Code,  151 (Comp. St.  1142). Appellant filed its petition in the Court of Claims, referring to the Senate bill and resolution setting up a claim upon a contract of September 26, 1918, for the sale of cotton linters to the government. The Court of Claims held, upon the facts found, that it had jurisdiction to render a judgment under the provisions of chapter 7 of the Judicial Code; that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover upon its claim, and entered judgment dismissing the petition.\n The case comes here on appeal. Judicial Code,  242 (Comp. St.  1219 ), before its repeal by the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 941).\n The petition sets out a cause of action for failure of the government to perform its contract of September 26, 1918, and by way of anticipation of a defense, alleges that a later contract of December 31, 1918, between appellant and the government, purporting to cancel the earlier contract, was procured by duress and was without consideration. The jurisdiction to hear and determine the \n\n[271 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n claim is conferred by Judicial Code,  145 (Comp. St.  1136), and was not enlarged or otherwise affected by the Senate resolution.\n The petitioner, a South Carolina corporation, was engaged in the business of crushing cotton seed for the production of cotton seed oil, cotton seed meal and other cotton seed products, including cotton linters, which are the short fibers adhering to cotton seed after the removal of the staple cotton by ginning. During the late war, cotton linters were used extensively in the manufacture of explosives. After the entry of the United States into the war, appellant, with all others engaged in the production of cotton seed products, became subject to the direction and control of the War Industries Board (Act May 20, 1918, c. 78, 40 Stat. 556 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  283a-283f)), and of the United States Food Administration (Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 e et seq.)), with respect to the production and distribution of their product and the prices of both the raw material purchased and the product sold by them. This control was an essential feature of a plan to stabilize price and stimulate production.\n Appellant, by its contract, which was similar in form and content to those of the other manufacturers named in the Senate resolution, agreed to sell to the government its estimated product of cotton linters for the year ending July 31, 1918, approximately 2,250,000 pounds, at 4.67 cents per pound. The contract contained a clause authorizing the government to cancel it 'in the event of the termination of the present war' with the proviso that the seller should continue to make deliveries for 30 days after the effective date of the cancellation and that the government should save the seller harmless from actual loss resulting from the cancellation.\n In November, 1918, after the Armistice, negotiations were begun between the Cotton Products Section of the War Industries Board and a committee representing appellant and other manufacturers, for the adjustment \n\n[271 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n and settlement of all obligations upon appellant's contract of September 26th and all similar contracts. In the course of these negotiations it was contended by the representatives of the government and denied by the committee that the termination of the war had occurred, within the meaning of the cancellation clause. The War Industries Board ceased to function on December 21, 1918, and these negotiations were continued on behalf of the government by representatives of the Ordinance Department. On December 30, 1918, officers of this department notified the committee that the government would settle its obligations upon these contracts only by accepting the linters then on hand and inspected, about 270,000 bales, and would take only a part of the linters produced between January 1 and July 31, 1919, not to exceed 150,000 bales, the amount taken to be prorated among the manufacturers. At the same time they notified the committee that, unless this proposal was accepted within one hour from the time it was made, the government would refuse to perform its contracts, and would refuse to accept or pay for any linters, either on hand with the manufacturers or afterwards produced by them, and that appellant and other manufacturers could seek their remedy in the courts.\n Within the hour the committee, although protesting against the government's interpretation of the contract and the position taken by its representatives, notified them that the manufacturers would accede to the proposed modification of their contracts. On the same day the Ordnance Department gave to appellant and other manufacturers telegraphic notice of the cancellation of their contracts, and on January 2, 1919, a form of contract, embodying the verbal agreement reached between the officers of the Ordinance Department and the committee, was submitted to the appellant and the other manufacturers, accompanied by a copy of a letter of the \n\n[271 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n Ordinance Department stating that linters would not be accepted by the government from any producer who refused to execute the contract. Appellant's counsel assisted in the preparation of this letter. The form contract, dated December 31, 1919, was signed by appellant; it contained recitals of the cancellation of the earlier contract of September, 1918; that a dispute had arisen as to whether the war had terminated and as to the measure of damages provided by the cancellation clause in the earlier contract, and stipulated that the new contract was in lieu of cancellation of the earlier contract and a modification of it.\n The findings of the Court of Claims establish appellant's right to recover under the earlier contract, if it was not modified by the later one. Appellant urges that the later contract does not bar such recovery because the coercive measures resorted to by officers of the Ordinance Department, to induce its execution, amount in law to duress, rendering the second contract invalid and without force to modify the first. To support this position appellant relies on the serious consequences which the industry would have suffered if the government had wholly refused to perform its contracts. It asserts that 270,000 bales of linters already inspected by the government were in the hands of manufacturers; that a million tons of cotton seed, purchased at the uniform price of $70 fixed by the government, were on hand; that the manufacturers had made commitments for the purchase of $480,000 tons in the hands of farmers. It is contended that the government's refusal to carry out the contracts would have resulted in the failure of the scheme for the stabilization of the price of cotton seed and its products, and in the collapse of the business structure which had been reared upon the basis of the stabilized price, and that great loss would have resulted to appellant and other manufacturers.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n A difficulty encountered by the appellant at the outset is that this view is not supported by the findings made. On its own theory of the case, appellant must prove the probable injury which it would have suffered from the threatened refusal of the government to carry out its contract, and that fear of that loss was the effective cause of its executing the settlement contract. Any inference that the business of manufacturing and distributing cotton seed products would have been disastrously affected, would avail appellant nothing because it does not appear what the consequences to its own business and finances would have been.\n The findings establish that on December 30, 1918, there were in the hands of manufacturers 270,000 bales of linters; but it does not appear what proportion of them, if any, were in the hands of appellant. There is no finding with respect to the amount of cotton seed or cotton seed products in the hands of the manufacturers. There is no finding with respect to the nature or extent of the commitments of the manufacturers for the purchase of seed, or as to the nature of extent of the loss which appellant would have suffered if on December 30, 1918, the government had refused to go forward with its contract, or that the legal damages for such breach of contract would not have been adequate to compensate for its loss. There is no finding that appellant was induced to sign the settlement contract by fear of the consequences of a refusal to sign.\n In applying to the facts of this case the principles which control duress as a legal ground for avoidance of a contract, we are limited to such conclusions of law as may be drawn from the fact, found by the court below, that appellant signed the settlement contract after negotiations, in the course of which the threat was made that the government would disregard the admitted obligations of its contracts unless those entitled to the performance of \n\n[271 U.S. 43, 49]\n\u00a0\n them would yield to its demands. This threat was discreditable to the officers who made it and injurious to the government, whose high obligation to deal justly and according to law, with those with whom it had contracts, might well have been their first concern. But a threat to break a contract does not in itself constitute duress. Before the coercive effect of the threatened action can be inferred, there must be evidence of some probable consequences of it to person or property for which the remedy afforded by the courts is inadequate.

All were cases in which government contractors were called on to perform extra services, the representatives of the government taking the position that the services demanded were stipulated for by the contracts. In each it was held that the services were not contemplated by the contract, and that the contractor did not assent to the government's construction. There was consequently no legal bar to the contractor's recovering the fair value of the service rendered to the government, the Postmaster General having authority to request the services and to pay for them.

Here the appellant is confronted with the finding that it has executed a formal \n\n[271 U.S. 43, 50]\n\u00a0\n contract which bars its recovery unless it sustains the burden of proving duress.\n The objection that the contract by which the parties settled the controversy between them was without consideration is without weight.

St.  1010).\n Messrs. James J. O'Donohoe, Mark D. Eagleton, and Harry S. Rooks, all of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Robert A. Holland, Jr., and Jacob M. Lashly, both of St. Louis, Mo., for defendants in error. \n\n[271 U.S. 318, 319]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a question as to the jurisdiction of the District Court arising under the provision of section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1010) that: When there is pending in a State court any civil suit of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction, in which 'there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different States, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the District Court of the United States for the proper district.'\n The suit was brought by Hay, a citizen of Missouri, in the Circuit Court of St. Louis, against the Stores Company, a New York corporation, and McCormick, a citizen of Missouri, to recover damages for personal injuries. \n\n[271 U.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n The petition alleged that the plaintiff and McCormick were employed by the Stores Company in its place of business in Missouri, in moving loaded trucks along a tunnel or passageway on its premises; that the company negligently permitted this passageway to become strewn with de bris, and negligently required its employees to push heavily loaded trucks along the passageway, unassisted, rapidly, and at short and unsafe intervals; that McCormick, who was not a reasonably safe co-employee, habitually pushed his truck at an unsafe speed, in dangerous proximity to the preceding truck, and without exercising reasonable care to avoid a collision; that, although the company knew or by the exercise of ordinary care could have known of these dangerous and negligent habits, it negligently caused and permitted him to continue to perform his duties in this negligent and unsafe manner; that on the day of the accident, while the plaintiff was engaged in pushing a loaded truck along the passageway, it was suddenly stopped by de bris obstructing the passageway, and he was struck by a loaded truck which McCormick was negligently pushing, close behind him, at a rapid rate of speed, and which 'the defendants' negligently failed to stop or divert so as to avoid the collision; and 'that the negligence of both defendants as aforesaid concurred and jointly cooperated to cause, and did directly and proximately cause, the aforesaid collision,' from which the plaintiff sustained serious and permanent injuries, to his damage in the sum of $15,000.\n The Stores Company in due time presented to the Circuit Court its petition for the removal of the cause to the District Court. The sole ground alleged for the removal was that the plaintiff's petition showed 'upon its face' that there was 'a separable controversy' in the cause between the plaintiff and the Stores Company, citizens of different States, in that, under its allegations, \n\n[271 U.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n whatever the previous negligence of the Stores Company, the negligent failure of McCormick to stop or divert his truck so as to avoid the collision, was 'the sole proximate cause' of the collision and of the plaintiff's injuries, and that 'hence' no joint cause of action was stated against the defendants. The Circuit Court on this petition ordered the removal.\n After the record had been filed in the District Court the plaintiff filed a motion to remand the cause to the Circuit Court, on the ground that it appeared upon the face of the record that the petition for removal was insufficient and the District Court had not acquired jurisdiction of the cause. This motion was overruled; to which the plaintiff excepted. Thereafter, on motion of the Stores Company, the court ordered the plaintiff to furnish security for costs within a specified time; and upon his failure to comply with this rule, the suit was dismissed, at his costs.\n To obtain a review of the ruling on the jurisdictional question presented by the motion to remanded, the plaintiff applied for a direct writ of error from this court. This was allowed by the District Judge in February, 1925, under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215); and in that connection he duly certified for decision the single question whether, upon the record, the District Court acquired jurisdiction of the cause by the removal based upon a separable controversy. This question is now properly before us for review. Wilson v. Republic Iron Co., \n257 \nU.S. 92, 93\n, 42 S. Ct. 35.\n It is well settled by the decisions of this court, that an action brought in a State court against two defendants jointly, in which the plaintiff states a case of joint liability arising out of the concurrent negligence of the defendants, does not present a separable controversy authorizing the removal of the cause to a Federal court, even though the plaintiff might have sued the defendants separately; the allegations of the complaint being decisive as to the nature of the controversy in the absence of a showing that one \n\n[271 U.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n of the defendants was fraudulently joined for the purpose of preventing the removal.

Ct. 392.\n This rule was applied in the Dowell Case, supra, 112 (33 S. Ct. 684), where a railroad laborer, who had been run down by an engine, brought suit against the railroad company and the engineer jointly, alleging in his petition that the defective character of the engine, the unfitness and incompetency of the engineer, and his negligence and carelessness in needlessly running the engine over the plaintiff, 'concurrently and jointly contributed' to the injuries. So, in the present case, the plaintiff's petition alleged in substance that the negligence of the Stores Company in permitting the passageway to become obstructed, in requiring the employees to operate their trucks in an unsafe manner, and, specifically, in permitting McCormick, an unsafe co-employee, to handle his truck in a negligent and dangerous manner, directly concurred and jointly cooperated with McCormick's negligence in causing the plaintiff's injuries. It is clear that this petition stated on its face a case of joint liability arising from concurrent acts of negligence on the part of the defendants, cooperating to cause the injuries, and that it presented no separable controversy with the Stores Company within the established rule applicable in such cases.\n The petition of the Stores Company, therefore, the District Court, and no jurisdiction was acquired under it.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court with direction to remand it to the Circuit Court of St. Louis.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEBERT v. STATE OF LOUISIANA(1926)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: November 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. R. Mitchell, of Lake Charles, La., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Percy Saint and E. R. Schowalter, both of New Orleans, La., and John J. Robira, of Lake Charles, La., for the State of Louisiana.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Louisiana, like the United States, has a statute making it a criminal offense to manufacture intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. A judgment of the Supreme Court of the state, affirming a conviction under this statute (158 La. 209, 103 So. 742), is presented for review by this writ of error. The writ was sued out before the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, and falls within the saving clause in the last section.\n When the accusation was preferred in the state court, and when the accused were arrested thereon, they already were under indictment in the federal District Court for the same acts as an offense against the federal statute and were on bail awaiting trial in that court. When taken before the state court they interposed a plea, first, that it was without authority to entertain the accusation, because the acts charged constituted an offense against the United States of which the federal District Court was \n\n[272 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n given exclusive jurisdiction by section 256 of the federal Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1233); and, second, that, even if the accusation could be entertained, their arrest under state process while they were on bail awaiting trial in the federal District Court was in derogation of the authority of the latter, and therefore did not give jurisdiction of their persons. The plea was overruled, and this is assigned as error.\n We think the ruling was right. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution contemplates that the manufacture of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes may be denounced as a criminal offense both by the federal law and by the state law, and that these laws may not only coexist, but be given full operation, each independently of the other. Where such manufacture is thus doubly denounced, one who engages therein commits two distinct offenses, one against the United States and one against the state, and may be subjected to prosecution and punishment in the federal courts for one, and in the state courts for the other, without any infraction of the constitutional rule against double jeopardy; it being limited to repeated prosecutions 'for the same offense.' United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n, 43 S. Ct. 141.\n The provision in section 256 of the federal Judicial Code has no bearing on the authority of a state court to entertain an accusation for an offense against the state law. That provision relates to offenses 'cognizable under the authority of the United States.' Only offenses against the laws of the United States are cognizable under its authority. Those against state laws are cognizable only under the authority of the state. And this is true where the same act is an offense against both a law of the United States and a law of the state.\n An argument is advanced to the effect that the state, in denouncing the manufacture of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes as a criminal offense, and in taking proceedings to punish the offenders, is exerting a power \n\n[272 U.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n derived from the Eighteenth Amendment, and therefore that all that is done by the state in that regard must be taken as done under the authority of the United States. The same argument was advanced in United States v. Lanza, supra, and was rejected as unsound for reasons which we deem it well to repeat here:\n'To regard the amendment as the source of the power of the states to adopt and enforce prohibition measures is to take a partial and erroneous view of the matter. Save for some restrictions arising out of the federal Constitution, chiefly the commerce clause, each state possessed that power in full measure prior to the amendment, and the probable purpose of declaring a concurrent power to be in the states was to negative any possible inference that, in vesting the national government with the power of country-wide prohibition, state power would be excluded. In effect, the second section of the Eighteenth Amendment put an end to restrictions upon the state's power arising out of the federal Constitution, and left her free to enact prohibition laws applying to all transactions within her limits. To be sure, the first section of the amendment took from the states all power to authorize acts falling within its prohibition, but it did not cut down or displace prior state laws not inconsistent with it. Such laws derive their force, as do all new ones consistent with it, not from this amendment, but from power originally belonging to the states, preserved to them by the Tenth Amendment, and now relieved from the restriction heretofore arising out of the federal Constitution. This is the ratio decidendi of our decision in Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, \n258 U.S. 403\n (42 S. Ct. 330).'\n\n It, of course, was essential that the state court have jurisdiction of the persons of the accused. In fact, they were before it, and were accorded full opportunity to defend. In the absence of any showing to the contrary, and there is none, it properly may be assumed that the \n\n[272 U.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n United States acquiesced in their arrest and trial on the accusation under the state law, notwithstanding they were then on bail awaiting trial in the federal court on the indictment pending there. Certainly, if the United States was not objecting, the fact that the accused were thus on bail awaiting trial in the federal court presented no obstacle to the arrest under the process of the state court as a means of acquiring jurisdiction of their persons. Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 \nU.S. 254, 260\n, 42 S. Ct. 309, 22 A. L. R. 879; Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 25 S. Ct. 573; Peckham v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 483, 486\n, 30 S. Ct. 255.\n The accused also assign error on a ruling respecting the maximum period of imprisonment admissible under the state law. Two statutes were involved. The accused took the position that one was special and excluded the other. But the trial court rejected that view, construed the statutes as intended to be taken together, and as a result imposed a more burdensome sentence than was named in the statute which the accused thought controlling. The Supreme Court sustained that construction, and the accused contend here, as they did in that court, that the construction was wrong, and, being wrong, operated as a denial of due process of law in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment. The contention must be overruled. Whether state statutes shall be construed one way or another is a state question, the final decision of which rests with the courts of the state. The due process of law clause in the Fourteenth Amendment does not take up the statutes of the several states and make them the test of what it requires; nor does it enable this court to revise the decisions of the state courts on questions of state law. What it does require is that state action, whether through one agency or another, shall be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions and not infrequently are designated as 'law of the \n\n[272 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n land.' Those principles are applicable alike in all the states, and do not depend upon or vary with local legislation. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 682\n, 683 S., 18 S. Ct. 229; West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258, 261\n, 263 S., 24 S. Ct. 650; Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 459\n, 27 S. Ct. 556, 10 Ann. Cas. 689; Pullman Co. v. Knott, \n235 \nU.S. 23, 25\n, 35 S. Ct. 2; Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 166\n, 37 S. Ct. 318. The Supreme Court of the state having held that the two statutes must be taken together in determining the penalty intended, we must accept that conclusion as if written into the statutes themselves. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 73\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160. All that would be open in this court under the due process clause is whether the state had power to impose the penalty fixed by the statutes as thus construed. Rawlins v. Georgia, \n201 \nU.S. 638, 640\n, 26 S. Ct. 560, 5 Ann. Cas. 783. That the state had such power is not questioned, but only that the statutes rightly construed show that the power has been exercised. On this question, as we have said, the decision of the Supreme Court of the state is controlling.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENKELS v. SUTHERLAND(1926)\nNo. 318\nArgued: Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Herbert R. Limberg, Morris J. Hirsch, Henry L. Sherman, and Harry F. Mela, all of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Ira Lloyd Letts, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Dean Hill Stanley, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity, under section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411, 419, as amended by c. 6, 41 Stat. 35 and c. 241, 41 Stat. 977 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2 e), brought by Henkels, a citizen of the United States, in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, to \n\n[271 U.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n recover the proceeds of the sale of 2,298 shares of common stock of International Textile, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, theretofore seized by the Alien Property Custodian upon the claim that it was the property of an alien enemy. A decree was rendered in Henkels' favor, adjudging him to be the sole owner of the stock, and the Treasurer of the United States was directed to account for, and pay over to Henkels, the proceeds of the sale 'together with the income or interest, if any, earned thereon.' There was realized from the sale of the stock, made on March 26, 1919, after deducting expenses, a balance of $1,505,052.55. This amount the Treasurer paid to Henkels. Subsequently Henkels applied to the District Court to name a master to take and state the account of interest or income earned upon the fund prior to its payment. The application was denied and a final decree of dismissal entered upon the ground that the principal sum had been paid in Henkels, who had executed a release and satisfaction in full which the court refused to set aside on the claim of duress. Henkels v. Miller, 298 F. 947. Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, without passing upon this ground, held that the United States was not liable for income resulting from an investment of the funds in its own securities. Henkels v. Miller, 4 F.(2d) 988.\n The proceeds arising from the sale of the stock were deposited with the Treasurer in conformity with law, and by that officer they were commingled with the proceeds of other sales of alien property and invested in interest-bearing securities of the United States. The government admits Henkels' right to recover income earned on the corporate shares prior to their sale, but denies his right to recover for interest actually paid on government securities in which the proceeds had been invested. This presents the only question for our determination, the government having expressly waived the point upon which the District Court decided the case. \n\n[271 U.S. 298, 300]\n\u00a0\n No question is made in respect of the right of the Custodian to seize property supposed to belong to an enemy, although it may subsequently turn out to have been a mistake, adequate provision having been made for a return in that case. Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 556\n, 41 S. Ct. 214; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 41 S. Ct. 293.\n By Executive Order No. 2813 of February 26, 1918, made pursuant to law, moneys deposited with the Treasurer by the Custodian are to be held by the Secretary of the Treasury 'for account of the Alien Property Custodian,' and may be invested and reinvested from time to time in bonds or United States certificates of indebtedness. All moneys so deposited, together with interest or income received from the investment thereof, are made subject to withdrawal by the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of making payments pursuant to the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, which would include, of course, payments under section 9(a).\n Section 9(a) authorizes a suit in equity by any person not an enemy, etc., to determine a claim to any interest, right or title in the property seized. If, in the meantime, the seized property has been sold, the same remedy, by section 7(c), as amended, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 d), becomes available 'against the net proceeds received therefrom and held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.' No distinction in this respect is made between the property and its proceeds. It cannot be doubted that, if the seized property had been securities of the United States and these, thereafter, had been held in their original form, maturing coupons for interest would have belonged to the American claimant equally with the body of the bonds. In principle, there can be no difference between such a case and the one here, where claimant's property had been converted into securities of the United States. Such securities constitute the statutory 'net proceeds,' and, by the clear import of the \n\n[271 U.S. 298, 301]\n\u00a0\n statute, claimant's rights in respect of such proceeds are not inferior to his rights in respect of the original property. And no distinction fairly can be made between the accumulated interest upon securities constituting the proceeds, in the one case, and like securities constituting the property, in the other.\n The government cannot be sued without its consent, and accordingly it cannot be sued for interest unless it consents to be liable therefor. But the claim here is not for interest to be paid by the United States in the sense of the rule. It is for income, derived from an investment of Henkels' money in obligations of the United States, which income has been actually received by the Treasury and is in its possession, to be held, as the proceeds themselves are to be held, for the account of the Alien Property Custodian.\n With enemy-owned property seized by the Custodian, it has been held, the United States may deal as it sees fit, White v. Mechanics' Securities Corporation, \n269 \nU.S. 283\n, 46 S. Ct. 116 (decided December 14, 1925); but it has no such latitude in respect of the property of an American citizen. Whether the government shall pay interest upon its obligations depends upon congressional assent; but it cannot confiscate the actual increment of property belonging to a citizen, or the increment of the proceeds into which such property has been converted, any more than it can confiscate the property or its proceeds, without coming into conflict with the Constitution.\n The government contends that Angarica v. Bayard, \n127 \nU.S. 251\n, 8 S. Ct. 1156, is to the contrary, and the court below so held. In that case, the suit was for interest or income realized upon the amount of an award in favor of Angarica paid by the Spanish government to the United States. This court, in denying the right of recovery, applied the general rule of immunity from interest, saying (pages 259, 260 (8 S. Ct. 1160)) that the claim 'is not different in char- \n\n[271 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n acter from what it would have been if, instead of being a claim for increment or income actually received by the United States, it were a claim for interest generally, or for increment or income which the United States would or might have received by the exercise of proper care in the investment of the money.' Without challenging the correctness of this view as applied to the precise facts of that case, it cannot be accepted as a rule of general application. Especially, it cannot be accepted as applicable here, where the property of a citizen has been mistakenly seized, and, by executive authority, after conversion into money, has been invested in government securities. We cannot bring ourselves to agree that a direction to invest such money in securities of the United States, rather than in other securities, may be utilized to enable the government unjustly to enrich itself at the expense of its citizens, by appropriating income actually earned and received, which morally and equitably belongs to them as plainly as though they had themselves made the investment.\n Since the proceeds resulting from the sale of Henkels' property have been commingled with the proceeds of other sales and thus invested, an account must be taken to ascertain the average rate of interest received by the Treasury upon all the proceeds invested and thereupon, after deducting proper charges and expenses and taking into consideration the average amount of such proceeds which remained uninvested in the Treasury, a proportionate allocation made in respect of the proceeds belonging to Henkels for the period of their investment.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Harry L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant seeks to establish an interest in certain lands allotted to Little Soldier, a Ponca Indian, under the General Allotment Act of 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, as amended by the Act of 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 794. Trust \n\n[270 U.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n patents were issued therefor in 1895, and he died March 1, 1919. It appears from the bill that the Secretary of the Interior after due consideration determined who were the heirs and in doing so eliminated appellant, although she claimed to be the only surviving lawful wife. It is alleged that upon the facts found by him the Secretary misapplied the law\n The court below held, correctly we think, that it was without jurisdiction since the matter had been intrusted to the exclusive cognizance of the Secretary of the Interior by the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, s 1, 36 Stat. 855 (Comp. St. s 4226), which provides:\n'That when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period and before the issuance of a fee simple patent, without having made a will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing, under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the legal heirs of such decedent, and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.'\n\n The question presented must be regarded as settled by what this court has said in Hallowell v. Commons, 36 S. Ct. 202, \n239 U.S. 506\n; Lane v. Mickadiet, 36 S. Ct. 599, \n241 U.S. 201\n; United States v. Bowling, 41 S. Ct. 561, \n256 U.S. 484\n. The legislative history of the Act of 1910-Cong. Rec. vol. 45, p. 5811- lends support to this construction; and abundant reason for the provision becomes apparent upon consideration of the infinite difficulties which otherwise would arise in connection with the sundry duties of the Secretary of the Interior relative to Indian allotments.\n We cannot accept the suggestion that the above-quoted exclusive feature of the Act of 1910, was repealed by the Act of December 21, 1911, c. 5, 37 Stat. 46, which amended section 24, Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 991), and conferred upon District Courts jurisdiction 'of all actions, suits, or proceedings involving the right of any person, in whole or in part of Indian \n\n[270 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n blood or descent, to any allotment of land under any law or treaty.' This paragraph is but a codification of provisions found in the Act of August 15, 1894, c. 290, 28 Stat. 305, as amended by the Act of February 6, 1901, c. 217, 31 Stat. 760 (Comp. St. ss 4214, 4215). It has reference to original allotments claimed under some law or treaty, and not to disputes concerning the heirs of one who held a valid and unquestioned allotment.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOME FURNITURE CO. v.

By a bill presented to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, they sought annulment of an Interstate Commerce Commission order, which permitted acquisition of control over the Southewestern System by the Southern Pacific Company.\n They alleged:\n That the Southern Pacific Company is a corporation under the laws of Kentucky, which operates reilroads in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and other states.\n'That defendant El. Paso & Southwestern Railroad Company is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Arizona and is authorized to and does operate railroads in the state of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas; that said defendant is engaged in the transportation of passengers and property in interstate commerce subject to the Interstate Commerce Act; that defendant is part of what is known as the El Paso & Southwestern Railway System, consisting of the following railroad companies, viz.: The El Paso & Southwestern Railroad Company, the El Paso & Southwestern Railroad of Texas, the Burro Mountain Railroad Company, the Arizona & New Mexico Railway Company, the Dawson Railway \n\n[271 U.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n Company, the El Paso & Northeastern Railway Company, the El Paso & Rock Island Railway Company, the Alamogordo & Sacramento Mountain Railway Company, the El Paso & Northeastern Railroad Company, and the Tucson, Phoenix & Tide Water Railway Company, hereinafter, for convenience sake, referred to as the Southwestern System; that all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and a portion of the outstanding bonds of the companies comprising said System are owned directly or indirectly by the El Paso & Southwestern Company, a holding corporation of the state of New Jersey; that of the railway companies comprising said system only the defendant El Paso & Southwestern Railroad Company is engaged in the transportation of passengers and property in interstate commerce, which said company, in addition to operating the lines of railway owned, by it, operates under lease all of the existing railways of the remaining companies comprising said system.'\n\n'That the Southern Pacific Company and the El Paso & Southwestern Railroad Company, on July 1, 1924, petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order approving the former's proposal to acquire control of the Southwestern System by stock ownership and through leases.\n\n That, on September 30, 1924, the Commission approved the proposal.\n That they will be injured, by the proposed control, through loss of opportunity to route their goods over either of two competing systems, and the depreciation of service and increase of rates which will naturally result from suppression of competition. The gravamen is that transportation facilities, service, and charges will be adversely affected by the union of the two systems under one management.\n Appellees denied jurisdiction of the court and asked dismissal of the bill. They set up, by plea:\n\n\n[271 U.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n That the venue of the suit upon said alleged cause of action does not lie in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Texas, but, on the contrary, said venue lies, if the suit is maintainable at all, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Arizona or for the District of Kentucky, as complainants may elect to file their bill in either of said districts, for the following reasons, to wit: Because it affirmatively appears from the fact of complainants' bill heretofore filed herein that Southern Pacific Company, a corporation of the state of Kentucky, having its domicile in said state of Kentucky, and El Paso & Southwestern Railroad Company, a corporation of the state of Arizona, having its domicile in said state of Arizona, were the parties upon whose petition the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission sought to be reviewed and set aside in this proceeding was made, and because it further appears from the said bill of complainants that the said order relates to transportation and was made upon the petition of the parties aforesaid.\n This plea was sustained January 15, 1925 (2 F.(2d) 765), and the cause is here by direct appeal. Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220. Decision of the question at issue must turn upon the proper construction and application of the following provision of that act (38 Stat. 219, 220 (Comp. St.  994)):\n'The venue of any suit hereafter brought to enforce, suspend, or set aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be in the judicial district wherein is the residence of the party or any of the parties upon whose petition the order was made, except that where the order does not relate to transportation or is not made upon the petition of any party the venue shall be in the district where the matter complained of in the petition before the Commission arises, and except that where the order does not relate either to transportation \n\n[271 U.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n or to a matter so complained of before the Commission the matter covered by the order shall be deemed to arise in the district where one of the petitioners in court has either its principal office of its principal operating office. In case such transportation relates to a through shipment the term 'destination' shall be construed as meaning final destination of such shipment.'\n\n The language of this provision was not happily chosen, but, when consideration is given to the situation of the complaining parties here, the gravamen of their bill, and the report of the Commission, we think it becomes sufficiently clear that its order has direct relation to transportation, within the meaning of the statute.\n The Commission found:\n The lines of the Southwestern System are intermediate between the lines of the Southern Pacific, and the lines of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway System, hereinafter called the Rock Island. The lines of the three systems constitute one of the principal direct routes between southern California and the Missouri River and Chicago, and are included in the Southern Pacific-Rock Island System in the grouping of railroads under the tentative plan for consolidation of railroad properties promulgated by us under date of August 3, 1921. Consolidation of Railroad Properties, 6o Interst. Com. Com'n R. 455. Acquisition of control of the Southwestern System by the Southern Pacific is in harmony with this plan. It will result in direct physical connection between the lines of the Southern Pacific and the Rock Island, will assure the continuance of this route, and will increase its competitive strength as compared with the routes of the Sants Fe and Union Pacific. While the lines of the Southern Pacific and Southwestern System west of El Paso may be said to be parallel, they serve different communities and industrial sections. The points at which the two systems meet are important points of interchange \n\n[271 U.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n of a large traffic to and from communities served by one but not the other. Better co-ordination and more efficient and economical operation will follow as to this traffic and as to transcontinental traffic in connection with the Rock Island, and relations to the traveling and shipping public and to public authorities will be simplified and improved.\n The challenged order was made upon a petition, and neither party thereto resides within the Western District of Texas. It related to transportation. Consequently the court below was without jurisdiction. See Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 563\n, 39 S. Ct. 375. Moreover, the bill alleged no probable direct legal injury to appellants except such as might arise out of changed conditions in respect of transportation to and from the city of El Paso. Accordingly, they had no proper cause of complaint unless the order had definite relation to transportation. Hines, etc. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 44 S.

McGinnis, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles Bunn, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners were indicted in the District Court of Western Pennsylvania for conspiracy to use and for using the mails to defraud, crimes punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both (sections 37, 215 Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201, 10385)). On pleas of nolo contendere they were sentenced to imprisonment for one year and one day. The conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 9 F. (2d) 825. The case is here on certiorari. \n271 \nU.S. 652\n, 46 S. Ct. 474; Judicial Code,  240(a), as amended ( Comp. St.  1217).\n The sole question raised by the assignment of error is whether a United States court, after accepting a plea of nolo contendere, may impose a prison sentence. It is the contention of petitioners that the plea in effect is conditioned upon the imposition of a lighter penalty; that \n\n[272 U.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n therefore the court may not accept the plea to an indictment charging a crime punishable by imprisonment only, and if accepted, where the crime is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both, it may not accept the plea and ignore the condition by imposing a prison sentence. This contention is supported by Tucker v. United States (C. C. A. 7th) 196 F. 260, 116 C. C. A. 62, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 70, Shapiro v. United States (C. C. A. 7th) 196 F. 268, 116 C. C. A. 70, Blum v. United States (C. C. A. 7th) 196 F. 269, 116 C. C. A. 71, in which sentences of imprisonment on the plea of nolo contendere were set aside. But in United States v. Lair (C. C. A. 8th) 195 F. 47, 115 C. C. A. 49, habeas corpus was denied a prisoner confined for a two-year term upon this plea, but the objection pressed here apparently was neither raised nor considered. The state courts have rejected the contention when made. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The use of the plea in the federal courts and the propriety of imposing a prison sentence upon it are recognized by the Probation Act. Act March 4, 1925, c. 521, 43 Stat. 1259 (Comp. St.  10564 4\/5-10564 4\/5 c). Section 1 of that Act provides for the suspension of sentence and the release of the prisoner on probation 'after \n\n[272 U.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for any crime or offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment.'\n The plea of nolo contendere was known to the common law, and is referred to, although not by name, by a modern English text-writer. See Archbold's Pleading, Evidence, and Practice in Criminal Cases (26th Ed., 1922) 379. But no example of its use in the English courts has been found since the case of Queen v. Templeman (decided in 1702) 1 Salk. 55, where, although a fine was imposed, the question now under consideration was neither decided nor discussed.\n The view of the court in the Tucker Case, that a prison sentence may not be imposed on the plea of nolo contendere, rests upon no more substantial basis than a possibly ambiguous phrase in a passage from Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (8th Ed.) book 2, c. 31, p. 466. The author prefaces the chapter, 'Of Confessions and Demurrer,' with the remark:\n'And now I am to consider what is to be done to a prisoner upon his confession, which may be either express or implied.'\n\n In sections 1 and 2, he points out that a confession of guilt-\n'carries with it so strong a presumption of guilt that an entry on record, 'quod cognovit indictamentum,' etc., in an indictment of trespass, estops the defendant to plead 'not guilty' to an action brought afterwards against him for the same matter.'\n\n He then says:\n'Sec. 3. An implied confession is where a defendant, in a case not capital, doth not directly own himself guilty, but in a manner admits it by yielding to the king's mercy, and desiring to submit to a small fine: in which case, if the court think fit to accept of such submission, and make an entry that the defendant posuit se in gratiam regis, without putting him to a direct confession, or plea (which in such cases seems to be left to discretion), the defendant shall not be estopped to plead not guilty to an action for the same fact, as he shall be where the entry is quod cognovit indictamentum.' \n\n[272 U.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n This passage appears in all the earlier editions of Hawkins. It has been handed down from generation to generation of text-writers in substantially the same form, with occasional glosses, but researches rarely went further. \n2\n Similarly judicial study of the history of the plea halts with Hawkins.\n\n The author, neither here nor elsewhere, fulfills his promise 'to consider what is to be done to a prisoner upon his confession.' It is to be noted that this and the preceding sections are directed only to the effect of the confession, whether express or implied, as an estoppel. He does not undertake to state with any certainty the precise effect of the implied confession upon the sentence. Putting oneself on the mercy of the king seems to have been at least an appeal for merey, and at most a consent \n\n[272 U.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n to be fined, if let off with that-not a plea, but a petition, the rejection of which may possibly have required a plea. The text states the rule of law that has never been questioned that the implied confession, as contrasted to the express confession, does not estop the defendant to plead and prove his innocence in a civil action.\n But, even if we regard the implied confession as a petition which in Hawkins' time had to be accepted as tendered, in modern practice it has been transformed into the formal plea of nolo contendere. Like the implied confession, this plea does not create an estoppel; but, like the plea of guilty, it is an admission of guilt for the purposes of the case. Section 3, it is true, speaks of the defendant's yielding to mercy and his desire 'to submit to a small fine,' but, even if we assign to these words the more comprehensive meaning suggested, they do not say that the court is bound to yield to the prisoner's petition in fixing sentence, nor do they suggest that the court, by accepting a formal plea which admits guilt for the purposes of the case, would be bound to yield to its implied appeal for mercy.\n The genesis of the phrase 'desiring to submit to a small fine,' used by Hawkins, indicates unmistakably that its purpose was illustrative only. The authorities cited by Hawkins are Lambard's Eirenarcha, book 4, c. 9; 9 Hen. VI. 60; 11 Hen. IV. 65; 1 Fitzherbert, Gr. Abr. Estoppel, par. 24. The pertinent passage in Lambard is:\n'... As where he putteth himselfe in Gratiam Reginae, & petit admitti per finem, without any more, or (by Protestation that he is not guilty) pleadeth his pardon; and such a Confession (if I may so call it) doth not so conclude him, but that he may afterward plead Not guiltie in any Action brought against him. ...' Page 506.\n\n The authorities cited, as in Hawkins, are 9 Hen. VI, 60, and 11 Hen. IV, 65. In the same chapter, Lambard, in a passage for which no counterpart is found in Hawkins, \n\n[272 U.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n unless it be the phrase already considered, queries whether the justices may reject the plea and in consequence 'drive the party either to an absolute confession (for increase of the fine) or to his traverse, that ( failing therein) he may be imprisoned and fined also.' But this query leaves it uncertain whether the reduction of sentence following the implied confession is a matter of right upon which the prisoner may insist, or discretionary with the court.\n Of the reports from the year books cited both by Hawkins and Lambard, 11 Hen. IV deals with express confessions. The extract from 9 Hen. VI is a colloquy between counsel and the court. The translation is printed in the margin. \n3\n Its effect is that if one, indicted for trespass, has 'put himself on the grace of our Lord and King and asked that he might be allowed to pay a fine (petit se admitti per finem),' his plea, if accepted, does not estop him from afterwards pleading not guilty. We have here the same illustration used by Hawkins and Lambard properly applied, as the case was one of trespass, but there is no suggestion that would warrant the conclusion that a court, by the mere acceptance of the plea of nolo contendere, would be limited to a fine in fixing sentence. Fitzherbert merely digests this year book case. A cita- \n\n[272 U.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n tion to Farresly, 40, added in the later editions of Hawkins, is the case of Queen v. Templeman in Salkeld to which reference has already been made.\n We think it clear, therefore, that the contention now pressed upon us not only fails of support in judicial decisions other than those of the seventh circuit already noticed, but its historical background is too meager and inconclusive to be persuasive in leading us to adopt the limitation as one recognized by the common law.\n Undoubtedly a court may, in its discretion, mitigate the punishment on a plea of nolo contendere and feel constrained to do so whenever the plea is accepted with the understanding that only a fine is to be imposed. But such a restriction made mandatory upon the court by positive rule of law would only hamper its discretion and curtail the utility of the plea.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The precise question has rarely been raised. The contention now considered was explicitly rejected in Commonwealth v. Ferguson, 44 Pa. Super. Ct. 626. In most cases, however, the courts have ordered imprisonment on pleas of nolo contendere without discussing the matter. Commonwealth v. Holstine, 132 Pa. 357, 19 A. 273; State ex rel. Peacock v. Judges, 46 N. J. Law, 112; Philpot v. State, 65 N. H. 250, 20 A. 955; In re Lanni (R. I.) 131 A. 52, 927. State v. Burnett, 174 N. C. 796, 93 S. E. 473, L. R. A. 1918A, 955, may be cited as more than inferentially recognizing the power to impose a prison sentence since the court expressly considered its authority to order imprisonment, after having granted a suspended sentence upon this plea. The plea has of course been received in prosecutions for offenses punishable by fine only, without any intimations being made that its use is restricted to such cases, Young v. People, 53 Colo. 251, 125 P. 117; State v. Hopkins, 4 Boyce (Del.) 306, 88 A. 473; and accepted on charges punishable by both fine and imprisonment and a fine only imposed, Williams v. State, 130 Miss. 827, 94 So. 882. In Inninois, Indiana, and Minnesota the plea is not allowed. See People v. Miller, 264 Ill. 148, 154, 106 N. E. 191, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 1240; Mahoney v. State (Ind.) 149 N. E. 444, 447; State v. Kiewel, 166 Minn. 302, 207 N. W. 646, 647. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Comyns in his Digest, under Indictment, c. K, at page 513 of the 1765 edition, 'Confessions,' draws the same distinction between the two types of confessions and cites as his sole authority, 9 Hen. VI, 60. Viner similarly considers the different effects of the pleas as estoppels. Abridgment (2d Ed., 1792) vol. 10, 'Estoppel,' pp. 435, 436. Burn practically quotes Hawkins, who is his only authority. Justice of the Peace (5th Ed., 1758) 'confession,' 149, 150. This passage is still printed in the thirtieth edition of 1869, edited by J. B. Maule. Chitty, relying upon Hawkins, Comyns, Burn, and the case of Queen v. Templeman, supra, makes no further contribution. The Criminal Law (1819) vol. 1, p. 431. In Jervis' twelfth edition of Archbold (1853) the effect of the plea upon an indictment for misdemeanor is described, the passage intimating that its only use is in such crimes. No authority for the restriction is offered other than Hawkins, who merely limited the use to 'a case not capital.' This passage is repeated in all the later editions and is the same as that in the twenty-sixth edition already cited. Gabbett, Criminal Law (1843) 320, 1 Colby, Criminal Law (1868) 287, and Clark, Criminal Procedure (1895) 374, to cite a few of the standard treatises of that century with no pretension of completeness, rely upon Hawkins essentially for their historical data. As for the more modern texts, 2 Wharton Criminal Procedure (10th Ed., 1918)  1346, adds nothing, and 2 Bishop, New Criminal Procedure (2d Ed., 1913),  802, limits the availability of the plea to light misdemeanors. The encyclopedias and dictionaries go back to Hawkins and indicate the variations of state court decisions. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Weston.

Yes; certainly.\n\n'Which was agreed by all the Court.\n\n'Weston. It is of record that he admitted it.\n\n'Babbington. If the entry be so, he will be estopped; but the entry is not so, but is thus, that he put himself on the grace of our Lord, the King, and asked that he might be allowed to pay a fine (petit se admitti per finem). (The folio reads 'admittit,' obviously a mistake.) Therefore, if one be indicted for felony, and has a charter of pardon, and pleads it, and prays that it be allowed, this does not prove that he is guilty; but the King has excluded himself (from claiming guilty) by his charter. And I and all the Court are against you on this point.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUGHES BROS. TIMBER CO. v.

Bailey, and Oscar Mitchell, and of Duluth, Minn., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James E. Markham, Clifford Hilton, and G. A. Youngquist, all of St. Paul, Minn., and H. H. Phelps, of Glendale, Cal., for State of Minnesota.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a special proceeding in the district court of Cook county, Minnesota, by the state, through the county treasurer, to collect taxes on personal property owned by the Hughes Bros. Timber Company. With the penalty and fees and costs, the amount sued for was $2,919.50. The amount claimed by items appeared in a delinquent list furnished by the treasurer to the sheriff of the county for collection for the year 1922. It included a tax upon 10,000 cords of pulp wood of the assessed value of $21,233. In its answer as amended, the timber company pleaded that the pulp wood was not subject to taxation in the state of Minnesota at the time it was assessed, May 1, 1922, but was at that time in actual transit in interstate commerce by continuous route from the state of Minnesota to the state of Michigan. This presents the only question in the case.\n The issue was submitted, without a jury, to the district court which found that the wood was not being carried in interstate commerce. The result was a judgment against the timber company for $2,456.78, including a penalty. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that the judgment of the District Court was wrong in the penalty imposed, because the defendants had not been given opportunity to pay the correct amount of the taxes, but with this modification affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 163 Minn. 4, 203 N. W. 436. The case is here by certiorari granted October 12, 1925. \n269 \nU.S. 542\n, 46 S. Ct. 22. \n\n[272 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n The Timber Company was a partnership, having its office headquarters at Hovland, Cook county, Minn. The Swamp river flows through the county and empties into the Pigeon river. The latter forms the boundary between Cook county, Minn., and the province of Ontario, Canada, and empties into Lake Superior. The timber company's pulp wood was cut and gathered at various places in the county, but was hauled to the Swamp river and piled up on the ice and on its banks at a point about two miles and a half above its discharge into the Pigeon river. In October, 1921, the Timber Company had made a contract with the Central Paper Company, of Muskegon, Mich. By that contract the timber company agreed to deliver to the paper company, over the rail of the paper company's vessels at the mouth of the Pigeon river, approximately 10,000 cords of spruce pulp wood. The timber company agreed to load the wood into them as promptly as possible after its arrival. The paper company was to give to the timber company three days' notice of the arrival of its vessels at the booms where the logs were held, The wood was to be scaled and measured by a representative of both parties when the first cargo was loaded, and also on arrival at Muskegon, Mich., the measurement at Muskegon to be the basis for final settlement. The price per cord was to be $12. The paper company agreed to make progress estimates or provisional measurements during the months of January, February, and March at river landings, and an advance of $3 per cord for all wood inspected and measured, its inspector to be properly assisted by the timber company. The title to the wood on which advances were made was to be in the name of the paper company and to be branded at the time of provisional inspection and measurement. The paper company agreed to advance the second 25 per cent. or $3 per cord when the wood was delivered in the Pigeon river booms, and the balance, or $6 a cord, within five days after its delivery at Muskegon. \n\n[272 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n Liability insurance, was to be carried and paid by the timber company, and cargo insurance was to be carried and paid for by the paper company. There was a warranty of title and freedom from all incumbrances by the timber company.\n The hauling and placing of the logs on the ice and on the banks of the Swamp river were completed the latter part of March. When the ice broke, April 29, 1922, the drive of the logs began; those on the ice moved of themselves, and those on the banks were pushed in. The drive was conducted by the timber company's men. It had lasted 18 days when the logs reached the Pigeon river booms. By the latter part of July, all the logs had been shipped by vessels of the paper company on the lake to Muskegon.\n We do not think it important, for purposes of this case, to decide where the title to the timber was at the time the drive began. The paper company had an interest in the timber and so had the timber company. Although the point was at first made by the timber company that the logs were not taxable in the name of the timber company May 1, 1922, the day fixed as the tax day, that point is not pressed. The contract and the method of complying with it are all circumstances, however, throwing light on the question whether the transportation in interstate commerce began at the beginning of the drive when the ice broke up or at the point of loading on the lake.\n The timber company was under contract to float the timber down from the place of piling on the Swamp river and deliver it as promptly as possible. The paper company by payment of $3 a ton had acquired a qualified ownership in the timber, even before it was segregated and put to float. Had the timber company or some one claiming under it attempted to stop the drive after it had begun, and interfered with the passage of the timber \n\n[272 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n down the Swamp or Pigeon river, it would have been a breach of the contract of sale. All this characterizes what was being done in the drive between the Swamp river entrepot and the mouth of the Pigeon river, That was the beginning or first leg of the interstate journey. The obligations of both parties accorded with that view. The change in the method of transportation by floating to carriage on a vessel did not affect the continuity of the interstate passage, if such a passage was intended by the parties and had begun, any more than did shipment by local railroad bills of lading from a point in a state to a port of the same state, for shipment by vessel to a foreign port, prevent its being interstate or foreign commerce.

Ct. 485.\n The case seems to us to come within the ruling of this court in the case of Champlain Co. v. Town of Brattleboro, \n260 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S. Ct. 146, 25 A. L. R. 1195. That was a tax case like this. There the owner had cut pulp wood in several towns in Vermont. The wood was placed upon the banks of the West river and its tributaries, to be floated down into the Connecticut river and thence to its destination at the mill of the owner in Hinsdale, on the New Hampshire side of the river. Four thousand of the cords had been floated down the West river on the high water, and reached a boom at the mouth of the West river; but it was thought not safe, in view of the high water, then to let the wood into the Connecticut. It was contended that the logs which were held in the boom at the mouth of the West river were taxable there. We held otherwise; that the interstate journey of the logs had already begun when \n\n[272 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n the boom was reached; that the boom was not a depot for the gathering of logs preparatory for the final journey; that it was a safety appliance in the course of the final journey, a harbor of refuge from danger to a shipment on its way; that it was not used by the owner for any beneficial purpose of his own except to facilitate the safe delivery of the wood in New Hampshire on the other side of the Connecticut river.\n This court distinguished the facts in that case from the facts in the main case discussed in Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517\n, 6 S. Ct. 475, as they can be distinguished here. It is clear that the entrepot or depot for the interstate shipment of logs was in the Swamp river. The drive in the two rivers, though under the direction of the timber company, was not gathering the logs for subsequent interstate shipment, it was the interstate movement itself. Both parties intended interstate shipment, they had bound themselves to it, the logs were segregated and were moving in the contemplated journey which neither could prevent if they carried out their agreement. The delays in the continuity of movement were only incidental to the journey and the necessary change in the mode of transportation by which the logs were carried from a place in one state to a place agreed upon in another.\n The conclusion in cases like this must be determined from the various circumstances. Mere intention by the owner ultimately to send the logs out of the state does not put them in interstate commerce, nor does preparatory gathering for that purpose at a depot. It must appear that the movement for another state has actually begun and is going on. Solution is easy when the shipment has been delivered to a carrier for a destination in another state. It is much more difficult when the owner retains complete control of the transportation and can change his mind and divert the delivery from the intended interstate destination as in the Champlain Company Case. The character of the shipment in such a case de- \n\n[272 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n pends upon all the evidential circumstances looking to what the owner has done in the preparation for the journey and in carrying it out. The mere power of the owner to divert the shipment already stated does not take it out of interstate commerce if the other facts show that the journey has already begun in good faith and temporary interruption of the passage is reasonable and in furtherance of the intended transportation, as in the Champlain Case. Here the case is even stronger in that the owner and initiator of the journey could not by his contract divert the logs after they had started from Swamp river without a breach of contract made by him with his vendee who by the agreement of sale divided with him the responsibility for the continuous interstate transportation.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nI. T. S. RUBBER CO. v. ESSEX RUBBER CO.(1926)\nNo. 36\nArgued: April 13, 1926Decided: April 13, 1926\n\n\nDecided, Nov. 22, 1926.\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 429, 431]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. O. Richey, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Lucius E. Varney, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the I. T. S. Rubber Company against the Essex Rubber Company in the Federal District Court for Massachusetts, for the infringement of United States patent No. 14,049, on resilient heels, reissued to the I. T. S. Company January 11, 1916, as assignee, on an original patent to John G. Tufford, issued in 1914. After final hearing on the pleadings and proof1 the bill was dismissed by the District Court for want of infringement. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 1 F.(2d) 780. And there being a conflict of opinion with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as to the scope of the patent, this writ of certiorari was granted.\n The Essex Company, which manufactures and sells the heels alleged to infringe, expressly admitted the validity of the reissued patent. And the only questions are: First, whether it is estopped to deny infringement; second, if not, whether infringement is shown.\n\n 1. \nIn the courts below the I. T. S. Company relied on estoppels by reason of adjudications in various prior suits brought by it in the Sixth Circuit against dealers in the Essex Company's heels. In the brief for the I. T. S. Company in this Court it is asserted, in general terms, that the action of the Essex Company 'in suits brought against its jobbers in the Sixth Circuit estop it from denying in- \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 432]\n\u00a0\n fringement here' and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that it was not estopped by the decrees in such suits. The argument in the brief, however, specifies and deals with only one of such prior suits; and there being as to the others no semblance of compliance with the requirements of rule 25 of this Court,2 we need consider only the suit specifically relied on.\n That was a suit brought by the I. T. S. Company against one Wendt, a dealer in Essex heels of a type involved in the present suit, in which infringement of the patent was adjudged. The I. T. S. Company contends that the Essex Company, although not a party of record, took entire control of the defense, participated in the suit until the final decree, paid all the expenses, and is now estopped from denying infringement as therein adjudged.\n The material facts found by the District Court are: The Essex Company, after being notified by Wendt of the commencement of the suit, notified the counsel of the I. T. S. Company that it did not wish to, and would not, appear. Wendt thereafter voluntarily allowed the suit to go by default, and an order was entered taking the bill pro confesso. This was followed by an interlocutory decree pro confesso adjudging the infringement of the patent and Wendt's liability for damages and profits, and ordering an accounting. Down to the entry of this decree the Essex Company exercised no control over the management and conduct of the suit. Thereafter the Essex Company, having previously written Wendt that it would reimburse \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 433]\n\u00a0\n him for any losses he sustained by reason of the suit, suggested that he and counsel whom it had employed procure an adjustment of the damages and profits. Wendt and the counsel for the Essex Company thereupon secured an agreement to settle the case by Wendt's payment of $1,000. This was embodied in a stipulation signed by the I. T. S. Company's counsel and by the Essex Company's counsel as counsel for Wendt, and filed in the case. This stipulation, with the interlocutory decree, was thereafter made the basis of a final decree, readjudging the infringement, reciting the settlement, and adjudging that the I. T. S. Company recover of Wendt $1, 000 and the costs of the suit. Wendt paid this judgment and was reimbursed by the Essex Company. The District Count further found specifically that, under the circumstances, the Essex Company did not control the suit; and held that, even though the I. T. S. Company understood that the counsel negotiating the settlement represented the Essex Company as well as Wendt in adjusting the damages, it was not estopped from contesting the question of infringement raised in the present case.\n On the appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the record showed clearly that the Essex Company refused to become a party to the suit or assume any control over it, and took no part in the conduct or control of the suit, 'but only in the adjustment of the damages' after the pro confesso decree had been entered; and approved both the findings and ruling of the District Court.\n There is nothing which, under the well-settled rule, Del Pozo v. Wilson Cypress Co., \n269 \nU.S. 82, 89\n, 46 S. Ct. 57, justifies us in disturbing the concurrent findings of fact of the two courts below; and we concur in their ruling that on the facts thus found the Essex Company is not estopped from contesting the question of infringement.\n\n 2. \nThe question of infringement as here presented turns upon matters of law arising out of a file wrapper \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n defense interposed by the Essex Company, which insists that the reissued patent, although valid, was so limited in scope by the proceedings in the Patent Office that the Essex heels do not infringe.\n The patent covers the part of a shoe commonly called a rubber heel, or cushion heel lift. \n3\n This is usually made of rubber, and is attached to the under side of the leather heel so as to furnish a yielding, resilient heel, giving softness to the tread and quietness in walking. These heels, which are in common use, are of two types, the fiat and the concavo-convex, both of which were old when Tufford made his invention. The flat heel, which is the older, is cemented to the leather and then fastened on by nails or screws. The driving in of the nails or screws, however, has a tendency to cause the rubber to spring away from the leather around the edges and produce an open seam. In the concavo-convex type the body of the rubber heel is curved downwards. It is attached to the leather heel, without any cement, by placing its upper concave side under the leather, pressing it upward flatly and then nailing or screwing it on tightly. This, through the tendency of the rubber to resume its original curved form, tends to keep it tightly pressed upwards against the leather and overcome the tendency of the flat heels to separate from the leather at the edges. This characteristic of the concavo-convex heels, often called 'the tight- edge effect,' was referred to as early as 1889 in Ferguson's patent No. 638,228.\n The Tufford heel is of the concavo-convex type. We insert here reproductions of Figure 2 of the drawings of the reissued patent, which is described as 'a front to rear sectional view through the lift in position disposed against the under side of a shoe heel and immediately prior to application thereto,' and shows one-half of the lift on a \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n median section; and of Figure 4, which is described as 'a perspective view looking at the upper side of the lift removed.'\n\n The reissued patent contains ten claims. The first four, which repeat the claims of the original patent, relate merely to the form and position of the washers in a cushion heel lift, and to grooves, channels and suction areas in its concave surface. They are not here involved. The others are additional claims relating to shape defining improvements. The bill charges infringement of the new claims 5 to 9, inclusive. Claim 5 reads:\n'A heel lift of substantially non-metalic resilient material having its body portion of concavo-convex form on every line of cross section, the concave upper face lying entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and the breast4 corners of the lift.'\n\n The last clause in this claim, which we have italicized-about which the present controversy turns-is contained in all the other claims in suit in identical or precisely equivalent words, except that in claim 8 the word 'rear' does not appear before the words 'upper edge.' \n5\n For immediate purposes we treat claim 5 as typical of all the claims in suit, passing for the moment the consideration of the question whether there is any essential distinction in respect to claim 8. \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 436]\n\u00a0\n The Essex Company contends: (1) That by the proceedings in the Patent Office these claims were limited to the form of concavo-convex heel lift in which the concave upper face lies entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and breast corners, that is, one in which, owing to the curvature of the upper face, only its rear edge and breast corners lie in the same horizontal plane, and its side and breast edges, as well as all other portions of its surface, lie below the plane passing through and defined by these three points-this being referred to as the 'three-point contract' form, since when the lift is brought in contact with the leather heel, before being flattened, only the rear edge and two breast corners will touch the leather. (2) That the claims, thus limited, are not infringed by the Essex heels, as their upper side edges, having no vertical curve, lie in and not below the plane passing through the rear edge and breast corners.\n The file wrapper shows that on the application for the reissued patent it contained as first presented no reference to the position of the upper rear edge and breast edges of the lift in relation to the other portions of its upper surface. Several new claims were submitted some of which, at least,6 described a lift having its attaching face concave on every line of cross section. These were rejected by the examiner on reference to Nerger's patent No. 611,129. Another set of claims was then substituted describing a heel lift of resilient material comprising a body portion of concavo-convex form on every line of cross section and normally held in such form by its own inherent resiliency. These were also rejected by the examiner on reference to Nerger.\n After an interview with the examiner in which the applicant exhibited samples of his own lift and the Nerger lift, he them amended the specification by inserting the \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 437]\n\u00a0\n statement:\n'By reference to Figs. 2 and 4 of the drawings, it will be seen that the concave upper face of the lift lies entirely below a plane tangent to the rear upper edge and the breast corners of the lift, whereby to cause the entire margin of said lift to exert a uniform pressure on the heel of a shoe when the lift is positioned on the heel and the convex face thereof depressed to flatten said lift.'\n\n He also substituted another set of claims, 5 to 9, inclusive, Claim 5- which was typical of all the others unless claim 8 was differentiated by the fact that the word 'rear' did not appear before the words 'upper edge'- read:\n'A heel lift of substantially non-metalic resilient material having its body portion of concavo-convex form on every line of cross section, the concave upper face lying entirely below a plane tangent to the rear upper edge and the breast corners of the lift.'\n\n In presenting these amendments counsel for the applicant urged that Nerger's lift was not concavo-convex on every line of cross section since the deepest portion of the concavity in its upper surface was at the breast; and that its concave upper surface did not lie entirely below a plane tangent to the rear edge and breast corners. In replying, the examiner, after calling attention to the fact that on the application for the original patent the applicant had presented claims for a lift in which all the edges of the attaching face occupied the same plane-which were rejected-stated that Figure 2 of the drawings indicated the same construction and did not show a lift whose concave upper face lay entirely below a plane tangent to the rear upper edge and breast corners, as set forth in the amendment to the specification, since a point midway between the breast corners was in contact with the upper heel, and 'a plane tangent to the rear edge and the breast corners would also pass through the entire front (breast) edge'; that the applicant's sample lift did 'not correspond to the drawing, since all the points \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 438]\n\u00a0\n of its breast except the two corner points lie below a straight line passing through these points'; that in 'each of the claims 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 the applicant specifies that the concave upper face lies entirely below a plane tangent to the rear upper edge and the breast corners'; and that these claims do 'not read on the drawing, and are therefore rejected.'\n To meet this rejection the applicant further amended the specification by substituting for the prior amendment the statement:\n'By references to Figs. 2 and 4 of the drawings, it will be seen that the concave upper face of the lift lies entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and breast corners of the lift . ... In other words, owing to the curvature of the concave attaching face of the lift, the rear upper edge and breast corners of said concave attaching face are disposed in a plane above the upper side edges and the breast edges of the lift.'\n\n He also amended each of the claims by substituting the words 'passing through' for 'tangent to'-corresponding to the change that had been made in the specification-and added claim 10, reading:\n'A heel lift of substantially resilient material comprising a body portion, the attaching face of which is concave and the tread face convex on every line of cross section, the rear upper edge and breast corners of the concave attaching face of the lift being disposed in a plane above the upper side and breast edges of said concave attaching face.'\n\n In presenting these amendments counsel for the applicant stated that the matter quoted by the examiner from the file wrapper of the original patent merely showed, if anything, that error had crept into the prosecution of the original application, which should be corrected; that as Figure 4 of the drawings showed 'that the breast lift was cut away on a curved line, the attaching face of the lift at the breast thereof must necessarily lie in a plane below \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 439]\n\u00a0\n the breast corners and the rear edge of said lift or, in other words, the rear upper edge and breast corners of the concave attaching face are disposed in a plane above the upper side and breast edges thereof'; that the showing in Figure 2 was therefore obviously erroneous, and, although claim 10 read upon it without any correction, it did not clearly illustrate the applicant's invention; and that permission was requested to correct the drawing. This was granted, and Figure 2 was changed to the form which we have reproduced in this opinion, showing that the upper side and breast edges lie below a plane passing through the rear edge and breast corners. The new claims were then allowed, and the patent was reissued.\n It thus appears that the applicant acquiesced in the successive rejections by the examiner on reference to Nerger of claims for a lift having its attaching face concave on every line of cross section and for a lift of resilient material of a concavo-convex form on every line of cross section, and that to meet this reference he amended the specification so as to state not only that the concave upper surface lies entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and breast corners, but that 'in other words,' owing to the curvature of the concave attaching face, the rear upper edge and breast corners are disposed in a plane above the upper side and breast edges; amended the claims to describe a lift whose concave upper surface lies entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and breast corners; and finally changed his drawing so as to correspond precisely with these amendments-and that then, and not until then, were the claims allowed.\n We think that by this proceeding the claims were limited to the specific form of a 'threepoint contact' lift, that is, to one in which, owing to the vertical curve of the upper side and breast edges, these edges, \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 440]\n\u00a0\n as well as all other portions of the upper surface, lie below the plane passing through and defined by the rear upper edge and breast corners. We cannot agree with the opinion of the Cirucit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in United States Rubber Co. v. I. T. S. Rubber Co., 260 F. 947, 948, 171 C. C. A. 589, 590 that claim 10, which contains the limiting clause 'the rear upper edge and breast corners of the concave attaching face of the lift being disposed in a plane above the upper side and breast edges,' is the only one which is limited to the three-point contact lift. It is true that if the limiting clause in claims 5 to 9, 'the concave upper face lying entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and the breast corners,' stood alone, there might be some question as to whether the side and breast edges were to be considered as a part of the upper face. However, the meaning of this clause was made entirely clear by the last amendment to the specification, adding to the previous statement that the concave upper face lies entirely below a plane passing through the rear upper edge and breast corners, that, 'in other words,' the rear upper edge and breast corners are disposed in a plane above the upper side and breast edges. We are unable to agree with the view that the phrase 'in other words' was here used to connect alternative thoughts which were not identical, and think, that they were used in their ordinary sense to introduce a specific element of the identical matter previously described, precisely defining a lift whose upper surface lies below a plane passing through the rear edge and breast corners as one whose upper side and breast edges lie below this plane-this being emphasized by the statement made by counsel for the applicant and the corresponding change which was made in the drawing. The limiting clause in claims 5 to 9 must therefore be read in the sense in which it is thus defined by the specification, that is, as referring to a three-point contact lift whose side and breast edges, as well as all other points in its upper surface, lie below \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 441]\n\u00a0\n the plane passing through the rear edge and breast corners.\n There is no ground for differentiating claims 5 to 9 from claim 10 in this respect in order to give effect to claim 10. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit expressly declined to rest its conclusion on this ground. 260 F. at page 948, 171 C. C. A. 589. And as to this it suffices to say, that as was pointed out by the District Judge, claims 5 to 9 are sufficiently differentiated in other respects by the presence of subsidiary elements relating to the character of the material, nail openings, etc., that do not appear in claim 10.\n We find, further, no significance in the substitution of the words 'passing through' for 'tangent to' in the specification and claims. These phrases were used interchangeably by the examiner. The applicant pointed out no distinction in their meaning, and, so far as appears, merely adopted 'passing through' as the perferred form of equivalent expressions. And they have no difference in meaning as used in the specification and claims; the one phrase as well as the other aptly defining the plane passing through the upper rear edge and breast corners.\n We also find that the fact that the word 'rear' does not appear before the words 'upper edge' in claim 8 is not a ground upon which it may be differentiated from the others. It appears that this omission was inadvertent and unnoticed. The applicant called no attention to the omission and did not differentiate this claim from the others in his effort to avoid the reference to Nerger's patent. The examiner stated that 'each of the claims 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9' specified a plane tangent to 'the rear upper edge and the breast corners.' And we cannot believe that if the applicant's counsel intended to differentiate this claim from the others by the omission of the word 'rear,' he would have failed to disclose the distinction \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 442]\n\u00a0\n which he had in mind and permitted the examiner to pass upon the claim under a misapprehension as to its language. It was also stated by the District Judge that at the preliminary hearing on the motion to dismiss, the I. T. S. Gompany recognized that this clause in claim 8 read the same as in the other claims; that this had apparently been its position before other courts where these claims had been considered;7 and that it did not change its position in this respect until after the Circuit Court of Appeals on the hearing in that court on the motion to dismiss had called attention to the omission of the word 'rear.' We concur in the finding of the District Judge that the omission of the word 'rear' was through a clerical error due to oversight and that both the counsel for the applicant and the examiner understood that it was contained in claim 8 as well as the others; and we are of opinion that the claim should be construed and have the same effect as if it had been included. This is not in any real sense, a re-making of the claim; but is merely giving to it the meaning which was intended by the applicant and understood by the examiner.\n Furthermore, if by the omission of the word 'rear' this claim should otherwise be regarded as calling for a lift whose upper face lies entirely below a plane passing through the entire 'upper edge' and the breast corners, thereby making it a claim for a lift having all its upper edges in the same plane, such a construction would not only conflict with the express disclaimer of counsel for the applicant, but, as held by the Circuit Court of Appeals, render the claim invalid as being for a different invention from that described in the specification and drawings of the original patent. Mahn v. Harwood, 112 \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 443]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 354, 359, 5 S. Ct. 174, 6 S. Ct. 451; Parker & Whipple Co. v. Yale Lock Co., \n123 \nU.S. 87, 97\n, 8 S. Ct. 38. And, so construed, it would not read on the specification and drawings of the reissued patent.\n Having thus reached the conclusion that all of the claims in suit are limited to the three-point contact form of lift, it is unnecessary to determine here whether in calling for a lift of concavo-convex form on every line of cross-section, any of them are also limited to a 'saucer- shaped,' as distinguished from a 'scoop-shaped,' lift; that is, to one having in its upper surface a low spot centrally disposed which is below the lowest point in the breast edge, as has been held by the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n It is well settled that where an applicant for a patent to cover a new combination is compelled by the rejection of his application by the Patent Office to narrow his claim by the introduction of a new element, he cannot after the issue of the patent broaden his claim by dropping the element which he was compelled to include in order to secure his patent. Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 593, 597\n, 6 S. Ct. 493. If dissatisfied with the rejection he should pursue his remedy by appeal; and where, in order to get his patent, he accepts one with a narrower claim, he is bound by it. Shepard v. Carrigan, supra; Hubbell v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 77, 83\n, 21 S. Ct. 24. Whether the examiner was right or wrong in rejecting the original claim, the court is not to inquire. Hubbell v. United States, supra. The applicant having limited his claim by amendment and accepted a patent, brings himself within the rules \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 444]\n\u00a0\n that if the claim to a combination be restricted to specified elements, all must be regarded as material, and that limitations imposed by the inventor, especially such as were introduced into an application after it had been persistently rejected, must be strictly construed against the inventor and looked upon as disclaimers. Sargent v. Hall Safe & Lock Co., \n114 \nU.S. 63, 86\n, 5 S. Ct. 1021; Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 598\n, 6 S. Ct. 493, supra; Hubbell v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 85\n, 21 S. Ct. 24, supra. The patentee is thereafter estopped to claim the benefit of his rejected claim or such a construction of his amended claim as would be equivalent thereto. Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Paper Co., \n152 \nU.S. 425, 429\n, 14 S. Ct. 627. So where an applicant whose claim is rejected on reference to a prior patent, without objection or appeal, voluntarily restricts himself by an amendment of his claim to a specific structure, having thus narrowed his claim in order to obtain a patent, he 'may not by construction, or by resort to the doctrine of equivalents, give to the claim the larger scope which it might have had without the amendments, which amount to a disclaimer.' Weber Elec. Co. v. Freeman Elec. Co., \n256 \nU.S. 668, 677\n, 41 S. Ct. 600, 603 (65 L. Ed. 1162).\n It results that as the claims in suit were limited by the proceedings in the Patent Office to the specific form of a three-point contact lift, they are not infringed by the heels made by the Essex Company, which are not three-point contact lifts, their upper side edges having no vertical curve and lying entirely in the same horizontal plane as the rear edge and breast corners. Nor can they be held to be infringements even if we assume that, as asserted, they function in the same manner as three-point contact lifts, and would infringe, as was conceded in the District Court, if the claims were not restricted by the limiting clause and were entitled to a construction warranting a wide range of equivalents. By the limitation of the claims in the Patent Office proceeding to the three-point contact lift the patentee made this precise form a \n\n[272 U.S. 429, 445]\n\u00a0\n material element, and having thus narrowed the claims, cannot, as was said in the Weber Electric Company Case, now enlarge their scope by a resort to the doctrine of equivalents. This would render nugatory the specific limitation.\n The decree is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Various intermediate proceedings, on a preliminary motion to dismiss, appear in 270 F. 593 (D.

North T. Genty, of Jefferson City, Mo., and Oliver Senti, James T. Blair, and Charles P. Williams, all of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion by Buder and other taxing officers of the city of St. Louis for leave to file in this court a petition for a writ of mandamus against the federal District Judge of the Eastern Division of the Eastern Judicial District of Missouri, or, in the alternative, for a writ of certiorari to that court, and for a rule to show cause why such writs should not issue. The purpose of the petition is to compel the District Judge to allow a direct appeal to this court from a final decree entered by that court on December 7, 1925, against the taxing officers in a suit \n\n[271 U.S. 461, 463]\n\u00a0\n brought by the First National Bank in St. Louis for a permanent injunction restraining the enforcement of a tax levied upon its stockholders. First National Bank v. Buder, 8 F.(2d) 883.\n The decree was entered upon a hearing before a single judge. An interlocutory injunction had not been prayed for in the bill, or otherwise sought. The taxing officers, took an appeal to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which was allowed and is now pending. Then they applied to the District Judge for the allowance also of a direct appeal to the court, because they were uncertain whether the appeal lay to it or to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Judge refused the application, and stated as his reasons that the appeal had been properly taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, had been allowed, and was pending there, and that this court did not have jurisdiction of the case on appeal. An application for allowance of the appeal was then presented to the Justice of this court assigned to that circuit and was denied. Thereupon, within three months after entry of the decree in the District Court, this motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus was made.\n That this court has power to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a lower federal court to allow an appeal to this court has long been settled. Ex parte Crane, 5 Pet. 190; United States v. Gomez, 3 Wall. 752, 766. In a few instances the writ of mandamus has issued for that purpose. Vigo's Case, 21 Wall. 648; Ex parte Jordan, \n94 U.S. 248\n; Ex parte Railroad Co., \n95 U.S. 221\n. In other cases, where there was reason to believe that an appeal was wrongly denied by the lower court, and no other remedy appeared to be available, this court granted the motion for leave to file the petition and issue a rule to show cause. Mussina v. Cavazos, 20 How. 281; Ex parte Cutting, \n94 U.S. 14\n. Where it was clear that the petitioner \n\n[271 U.S. 461, 464]\n\u00a0\n had another remedy, the motion for leave to file the petition was denied. Ex parte Virginia Commissioners, \n112 \nU.S. 177\n, 5 S. Ct. 421. The motion should likewise be denied where it is clear that the appeal does not lie, or for other reasons the relief sought by the petition cannot be granted. Ex parte Brown, \n271 \nU.S. 645\n, 46 S. Ct. 489, 70 L. Ed. -, decided May 10, 1926. Compare In re Green, \n141 \nU.S. 325\n, 12 S. Ct. 11; Iowa v. Slimmer, \n248 \nU.S. 115\n, 39 S. Ct. 33. In the case at bar we deem it clear that there was no right to a direct appeal to this court. We therefore deny the motion for leave to file the petition.\n In support of the claim to a direct appeal, it is contended that the injunction complained of was granted on the ground that the state taxing statute violates the federal Constitution. The assignment of errors, which accompanied the petition for allowance of the appeal, alleged that the District Court erred, also, in not holding unconstitutional a recent federal statute involved. These contentions, if substantial, would have supplied the basis for a direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), before that section was amended by Act Feb. 13, 1925, c 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1215). But section 238 was so far changed by that act that now there is no right to such a direct appeal on constitutional grounds, unless the case arises under section 266 of the Judicial Code as amended by that act (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1243). Otherwise it must go in the first instance to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and may come here only for the review of that court's action.\n The suits to which section 266 relates are those in which the relief sought is an 'interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a state by restraining the action of any officer of such state in the enforcement or execution of such statute, or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such state ... upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.' In any such suit the application \n\n[271 U.S. 461, 465]\n\u00a0\n for an interlocutory injunction was required to be heard before three judges, and from their decree a direct appeal lay to this court; but, prior to the Act of February 13, 1925, a final hearing in the suit was had before a single judge. Compare Patterson v. Mobile Gas Co., \n271 \nU.S. 131\n, 46 S. Ct. 445, No. 225, decided April 26, 1926. From his decree a direct appeal to this court could be founded only upon the provisions of section 238 as originally enacted. Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 40 S. Ct. 221. Where the jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked upon other federal grounds, as well as the one attacking the constitutionality of the state statute, an appeal might be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, with ultimate review in this court if the case was of the class within its jurisdiction. Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50, 53\n, 42 S. Ct. 244. To remove the existing anomaly, and to prevent that which would otherwise have resulted from the repealing provisions of the Act of February 13, 1925, that act further amended section 266, as amended by Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013, being Comp. St.  1243, by adding at the end thereof:\n'The requirement respecting the presence of three judges shall also apply to the final hearing in such suit in the District Court; and a direct appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction in such suit.' Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1243\n\n\n\n As so amended, section 266 also permits a direct appeal to this court from the final decree in those suits in which the hearing on an application for an interlocutory injunction is required to be before three judges.\n First National Bank v. Buder, supra, is not a case of that character, because no state statute is assailed as being repugnant to the federal Constitution. The tax upon the shares in the bank was assessed as of June 1, 1923, for the year 1924. It was assessed pursuant to a statute in force ever since 1889, which had been incorporated as section 12775 in the Revised Statutes of Missouri of 1919. Prior to the Act of Congress of March 4, 1923, c. 267, 42 Stat. 1499 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  9784), \n\n[271 U.S. 461, 466]\n\u00a0\n amending section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  9784), that statute was confessedly valid and operative. \n1\n It was then the only method of taxation permitted by the federal law. The act of 1923 enlarged the scope of the state's power to tax national banks. It authorized the state either to tax the shares of a national bank, or to include dividends derived therefrom in taxable income of the holder thereof, or to tax the income of the bank, and provided that the 'imposition by said state of any one of the above three forms of taxation shall be in lieu of the others.' In 1917 Missouri enacted a law (Laws 1917, p. 524) taxing income which, so far as here material, has remained in force without change. After the 1923 act of Congress, the state might, in the exercise of the option which that act conferred, have elected to tax national banks by taxing the income, instead of by taxing the shares as had theretofore been done. The state did not by any new legislation signify its election among the three permissible modes of taxation. Because it had not done so, the District Court held the assessment void and enjoined the taxing officials. Whether it erred in so holding is the question for decision on the appeal.\n The claim that the tax is void rests, not upon a contention that the state statute under which it was laid is unconstitutional, but upon a contention that the statute is no longer in force. The state confessedly has the same power to tax the shares that it had before Congress enacted the 1923 amendment. The argument is that, as the state after 1923 had the option to tax either the shares or the income, it must manifest its election and has not done so. Whether, in order to do so, it must enact new legislation depends upon the construction of the act of Congress. Whether, if this is not necessary, it has manifested its election by the existing legislation, depends upon \n\n[271 U.S. 461, 467]\n\u00a0\n the construction of the state statutes. But in neither of these questions is the constitutionality of the state statutes involved, and a substantial claim of unconstitutionality is necessary for the application of section 266. See Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 304\n, 34 S. Ct. 48.

Davis, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for rehearing of a case in which the opinion was handed down January 11th last. The case \n\n[270 U.S. 84, 85]\n\u00a0\n was a bill in equity in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, filed by the Radio Corporation to enjoin the Independent Wireless Company from infringing the rights of the Radio Company, which were averred in its bill to be those of an exclusive sublicensee of the patentee, the De Forest Radio Telegraph & Telephone Company, in respect of the use of certain radio apparatus for commercial communication between ships and shore for pay. The Radio Company made the De Forest Company a co- complainant in the bill, reciting that it had asked the De Forest Company to become a co-complainant, and that it had refused; that the De Forest Company was a resident of Delaware, was beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, and could not be served with process; and that under such circumstances it had the right to use the name of the De Forest Company as co-complainant without its consent. A motion to dismiss the bill was granted by the District Court for lack of the presence of the patentee as a party, and an appeal was taken from the decree of dismissal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The latter court reversed the decree of dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. Thereupon an application was made to this court for certiorari, and the certiorari was issued. In the opinion already rendered, January 11th last, this court held that the Radio Corporation properly made the De Forest Company a co-complainant with it in the bill without its consent, and therefore that the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing the decree of the District Court dismissing the bill was right.\n The petition for rehearing on behalf of the Independent Wireless Company now filed, raises the question whether the Radio Corporation is an exclusive sublicensee of the patentee, the De Forest Company, under the contracts from which the Radio Company derives its rights, and which are exhibits to the bill. It is the first time that this question has been made in this court. The bill which was dis- \n\n[270 U.S. 84, 86]\n\u00a0\n missed makes the specific averment that the Radio Corporation did have the rights of an exclusive licensee. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found from the contracts as exhibited that the Radio Company had the exclusive rights as sublicensee which it claimed. The briefs for the Independent Wireless Company did not raise any question on this point in this court, nor was it mentioned in that company's petition for certiorari. Its whole argument therein was devoted to the issue whether, assuming that the Radio Company was an exclusive licensee, it could make the patentee company, the De Forest Company a co-complainant. As the District Judge remarked in his opinion, the contracts out of which the Radio Company's alleged exclusive license arises are complicated, and this court, in view of the decision of both the lower courts, holding such exclusive rights in the Radio Company as a licensee to exist, decided the case on the basis of those rights. In view of the course of the Independent Wireless Company in not making this point in its petition for certiorari, briefs or argument, we do not propose to examine this question now raised for the first time. Our writ of certiorari was granted solely because of the importance the question of patent practice decided in our opinion already announced. However, as the case must now be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, we have no wish by action of ours to preclude the defendant below from making the point unless it is prevented by his course in the courts below.\n We therefore direct the mandate to include a provision that the further proceedings to be taken shall be without prejudice, by reason of anything in the opinion or decree of this court, to the right of the Independent Wireless Company to raise the issue, by answer or otherwise whether the Radio Corporation has the rights as an exclusive sublicensee, which it avers in its bill. With this reservation, the petition for rehearing is denied. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINDEPENDENT WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO. v. RADIO CORPORATION OF(1926)\nNo. 87\nArgued: October 23, 1925Decided: January 11, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. H. Davis, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Radio Corporation, a corporation of Delaware, filed a bill in equity in the Southern district of New York, joining with itself the De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company, also of Delaware, as coplaintiff, against the Independent Wireless Telegraph Company of Delaware and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company of New York. The case made in the bill was this: \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n Lee De Forest invented and received patents Nos. 841,387 and 879,532, dated in 1908 and 1909, for devices for amplifying feeble electric currents and certain new and useful improvements in space telegraphy. After giving limited licenses of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, he assigned the patents to the De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company. On March 16, 1917, the De Forest Company, by writing duly recorded, gave an exclusive license to make, use, and sell the devices for the life of the patents to the Western Electric Company, reserving to itself nonexclusive, nontransferable, and personal rights to make, use, and sell them for defined purposes. The Western Electric Company then assigned all that it thus received from the De Forest Company to the American Telephone Company. The American Telephone Company, on July 1, 1920, made a contract with the General Electric Company, by which they exchanged rights in various patents owned or controlled by each, including these rights in the De Forest patents. Some seven months prior, on November 20, 1919, the General Electric Company had granted to the Radio Corporation, the plaintiff, an exclusive license to use and sell for 'radio purposes'-i. e., 'for transmission or reception of communication by what are known as electric magnetic waves except by wire'-all inventions owned by the General Electric Company or thereafter acquired by it. The American Telephone Company subsequently confirmed in the Radio Corporation these after-acquired rights in the De Forest patents. Thus there came from the De Forest Company to the Radio Corporation exclusive rights to use and sell in the United States, for radio purposes, apparatus for transmission of messages, and especially for use between ship and shore for pay.\n The defendant, the Independent Wireless Company, has bought the same apparatus, with the lawful right to use it in the amateur and experimental field only. The \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n apparatus thus bought bears a label with such a limitation on its use. The charge in the bill is that the Independent Company is using the apparatus, or the part of it called 'radio tubes,' in the commercial radio field between ship and shore for pay, and thus is violating the Radio Corporation's rights in this field. An injunction is prayed, and an accounting of profits and all damages to the plaintiffs and the American Telephone Company, as their interests shall appear.\n The twenty-fifth averment of the bill is:\n'That 'the plaintiff, the De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company, as hereinbefore alleged, has certain rights in the patents in suit herein; that before filing this bill of complaint, said De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company, was requested to consent to join, as a coplaintiff, herein, but declined; that said De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company is not within the jurisdiction of the court and therefore cannot be made a defendant herein; and that therefore to prevent a failure of justice, and to enable the plaintiff Radio Corporation of America to protect its exclusive rights under the patents in suit, said De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company is made a plaintiff herein without its consent.'\n\n After securing an order for a bill of particulars, compliance with which disclosed the various agreements referred to in the bill and and facts relevant thereto, the Independent Wireless Telegraph Company, defendant, moved that the court dismiss the bill of complaint, upon the following ground:\n'That the De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company, the owner of the patent in suit, has not joined in this litigation as a party plaintiff by duly signing and verifying the bill of complaint herein, and the plaintiff Radio Corporation of America is not such a licensee under the patents as to permit it to sue alone in its own name, in the name of the owner of the patents in suit, or to \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n sue in the name of the owner of the patents, joining itself as a licensee under the patents.'\n\n The District Court sustained the motion and dismissed the bill, in the view that it was bound by decisions of this court to hold that the De Forest Company was the owner of the patent and an indispensable party, and, being out of the jurisdiction, could not be made a party defendant by service or joined as a party plaintiff against its will. 297 F. 518. The Circuit Court of Appeals, on appeal, reversed the District Court, held that the De Forest Company was properly made coplaintiff by the Radio Corporation, and remanded the case for further proceedings. 297 F. 521. We have brought the case here on certiorari. Section 240, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217).\n The respondent, in its argument to sustain the ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals, presses two points. The first is that by the contract between the De Forest Company and the Western Electric Company title to the patent was vested in the Western Electric Company, and from it by assignment in the American Telephone & Telegraph Company; that the latter is a party defendant, having declined to be a plaintiff, and so satisfies the requirement of the presence in such a suit as a party of the owner of the patent. The difficulty the respondent meets in this suggestion is that its bill avers that what the American Telephone Company acquired from the De Forest Company was a license, so called in the contract creating it, and the making of the De Forest Company a party plaintiff to the bill was necessarily on the theory that it, and not the American Telephone Company, is the owner of the patent. The contracts between the corporations involved in the transfer of rigths under the patent are long and complicated, and in order to be fully understood require some knowledge of the new radio field. The court is loath to depart, if it could, from the theory on which the bill was framed and both courts have acted, unless required to do so. \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n The question for our consideration then is: Can the Radio Company make the De Forest Company a coplaintiff against its will under the circumstances of the case?\n Section 4919, R. S. (Comp. St.  9464), is as follows:\n'Damages for the infringement of any patent may be recovered by action on the case, in the name of the party interested, either as pattentee, assignee, or grantee. And whenever in any such action a verdict is rendered for the plaintiff, the court may enter judgment thereon for any sum above the amount found by the verdict as the actual damages sustained, according to the circumstances of the case, not exceeding three times the amount of such verdict, together with the costs.'\n\n In Goodyear v. Bishop, 10 Fed. Cas. 642, No. 5,558, a suit for damages for infringement had been brought in the name of the patentee by a licensee under the fourteenth section of the Patent Act of 1836 (5 Stat. 357, c. 357), which contained language similar to section 4919. The defendant moved with the consent of the patentee to discontinue the suit. It was contended that, as the patentee had stipulated with the licensee to sue infringers, his remedy was on the covenant. Mr. Justice Nelson, at the circuit, denied the motion. He said that a suit at law to protect the patent right was properly brought in the name of the patentee, that the license was sufficient to give the protection sought, and that the covenant by the patentee did not take from the licensee the remedy by use of the patentee's name to proceed directly against the wrongdoer. The same ruling was made in Goodyear v. McBurney, 10 Fed. Cas. 699, No. 5,574.\n These cases were decided in 1860 by a justice of this court, and no case is cited to us questioning their authority. Indeed, the cases have been since referred to a number of times with approval by distinguished patent judges. \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Blatchford, while Circuit Judge, in Nelson v. McMann, 17 Fed. Cas. 1325, 1329, No. 10,109; Mr. Justice Gray, while Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in Jackson v. Allen, 120 Mass. 64, 77; Judge Lowell, in Wilson v. Chickering (C. C.) 14 F. 917, 918; Judge Shipman, in Brush-Swan Co. v. Thomson Co. (C. C.) 48 F. 224, 226. The term 'action on the case' and the phrase 'in the name of the party interested, either as patentee, assignee, or grantee' in section 4919 were evidently construed to constitute a remedy at law like the suit at common law on a chose in action in the name of the assignor in which the assignment gave the assignee the right as attorney of the assignor to use the latter's name. Lectures on Legal History, Ames, 213. See, also, Eastman v. Wright, 6 Pick. 316; Pickford v. Ewington, 4 Dowling, P. C. 458; McKinney v. Alvis, 14 Ill. 33.\n But section 4919 applied by its terms only to actions on the case at law to which the licensee was not a necessary and hardly a proper party. This is a bill in equity. The remedy for violation of an exclusive licensee's interest in equity under the patent laws is found in section 4921, R. S., which is as follows:\n'The several courts vested with jurisdiction of cases arising under the patent laws shall have power to grant injunctions according to the course and principles of courts of equity, to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent, on such terms as the court may deem reasonable; and upon a decree being rendered in any such case for an infringement, the complainant shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the profits to be accounted for by the defendant, the damages the complainant has sustained thereby; and the court shall assess the same or cause the same to be assessed under its direction. And the court shall have the same power to increase such damages, in its discretion, as is given to increase the damages \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n found by verdicts in actions in the nature of actions of trespass upon the case.'1\n\n There is no express authority given to the licensee to use the name of the patent owner in equity as we have seen that he can under section 4919 in suits at law. The presence of the patentee or his assignee in the equity suit, however, it has been held, is just as essential to obtaining an injunction, or an accounting of profits or damages, under the patent laws, as it is in an action on the case for damages at law. Indeed both the owner and the exclusive licensee are generally necessary parties in the action in equity. Waterman v. Mackenzie, \n138 \nU.S. 252\n, 11 S. Ct. 334; Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205, 223; Paper Bay Cases, \n105 U.S. 766\n; Birdsell v. Shaliol, \n112 \nU.S. 485, 486\n, 5 S. Ct. 244.\n It is urged on behalf of the respondent that in equity the real party in interest, the exclusive licensee whose contract rights are being trespassed upon by the infringer, should be able without the presence of the owner of the patent to obtain an injunction and damages directly against the infringer. We recognize that there is a tendency in courts of equity to enjoin the violation of contract rights which are invaded by strangers in a direct action by the party injured, instead of compelling a roundabout resort to a remedy through the covenant, express or implied, of the other contracting party. But such a short cut, however desirable, is not possible in a case like this. A suit without the owner of the patent as a plaintiff, if maintainable, would not be a suit under section 4921 of the patent laws, but only an action in equity, based on the contract rights of the licensee under the license and a \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 467]\n\u00a0\n stranger's violation of them. There would be no jurisdiction in courts of the United States to entertain it, unless by reason of diverse citizenship of the parties, which does not exist in this case. Hill v. Whitcomb, 12 Fed. Cas. 182, 185, No. 6,502; Wilson v. Sandford, 10 How, 99, 101; Albright v. Teas, \n106 \nU.S. 613\n, 1 S. Ct. 550, and cases cited.\n What remedies, then, can equity afford in a case like this? Waterman v. Mackenzie, \n138 \nU.S. 252\n, 11 S. Ct. 334, involved the question whether a grant from the owner of the patent of the exclusive right to make and sell, but not to use, was an assignment under the statute, entitling the grantee in his own name to sue an infringer in equity, and it was held that it was not. Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, at page 255 (11 S. Ct. 335), said:\n'In equity, as at law, when the transfer amounts to a license only, the title remains in the owner of the patent; and suit must be brought in his name, and never in the name of the licensee alone, unless that is ncessary to prevent an absolute failure of justice, as where the patentee is the infringer, and cannot sue himself. Any rights of the licensee must be enforced through or in the name of the owner of the patent, and perhaps, if necessary to protect the rights of all parties, joining the licensee with him as a plaintiff. Rev. Stat.  4921; Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205, 223 (22 L. Ed. 577); Paper Bag Cases, \n105 U.S. 766\n, 771 (26 L. Ed. 959); Birdsell v. Shaliol, \n112 U.S. 485\n-487 (5 S. Ct. 244). And see Renard v. Levinstein, 2 Hem. & Mil. 628.'\n\n Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205, was a suit for infringement by one to whom was granted an exclusive right to make, use, and vend by the patent owner. The court held that it was an assignment under the statute, but further held that even if it were only an exclusive license, the suit might be maintained under the patent laws, because the patentee who had been privy to the alleged \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 468]\n\u00a0\n infringement had been made a party defendant with the infringer. This court said at page 223:\n'A mere licensee cannot sue strangers who infringe. In such case redress is obtained through or in the name of the patentee or his assignee. Here, however, the patentee is the infringer, and, as he cannot sue himself, the licensee is powerless, so far as the courts of the United States are concerned, unless he can sue in his own name. A court of equity looks to substance rather than form. When it has jurisdiction of parties, it grants the appropriate relief, without regard to whether they come as plaintiff or defendant. In this case the person who should have protected the plaintiff against all infringements has become himself the infringer. He held the legal title to his patent in trust for his licensees. He has been faithless to his trust, and courts of equity are always open for the redress of such a wrong. This wrong is an infringement. Its redress involves a suit, therefore, arising under the patent laws, and of that suit the Circuit Court has jurisdiction.'\n\n The presence of the owner of the patent as a party is indispensable, not only to give jurisdiction under the patent laws, but also in most cases to enable the alleged infringer to respond in one action to all claims of infringement for his act, and thus either to defeat all claims in the one action, or by satisfying one adverse decree to bar all subsequent actions.\n If the owner of a patent, being within the jurisdiction, refuses or is unable to join an exclusive licensee as coplaintiff, the licensee may make him a party defendant by process, and he will be lined up by the court in the party character which he should assume. This is the necessary effect of the decision in littlefield v. Perry, supra. See, also, Brammer v. Jones, 4 Fed. Cas. 11, No. 1,806; Gamewell Telegraph Co. v. Brooklyn (C. C.) 14 F. 255; Waterman v. Shipman, 55 F. 982, 986, 5 C. C. A. 371; Libbey Glass Co. v. McKee Glass Co. (D. C.) 216 \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 469]\n\u00a0\n F. 172, affirmed Id. (C. C. A.) 220 F. 672; Hurd v. Goold, 203 F. 998, 122 C. C. A. 298. This would seem to be in accord with general equity practice. Waldo v. Waldo, 52 Mich. 91, 17 N. W. 709; Id., 52 Mich. 94, 17 N. W. 710. A cestui que trust may make an unwilling trustee a defendant in a suit to protect the subject of the trust. Porter v. Sabin, \n149 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 13 S. Ct. 1008; Brun v. Mann, 151 F. 145, 153, 80 C. C. A. 513, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 154; Monmouth Co. v. Means, 151 F. 159, 165, 80 C. C. A. 527; Eastman v. Wright, 6 Pick. 312, 316.\n It seems clear, then, on principle and authority, that the owner of a patent, who grants to another the exclusive right to make, use, or vend the invention, which does not constitute a statutory assignment, holds the title to the patent in trust for such a licensee, to the extent that he must allow the use of his name as plaintiff in any action brought at the instance of the licensee in law or in equity to obtain damages for the injury to his exclusive right by an infringer, or to enjoin infringement of it. Such exclusive licenses frequently contain express covenants by the patent owner and licensor to sue infringers, that expressly cast upon the former the affirmative duty of initiating and bearing the expense of the litigation. But, without such express covenants, the implied obligation of the licensor to allow the use of his name is indispensable to the enjoyment by the licensee of the monopoly which by personal contract the licensor has given. Inconvenience and possibly embarrassing adjudication in respect to the validity of the licensor's patent rights, as the result of suits begun in aid of the licensee, are only the equitable and inevitable sequence of the licensor's contract, whether express or implied.\n But suppose the patentee and licensor is hostile, and is out of the jurisdiction where suit for infringement must be brought, what remedy is open to the exclusive licensee? The matter has been given attention by courts dealing with patent cases. In Wilson v. Chickering, supra, at page 918, an exclusive licensee brought a bill in equity to \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 470]\n\u00a0\n enjoin infringement without joining the owner of the patent. A demurrer was sustained, with 30 days to amend. Judge Lowell, after saying that a mere licensee cannot generally, in equity, sue in equity without joining the patentee, said:\n'I do not, however, intend to be understood that the plaintiff will be without remedy if he cannot find the patentee, or if the latter is hostile. The statute does not abridge the power of a court of equity to do justice to the parties before it, if others who cannot be found are not absolutely necessary parties, as in this case the patentee is not. At law the plaintiff could use the name of a patentee in an action, and perhaps he may have the right in equity under some circumstances. The bill gives no explanation of his absence; but it was said in argument that he is both out of the jurisdiction and hostile. If so, no doubt there are methods known to a court of equity by which the suit may proceed for the benefit of the only person who is entitled to damages.'\n\n In Renard v. Levinstein, 2 Hem. & Mil. 628, before Vice Chancellor Page Wood, afterwards Lord Hatherly, an exclusive licensee brought suit to enjoin infringement by a stranger, and made the patentees who were a foreign firm coplaintiffs. There was no objection to this action. No specific authority for this appeared, but it seems to have been implied from the relation of the exclusive licensee and the owner of the patent. It has some significance here in the fact that it was apparently referred to by Mr. Justice Gray, in Waterman v. Mackenzie, supra, as indicating what could be done in an English court of equity to enable the licensee to secure protection in the name of the owner of the patent.\n In the case of Brush-Swan Electric Co. v. Thomson-Houston (C. C.) 48 F. 224, the Brush-Swan Company in Connecticut sued the Thomson-Houston Company in equity for infringing the former's rights as an exclusive \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 471]\n\u00a0\n licensee for the sale of a device made under a patent owned by the Brush Electric Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The Brush-Swan Company made the Brush Electric Company a coplaintiff. The Cleveland company appeared for the purpose of asking that its name be stricken out as a party complainant, because the bill had been filed without its consent. The motion to strike out the coplaintiff's name was denied by Judge Shipman, on the ground that as the patent owner, being without the jurisdiction, could not be served with process, there would otherwise be absolute failure of justice. The judge said that prima facie there was an implied power in the exclusive licensee under such circumstances to make the patent owner a party plaintiff. The same conclusion was approved by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Brush Electric Co. v. California Electric Co., 52 F. 945, 3 C. C. A. 368, before McKenna and Gilbert, Circuit Judges, and Knowles, the District Judge, affirming the same case in 49 F. 73, and by the same court in Excelsior Co. v. Allen, 104 F. 553, 44 C. C. A. 30, and in Excelsior Co. v. The City of Seattle, 117 F. 140, 143, 144, 55 C. C. A. 156. In Hurd v. Goold Co., 203 F. 998, 122 C. C. A. 298, before the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit (Lacombe, Coxe, and Noyes, Judges), Hurd, who was the exclusive licensee, joined with himself two corporations who held the legal title to the patent. The corporations had been enjoined in the Sixth circuit from maintaining suits for infringement. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that Hurd was entitled to present his licensors, that is, the owners of the pattent-as coplaintiffs, even against their will and in spite of their protects. This doctrine was approved by the same court in Radio Corporation v. Emerson, 296 F. 51, 54. See, also, McKee Glass Co. v. Libbey Glass Co., 220 F. 672, 136 C. C. A. 314 (3d C. C. A.), affirming same (D. C.) 216 F. 172; Chisholm v. Johnson, 106 F. 191, 212; Owatonna Mfg. Co. v. Fargo (C. C.) 94 F. 519, 520. \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 472]\n\u00a0\n It is objected to the relevancy of these authorities that not one of them actually presents the case here. In all of them it is said the owner or patentee was within the jurisdiction of the court and could be served, or else had come into the jurisdiction voluntarily to move for leave to withdraw as a party. As the court had the owner before it, and the owner was in duty bound to become a party, the court could prevent the withdrawal. Here the owner is not in the jurisdiction and does not come in. It is the defendant, the alleged infringer, which objects to using the name of the owner as plaintiff without its consent.\n We think the cases cited go beyond the defendant's interpretation of them, and do hold that, if there is no other way of securing justice to the exclusive licensee, the latter may make the owner without the jurisdiction a coplaintiff without his consent in the bill against the infringer. Equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy. 1 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed.)  423, 424. While this maxim is, of course, not of universal application, it justifies the short step needed to hold that in an equity suit under section 4921, where otherwise justice to the exclusive licensee would fail, he may make the owner of the patent a coplaintiff in his bill under section 4921, in analogy to the remedy given him in an action on the case at law for damages under section 4919, for the two sections are plainly in pari materia.\n In so doing, equity does no more than courts of law did, at one period in their history, as we have seen, in implying in the assignee of a chose in action a power of attorney to maintain an action in the name of the assignor in order to assure to the assignee the benefits of his assignment. Where the assignor attempted to interfere with the exercise of the power of attorney by collection of the assignee's claim, or where for any technical reason the remedy through the exercise of implied power of attorney \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 473]\n\u00a0\n was unavailable, equity intervened to lend its aid to the assignee and secure a recovery for his benefit. See Lenox v. Roberts, 2 Wheat. 373; Hammond v. Messenger, 9 Sim. 327; Roberts v. Lloyd, 1 De G. & J. 208; Hodge v. Cole, 140 Mass. 116, 2 N. E. 774; Hughes v. Nelson, 29 N. J. Eq. 547; Hayes v. Hayes, 45 N. J. Eq. 461, 17 A. 634.\n The objection by the defendant that the name of the owner of the patent is used as a plaintiff in this suit without authority is met by the obligation the owner is under to allow the use of his name and title to pro tect all lawful exclusive licensees and sublicensees against infringers, and by the application of the maxim that equity regards that as done which ought to be done. Camp v. Boyd, \n229 \nU.S. 530, 559\n, 33 S. Ct. 785; United States v. Colorado Anthracite Co., \n225 \nU.S. 219, 223\n, 32 S. Ct. 617; Craig v. Leslie, 3 Wheat. 563, 578. The court should on these grounds refuse to strike out the name of the owner as coplaintiff, put in the bill under proper averment by the exclusive licensee.\n The owner beyond the reach of process may be made coplaintiff by the licensee, but not until after he has been requested to become such voluntarily. If he declines to take any part in the case, though he knows of its imminent pendency and of his obligation to join, he will be bound by the decree which follows. We think this result follows from the general principles of res judicata. In american Bell Telephone Co. v. National Telephone Co. (C. C.) 27 F. 663, heard before Judges Pardee and Billings, the question was whether the National Telephone Company was bound by a decree in favor of the Bell Company for infringement against a Pittsburgh company claiming under a license from the National Company. The National Company, under a contract upon notice to defend its license, took control of the case, but, becoming dissatisfied with a preliminary ruling of the court, withdrew its counsel and evidence from the case. The National Company was held bound on the authority \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 474]\n\u00a0\n of the case of Robbins v. Chicago, 4 Wall. 657. When Robbins was building a store in Chicago by an independent contractor, an areaway adjoining the street was left open. A passer-by fell in and was injured. He sued the city, and recovered judgment for $15,000. Robbins had been previously warned by the city of the danger of the unprotected area, and had notice of the accident and of the pendency of the suit, but did not become a party. The city then sued Robbins, and was given a judgment against him for the amount of the recovery against the city. This court, in sustaining the result, held that parties bound by the judgment in such a case included all who were directly interested in the subject-matter, who had knowledge of the pendency of the suit and a right to take part therein, even if they refused or neglected to appear and avail themselves of this right. Lovejoy v. Murray, 3 Wall. 1, 19; Plumb v. Goodnow, \n123 \nU.S. 560\n, 8 S. Ct. 216; Robertson v. Hill, 20 Fed. Cas. 944, No. 11,925; Miller v. Liggett (C. C.) 7 F. 91.\n By a request to the patent owner to join as coplaintiff, by notice of the suit after refusal and the making of the owner a coplaintiff, he is given a full opportunity, by taking part in the cause, to protect himself against any abuse of the use of his name as plaintiff, while, on the other hand, the defendant, charged with infringement, will secure a decree saving him from multiciplicity of suits for infringement. Of course, a decree in such a case would constitute an estoppel of record against the patent owner, if challenged, only after evidence of the exclusive license, the request to join as coplaintiff, and the notice of the suit.\n There is nothing in the case of Crown Co. v. Nye Tool Works, \n261 \nU.S. 24\n, 43 S. Ct. 254, which conflicts with this conclusion. That case was brought by the plaintiff, a licensee, to establish as a principle of patent practice that a transfer by an owner of a patent to another, conferring only the right to sue a third for past and future infringe- \n\n[269 U.S. 459, 475]\n\u00a0\n ments of the patent, without the right to make, use, and vend the patented article was an assignment of the patent under section 4898, R. S. (Comp. St.  9444). We declined so to hold. There was no offer to make the owner of the patent a party, nor were there any facts showing that the owner would not join as coplaintiff or was not in the jurisdiction. The appellant stood solely upon his right to sue as an assignee of the patent and was defeated.\n We hold that the De Forest Company was properly joined as a coplaintiff by the Radio Corporation upon the twenty-fifth avernment of the bill. This makes it unnecessary for us to consider the argument on behalf of the appellee that the American Telephone Company was the owner of the patent, instead of the De Forest Company.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 4921 was amended by Act March 3, 1897, c. 391,  6, 29 Stat. 694 (Comp.

Dore, both of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought in a State Court seeking a common law remedy for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff, the respondent here, upon a vessel at dock \n\n[272 U.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n in the harbor of Seattle. The plaintiff was a longshoreman engaged in stowing freight in the hold. Through the negligence of the hatch tender no warning was given that a load of freight was about to be lowered, and when the load came down the plaintiff was badly hurt. The plaintiff and the hatch tender both were employed by the defendant stevedore, the petitioner here, and the defendant asked for a ruling that they were fellow servants and that therefore the plaintiff could not recover. The Court ruled that if the failure of the hatch tender to give a signal was the proximate cause of the injury the verdict must be for the plaintiff. A verdict was found for him and a judgment on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 134 Wash. 235, 245, 235 P. 360, 238 P. 581. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n269 \nU.S. 549\n, 46 S. Ct. 119.\n The petitioner argues that the case is governed by the admiralty law; that the admiralty law has taken up the common law doctrine as to fellow servants, and that by the common law the plaintiff would have no case. Whether this last proposition is true we do not decide. The petitioner cites a number of decisions of which it is enough to mention The Hoquiam, 253 F. 627, 165 C. C. A. 253, and Cassil v. United States Emergency Fleet Corporation (C. C. A.) 289 F. 774. It also refers to an intimation of this Court that whether the established doctrine be good or bad it is not open to courts to do away with it upon their personal notions of what is expedient. It is open to Congress, however, to change the rule and in our opinion it has done so. By the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250,  20, 41 Stat. 988, 1007 (Comp. St.  8337a):\n'Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his elelction, maintaion an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action election, maintain an action for damages at law, or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.'\n\n It is not disputed that the stat- \n\n[272 U.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n utes do away with the fellow servant rule in the case of personal injuries to railway employees. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. The question therefore is how far the Act of 1920 should be taken to extend.\n It is true that for most purposes, as the word is commonly used, stevedores are not 'seamen.' But words are flexible. The work upon which the plaintiff was engaged was a maritime service formerly rendered by the ship's crew. Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 62\n, 34 S. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1157. We cannot believe that Congress willingly would have allowed the protection to men engaged upon the same maritime duties to vary with the accident of their being employed by a stevedore rather than by the ship. The policy of the statute is directed to the safety of the men and to treating compensation for injuries to them as properly part of the cost of the business. If they should be protected in the one case they should be in the other. In view of the broad field in which Congress has disapproved and changed the rule introduced into the common law within less than a century, we are of opinion that a wider scope should be given to the words of the act, and that in this statute 'seamen' is to be taken to include stevedores employed in maritime work on navigable waters as the plaintiff was, whatever it might mean in laws of a different kind.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTEROCEAN OIL CO. v. U S(1926)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles E. Kern and John Paul Earnest, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[270 U.S. 65, 66]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., Alfred A. Wheat, and Randolph S. Collins, all of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims entered May 26, 1924, sustaining a demurrer filed by the United States, and dismissing the petition upon the ground that it does not state a cause of action. The facts stated in the petition are as follows:\n The appellant, the Interocean Oil Company, was in 1918 and before, engaged in refining, transporting and dealing in petroleum and petroleum products, chiefly fuel oil, at Carteret, N. J., where it owned and operated a refinery and storage tanks. It also had a refinery at Baltimore, Md. During the War, the corporation was represented in Baltimore by Harold F. Brown in the sale of oil to the Shipping Board and the United States Navy. Brown made arrangements with Maj. Ross of the Quartermaster's Department of the United States Army, acting under the direction of Col. Kimball, in charge, for the purchase by that department of fuel oil for army transports. After experiments made under the direction of Maj. Ross, a satisfactory grade of fuel oil was obtained by mixing the heavy gravity oil of this oil company with the light gravity oil of the Standard Oil Company. Maj. Ross then directed Brown to be prepared to furnish the full quantity of fuel oil required by the Quartermaster's Department. Ross complained that there was not enough storage for fuel oil at Baltimore. Brown advised him that the steel plates with which to erect the tanks could not be obtained on account of the War. Ross, finding that the company owned storage facilities at Carteret, demanded that they be removed to \n\n[270 U.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n Baltimore. In a conversation in April, 1918, Ross advised the officers of the company that the Quartermaster's Department was short of fuel oil and that there must be additional tankage, and that unless the tankage at Carteret was removed to Baltimore, the department would seize it and remove it itself as an exigency of war, but that, if the claimant was willing itself to transfer the tanks, it would be satisfactory to the department, and that all expense incurred and all losses sustained would be paid by the government. The company's officers advised Ross that the removal of the tanks would mean the destruction of its business at New York, but Ross said it would be compensated for all its loss and damage and that failure to remove the tanks would result in the department itself doing the work. The officers of the company were convinced that Ross was acting within the scope of his authority, because theretofore when he had given verbal orders to Brown for fuel oil, they had always been followed in due time by confirmatory written orders, and thereafter prompt payment had been made for the oil purchased. Indeed so accustomed was Brown to this that he had complied without question with every order, depending upon the future confirmation of it. In respect to the movement of the tanks, Ross said that he was authorized to act for the War Department, and that written official confirmation thereof would be forthcoming from that Department. When Ross' attention was called to the fact that these confirmatory orders had not come, he said it was an oversight and promised they would be forthcoming at once from Col. Kimball. Later he said he had made out the orders and delivered them to Col. Kimball, who would sign them as evidence that proper official authority was being exercised. They were never signed or delivered, however, and Col. Kimball left the service and went abroad because of ill health, and later died. The removal of the tanks was begun by the com- \n\n[270 U.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n pany with all dispatch, and it was far advanced when the Armistice was signed November 11, 1918. This made their use unnecessary for the purpose of the War Department. They were not re-erected and in condition for use at Baltimore until February, 1919\n\n\n The petition averred that the removal of the tanks from Carteret resulted in the claimant's losing its right to re-erect them at Carteret because of action of the Legislature of New Jersey and the local authorities. The items of damage included the actual expense incurred in taking down the plant at Carteret and its freight to Baltimore, and its re- erection there, which amounted to about $54,000. The claim made also included an item for the depreciation in the plant at Carteret of $220,000 and one for the loss of franchise to conduct business at Carteret and the profit on the probable sales of oil at Carteret for five years from April, 1918, to October, 1923, which was put at $2,300,000.\n It is contended on behalf of the claimant that the government got the benefit of the contract made between Ross and it, that it had the right to rely on Ross' authority, and that performance of the contract saved the necessity of a written agreement as required by Rev. St. s 3744 (Comp. St. s 6895). The petition set forth no facts upon which the United States can be said to have made any contract, whether oral or written, with the claimant company. There is no averment that Maj. Ross was authorized to make the contract upon which suit is brought. The averments are only that Ross told the officers of the company that he had the authority to make the contract, and that there would be a written confirmation by his chief, Col. Kimball. It is expressly admitted that no such written confirmation by Col. Kimball was ever signed or delivered to the company. The necessary effect of the lengthy averments of the petition is that Ross did not have authority to make a contract for the government such as that \n\n[270 U.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n sued on, but that the authority was vested in Col. Kimball and that until Col. Kimball signed the contract, it did not bind the government. All the statements of the petition united together are no more than to say that the company relied on the promise of Maj. Ross that Col. Kimball would confirm the contract which Ross proposed to make and said that he had authority subject to Kimball's confirmation to make. But Kimball never confirmed it.\n Nor is there any implied contract binding upon the government. The Oil Company was dealing with its own property in moving it from Carteret to Baltimore, and when the tanks were removed to Baltimore, they still belonged to the company for use by it not only in storing oil for the government but for any one else. There was no enrichment of the government to its knowledge, no benefit in the form of property given to it or of service rendered to it from which the contract by it to pay could be implied. The Court of Claims was right in sustaining the demurrer, and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nISELIN v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 119\nArgued: January 12, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. G. Pickering, Charles P. Howland, Eldon Bisbee, and Henry Root Stern, all of New York City, for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Metropolitan Opera House in New York City is owned by a corporation which leased it to the producing company. The use of all the parterre boxes was reserved by the lessor, with the privilege of six free admissions to each box at every performance. Before the passage of the Revenue Law of 1918, the lessor conferred upon Georgine Iselin, as owner of 300 of its shares, a license so to use a designated parterre box. During the season of 1919-20, being authorized so to do, she sold through a personal agent the license to use her box for 47 of the 70 performances given during the season, and received therefor $9,525 net after deduction of the agent's commissions. On the amount received Miss Iselin was assessed a tax of $3,352.50, under paragraph 3 of section 800 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1120- 1121 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 6309 5\/8 a). She paid the amount under protest and presented a claim that it be refunded. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected the application, holding that the tax was payable under paragraph 4 of that act. \n1\n Then Miss Iselin brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. A judgment \n\n[270 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n dismissing the petition, rendered upon findings of fact, was entered May 5, 1924. 59 Ct. Cl. 654. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1219).\n Paragraph 3 of section 800(a), under which the tax was assessed, provides:\n'Upon tickets or cards of admission to theaters, operas, and other places of amusement, sold at news stands, hotels, and places other than the ticket offices of such theaters, operas, or other places of amusement, at not to exceed 50 cents in excess of the sum of the established price therefor at such ticket offices plus the amount of any tax imposed under paragraph (1), a tax equivalent to 5 per centum of the amount of such excess; and if sold for more than 50 cents in excess of the sum of such established price plus the amount of any tax imposed under paragraph (1), a tax equivalent to 50 per centum of the whole amount of such excess, such taxes to be returned and paid, in the manner provided in s 903, by the person selling such ticket.'\n\n Neither stockholders' boxes nor tickets to them were on sale at any ticket office, as all the parterre boxes were reserved by the lease for the stockholders. For this reason there was no regular or established price for parterre boxes. Nor was any other box exactly like them on sale. Each sale of a stockholders' box or tickets was made as the individual transaction of a particular stockholder, for a particular performance, and to a designated purchaser. The price paid varied widely for different performances. There was, above the parterre boxes, a tier of boxes, known as the grand tier. These boxes, which were on sale at the ticket office, also had seats for six persons, were uniform in size with the stockholders' boxes, and were otherwise similar. The ticket office price for grand tier boxes was $60 for each performance. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, though sustaining the tax under paragraph 4, assessed the tax under paragraph 3, appar- \n\n[270 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n ently on the theory that Congress intended to tax sales of boxes like the plaintiff's; that, since there was no 'regular established price or charge' for boxes exactly like hers, and no such boxes were sold at the ticket office, the basis for taxation should be sought in the established price for the class of boxes actually on sale most like hers; that it should therefore be assumed that the box office price for the similar grand tier boxes was the 'established price at the ticket offices' of parterre boxes; and that, with such price as a standard, the calculation involved in determining the item of 'any tax imposed by paragraph (1),' and in assessing the supertax under paragraph (3) should be made. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Miss Iselin contended that section 800(a) had no application to stockholders' boxes or tickets; that the section provided for a tax only on the tickets customarily sold at box offices, for which there is an established price there, and which are commonly sold at news stands, hotels and other places of business for higher prices; that it was the purpose of Congress to impose a small tax upon tickets sold at the ticket office, a moderate tax on those sold at a moderate advance over the ticket office price, and a large tax upon any resale of admission tickets, if made at a price above a reasonable advance on the regular price, and also a large tax upon an original sale, if made at a price in excess of the regular or established price; that tickets issued under the peculiar circumstances stated, which were received by her as an incident of her investment in the lessor company and in return for obligations assumed by her as a stockholder to ensure performance of operas, were not within the purview of the section; that she was \n\n[270 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n not taxable at all, since her tickets had not been sold at a box office and there was no established price for them; but that if taxable, it could be only under paragraph 5, under which she had without protest paid a tax on these tickets amounting to $242.3\n The Court of Claims held that the tax was properly assessed under paragraph 3. It concluded that there was an 'established price' for box tickets of this character, and that Miss Iselin herself had established the price, because, prior to the assessment to her of the tax here in question, she had paid without protest a tax assessed under paragraph 5, the amount of which the government had determined by fixing $60 as the established price on which the tax so paid was calculated. The court held that the term 'established price' did not imply a fixing of the price by the producing company or others having the general power of establishing the prices of tickets; that it was of no legal significance that plaintiff had in fact made no sale at the price fixed in the assessment, that she had actually sold the tickets for the different performances at widely varying prices, and that no sale had been made of such tickets at the ticket office.\n The government concedes that neither paragraph 1, paragraph 3, paragraph 4, paragraph 5, or any other paragraph4 of section 800(a), provides in terms for taxing a \n\n[270 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n privilege like that enjoyed by the plaintiff. It makes no contention here that the tax can be sustained under any paragraph of section 800(a) unless it be paragraph 3. It argues that Congress clearly intended to tax all sales of tickets; that there is in the section no indication of intention to exempt from the tax any sale of tickets or any resale at a profit; that the receipts here taxed are in character substantially similar to those specifically described in paragraph 3; that this general purpose of Congress should be given effect, so as to reach any case within the aim of the legislation; and that the act should, therefore, be extended by construction to cover this case. It may be assumed that Congress did not purpose to exempt from taxation this class of tickets. But the act contains no provision referring to tickets of the character here involved; and there is no general provision in the act under which classes of tickets not enumerated are subjected to a tax. Congress undertook to accomplish its purpose by dealing specifically, and in some respects differently, with different classes of tickets and with tickets of any one class under different situations. The particularization and detail with which the scope of each provision, the amount of the tax thereby imposed, and the incidence of the tax, were specified, preclude an extension of any provision by implication to any other subject. The statute was evidently drawn with care. Its language is plain and unam- \n\n[270 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n biguous. What the government asks is not a construction of a statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope. To supply omissions transcends the judicial function. Compare United States v. Weitzel, 38 S. Ct. 381, \n246 U.S. 533\n, 543; Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 194, \n263 \nU.S. 528, 534\n, 535 S..\n The government calls attention to the fact that, as early as October 24, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made the ruling pursuant to which the tax here in question was assessed; that on March 22, 1920, the Attorney General sustained that ruling; that the provisions here in question were re-enacted without substantial change in the Revenue Act of 1921, Act Nov. 23, 1921, s 800(a), c. 136, 42 Stat. 227 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 6309 5\/8 a), and the Revenue Act of 1924, Act June 2, 1924, s 500(a), c. 234, 43 Stat. 253 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 6309 1\/2 d), and that the administrative practice adopted in 1919 has been steadfastly pursued. It suggests that these facts imply legislative recognition and approval of the executive construction of the statute. But the construction was neither uniform, general, nor long-continued; neither is the statute ambiguous. Such departmental construction cannot be given the force and effect of law. Compare United States v. G. Falk & Brother, 27 S. Ct. 191, \n204 U.S. 143\n; National Lead Co. v. United States, 40 S.

On January 15, 1920, the United States, through the Materials Disposal and Salvage Division of the office of the Director of Air Service, advertised for bids for 168,400 yards of aircraft linen, to be submitted February 2, 1920. The bidders were to be notified February 5th of the yardage awarded, and were then to forward a check for 10 per cent. of the purchase price, remainder within 30 days. The advertisement also stated that the materials would be sold 'as is' at points of storage, that inspection was invited, that specifications and quantities on hand were based upon best information available, but that no guaranty on behalf of the government was given.\n The representative of the appellants at New York on February 2, 1920, after seeing the advertisement, sent the following letter to the Salvage Division, office of the Director of Air Service, Washington:\n'I herewith submit my firm offer for approximately 168,400 yards of 38-inch grade A natural brown Irish airplane linen.

Attention is invited to the following rule of the Air Service, which requires that payment be made promptly and material removed within 30 days of award.'\n\n It does not appear, and it is not claimed, that there was any acceptance of appellant's bid February 2d otherwise than as embodied in the communication last above quoted.\n Upon resale of the linen, and appellants found that it was not of the quality of 'firsts' and brought this suit. The linen delivered was of grade A, which term describes a particular texture. The terms 'firsts' and 'seconds' are terms of quality.\n The only question in this case is whether the expression, 'Said linen as per sample submitted; goods to be firsts,' contained in the letter of February 2d was ac- \n\n[271 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n cepted so as to bind the government to a warranty that the linen sold was to be of first quality.\n We do not think that the letter of February 10th was an acceptance of the offer of February 2d. It does not acknowledge its receipt. It does not purport to be an answer to it. It differs from it in the yardage of the linen mentioned by 18,000 yards. It contains no reference to the quality of the linen. It refers to a check for 10 per cent. of the price bid on 150,400 yards of linen, which could not have been sent in the letter of February 2d, for it was for a less amount. This shows, as indeed the counsel for the appellants himself points out, that there must have been some negotiations, or inquiries or communications between the appellants and the government after the letter of February 2d before the exact amounts of the linen and the deposit check could be fixed. The contract is not found in the letter of February 2d. It is evidenced by the tender of the deposit check, by the letter of February 10th only, and by the payment of the balance due on the contract price. It is reasonable to infer that the letter of February 10th was a belated award under the advertisement rather than an acceptance of the letter of February 2d.\n It is well settled that a proposal to accept, or an acceptance upon terms varying from those offered, is a rejection of the offer, and puts an end to the negotiation, unless the party who made the original offer renews it, or assents to the modification suggested.

Duval, 14 Pet. 77, 82; Eliason v. Henshaw, 4 Wheat. 228.\n We must conclude that the government never entered into a warranty of the quality of the linen and so, that no obligation arose from a breach. The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAYBIRD MIN. CO. v. WEIR(1926)\nNo. 293\nArgued: April 29, 1926Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 609, 610]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. Scott Thompson, of Miami, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. John H. Venable, of Miami, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 609, 611]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The mining company sued in the district court of Ottawa county to recover a tax of $2,319.80 paid under protest. The county treasurer demurred to the petition asserting that if failed to state a cause of action. The demurrer was overruled, and judgment was given for the plaintiff. On appeal to the highest court of the state the \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 612]\n\u00a0\n judgment was reversed. 104 Okl. 271, 232 P. 425. The case is here on writ of error. Section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n Briefly the facts are these: September 26, 1896, pursuant to the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 188, 28 Stat. 876, 907, there was issued to Hum-bah- wat-tah Quapaw, a Quapaw Indian, a patent for an allotment of 40 acres of land in Ottawa county. The patent contained restrictions against alienation for 25 years, and by the Act of March 3, 1921, c. 119, 41 Stat. 1225, 1248, that period was extended for an additional 25 years. The land is owned by the heirs of the allottee. The company has a mining lease on the restricted land on terms which provide for the payment of royalties or a percentage of the gross proceeds derived from the sale of ores minded. The amount sued for is an ad valorem tax assessed by the county officials under section 9814, Compiled Statutes (Okl.) of 1921, on lead and zinc ores mined by the company in 1920, and which were in its bins on the land January 1, 1921. This tax is in addition to a gross production tax paid to the state auditor. It was assessed on the ores in mass, and the royalties or equitable interests of the Indians had not been paid or segregated. Prior to the production of the ores taxed, the Secretary of the Interior determined the Indian owners to be incapable of managing their property and assumed control of it in their behalf. Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 72. Since that time, the royalties have been paid directly to the secretary.\n The Quapaw Indians are under the guardianship of the United States. The land and Indian owners are bound by restrictions specified in the patent and the acts referred to. It is the duty and established policy of the government to protect these dependents in respect of their property. The restrictions imposed are in furtherance of that policy. United States v. Noble, \n237 U.S. 74\n. 35. S. Ct. 532; Goodrum v. Buffalo, 162 F. 817, 89 C. C. A. 525. The lessee is an \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 613]\n\u00a0\n agency or instrumentality employed by the government for the development and use of the restricted land and to mine ores therefrom for the benefit of its Indian wards. Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27. It is elementary that the federal government in all its activities is independent of state control. This rule is broadly applied; and, without congressional consent, no federal agency or instrumentality can be taxed by state authority. 'With regard to taxation, no matter how reasonable, or how universal and undiscriminating, the state's inability to interfere has been regarded as established since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (4 L. Ed. 579).' Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 55\n, 41 S. Ct. 16. And see Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516\n, 34 S. Ct. 354; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harison, supra; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S. Ct. 171.\n This court has considered a number of cases quite like the one now before us. In Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harrison, supra, there was an agreement by the United States that coal lands belonging in common to the members of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes should be mined, and that the royalties should be used for the Indians. The state imposed a tax equal to 2 per centum on the gross receipts from the total production of coal from the mine. It was held that it was an occupation or privilege tax, and that one having a mining lease made in furtherance of the governmental purpose could not be subjected to that burden. In Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S. Ct. 453, it was held that oil leases of land made by the Osage Tribe were under the protection of the federal government, and that the state could not tax such leases either directly or as represented by the capital stock of the corporation owning them. It was said (page 530 (36 S. Ct. 456)):\n'A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them. If they cannot be taxes as entities they cannot be taxed vicariously by taxing the stock, whose only value is their value, or \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 614]\n\u00a0\n by taking the stock as an evidence or measure of their value. ...'\n\n In Howard v. Oil Companies, \n247 \nU.S. 503\n, 38 S. Ct. 426, this court affirmed per curiam, the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma enjoining the enforcement of a tax imposed by the state on the gross value of the production of oil and gas, less the royalty interest, under leases upon Osage lands made for the benefit of the Indians. In Large Oil Co. v. Howard, \n248 \nU.S. 549\n, 39 S. Ct. 183, this court reversed, per curiam, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma (63 Okl. 143, 163 P. 537) sustaining a tax on gross value of production of petroleum and gas, less the royalty interest, where the owner of the property sought to be taxed was engaged under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior in the production of oil and gas in what formerly constituted the tribal lands of the Osage Nation. And in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, it was held that the net income derived by a lessee from the sale of his share of the oil and gas received under leases of restricted Creek and Osage lands could not be taxed by the state. In each of these cases the tax was condemned as an attempt to tax an instrumentality used by the United States in fulfilling its duties to the Indians.\n In this case the lease was made to secure the development of the lands and obtain for the benefit of the restricted Indian owners a percentage of the gross proceeds of the ores to be mined. The ad valorem tax here in controversy was assessed on the ores in mass at the mine before sale, and that was an attempt to tax an agency of the federal government within the principle of the cases cited.\n From abundance of caution the company presented a petition for a writ of certiorari; but, as a writ of error lies, the petition will be denied. Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, 506 (42 S. Ct. 171).\n Judgment reversed. \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 615]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the effect of the assailed tax upon the instrumentality of the United States is remote and tax is valid under the doctrine approved in Central Pac. R. R. v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91, 119\n, 16 S. Ct. 766.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The property taxed is lead and zinc ore in bins. The land from which the ore was extracted belongs to a Quapaw allottee under the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 188, 28 Stat. 876, 907. Restrictions on alienation of the land will not expire until 1946. Act of March 3, 1921, c. 119,  26, 41 Stat. 1225, 1248. But the allottee may lease the land for mining and business purposes for ten years unless he is incompetent, in which case the power to lease is vested in the Secretary of the Interior. Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 72. The ore in question had been detached from the soil and is personal property. It is owned wholly by the Mining Company, a private Oklahoma corporation organized for profit. The ore is assessed under the general laws of the state which lays an ad valorem property tax on all property, real or personal, not exempt by law from taxation. Payment of the tax will not affect the financial return to the Indian under the lease. No state legislation exempts this property. There is no specific or general provision in any act of Congress which purports to do so. If an exemption exists, it arises directly from the federal Constitution. Does ownership by an incompetent Indian of the land from which the ore was taken or ownership of the ore by an instrumentality of the government create an exemption?\n Is the ore exempt because it has been extracted out of restricted lands? The Quapaw might have conducted the mining operations himself. If he had been competent he might, without the approval of the Secretary of the Inte- \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 616]\n\u00a0\n rior have leased the land to others for mining purposes for a period of 10 years. If he had operated the mine himself, I see no ground on which it could be held that his ore in the bins would not have been taxable to him, like any other unrestricted property to which he had absolute title. \n1\n The fact that he was incompetent does not render such property exempt from taxation. \n2\n Such incompetency results simply in the imposition of restrictions upon the alienation of his realty, exempting that from taxation. The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737. But such restrictions cannot by implication be deemed to extend to personalty, even though the product of the realty, so as to exempt them from taxation. Compare McCurdy v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 263\n, 38 S. Ct. 289; United States v. Gray (C. C. A.) 284 F. 103; United States v. Ransom ( C. C. A.) 284 F. 108. Any exemption that attached to the land is limited thereto and does not extend to the ore extracted therefrom. Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 \nU.S. 762, 765\n, 766 S.. Compare South Utah Mines v. Beaver County, \n262 \nU.S. 325\n, 43 S. Ct. 577\n\n\n Is the ore exempt because it is the property of an agency employed by the government for the benefit of the Indian, its ward? We are not dealing here with property owned by the United States as in Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151\n, 6 S. Ct. 670; or Lee v. Osceola, etc., Improvement District, \n268 \nU.S. 643\n, 45 S. Ct. 620; nor with an agency all of whose property was acquired and is used solely for the purpose of serving the government as in Clallam County v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341\n, 44 S. Ct. 121. We are dealing with a private 'corporation having its own purposes as well as those of the United States and interested in profit \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 617]\n\u00a0\n on its own account.' 263 U. S. page 345, 44 S. Ct. 122. And we are dealing with a property tax, as distinguished from an occupation tax. Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Ry. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n226 \nU.S. 298, 301\n, 45 S. Ct. 101. Whether, under the circumstances, Congress had power to exempt the ore from the general property tax, we need not consider. It has not done so in terms; and I see no reason for assuming that it intended to do so. Compare Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker, \n268 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 45 S. Ct. 440; Thompson v. Kentucky, \n209 \nU.S. 340\n, 28 S. Ct. 533; Swarts v. Hammer, \n194 \nU.S. 441\n, 24 S. Ct. 695.\n In 1873 this court said:\n'It may, therefore, be considered as settled that no constitutional implications prohibit a state tax upon the property of an agent of the government merely because it is the property of such an agent.' Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 53 (21 L. Ed. 787).\n\n The rule there applied with respect to a railroad incorporated under a federal charter has since been followed as to other federal instrumentalities also. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 \nU.S. 530\n, 8 S. Ct. 961; Central Pacific Railroad Co. v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91\n, 16 S. Ct. 766; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 50; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362\n, 32 S. Ct. 499; Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Ry. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531, 537\n, 41 S. Ct. 582. Compare Thomason v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579; National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 362. It has been specifically applied to agencies, such as this mining company, whose employment was in aid of the government's policy of protecting and developing the properties of its Indian wards. Thomas v. Gay, \n169 \nU.S. 264\n, 18 S. Ct. 340; Wagoner v. Evans, \n170 \nU.S. 588\n, 18 S. Ct. 730; Catholic Missions v. Missoula County, \n200 \nU.S. 118\n, 26 S. Ct. 197. Those decisions seem to me controlling in the case at bar.\n The rule that the property of a privately owned government agency is not exempt from state taxation rests fundamentally upon the principle that such a tax has only a remote relation to the capacity of such agencies \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 618]\n\u00a0\n efficiently to serve the government. \n3\n Such a tax, as distinguished from an occupation or privilege tax, does not impose a charge upon the privilege of acting as a government agent and thereby enable a state to control the power of the federal government to employ agents and the power of persons to accept such employment. The tax is levied as a charge by the state for rendering services relating to the protection of the property, which services are rendered alike to agents of the government and of private persons. Such a tax cannot be deemed to be capable of deterring the entry of persons as agents into the employ of the government. Conceivably an operating company might pay a higher royalty or bonus if it were assured that it would enjoy immunity from taxation for the small quantity of the year's output of the mine which might be in the ore bins on the day as of which property is assessed. Conceivably also, the cattle owner in Thomas v. Gay, supra, might have paid higher for the grazing rights if the cattle while on the reservation were immune from taxation. But, in either case, the effect of the immunity, if any, upon the Indian's financial return would be remote and indirect. If we are to regard realities we should treat it as negligible. \n\n[271 U.S. 609, 619]\n\u00a0\n The difference in the legal effect of acts which are remote causes and of those which are proximate pervades the law. The power of a state to tax property and its lack of power to tax the occupation in which it is used exist in other connections. In Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375, 382\n, 25 S. Ct. 50, 52 (49 L. Ed. 242) where the state had levied a tax upon property conveyed by the United States to the Shipbuilding Company on the condition that it construct a dry dock there for the use of the United States and that, if such dry dock were not kept in repair, the property should revert to the United States, this court said: 'But, furthermore, it seems to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a state, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person, or its property, because it is employed by the United States, even if the work for which it is employed is important and takes much of its time.' I suspect that my brethren would agree with me in sustaining this tax on ore in the bins, but for Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171. The question there involved was different. Any language in the opinion which may seem apposite to the case at bar should be disregarded as inconsistent with the earlier decisions. It is a peculiar virtue of our system of law that the process of inclusion and exclusion, so often employed in developing a rule, is not allowed to end with its enunciation, and that an expression in an opinion yields later to the impact of facts unforeseen. The attitude of the court in this respect has been especially helpful when called upon to adjust the respective powers of the states and the nation in the field of taxation. \n4\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pennock v.

C.) 231 F. 270, rested upon the express ground that title to the property was held by the United States in trust for the Indians. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'It is, therefore, manifest that exemption of federal agencies from state taxation is dependent, not upon the nature of the agents, or upon the mode of their constitution, or upon the fact that they are agents, but upon the effect of the tax; that is, upon the question whether the tax does in truth deprive them of power to serve the government as they were intended to serve it, or does hinder the efficient exercise of their power. A tax upon their property has no such necessary effect. It leaves them free to discharge the duties they have undertaken to perform.

Bryson, of St. Louis, Mo., for Central Union Trust Co. of New York.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause is here on certificate from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216). The relevant facts and the submitted questions follow.\n In a proceeding by creditors, the United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, appointed a receiver for the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. Appellees asked foreclosure of liens upon the whole property, and procured an order of sale. According to a plan for purchase and reorganization, with definite offers to lien creditors, unsecured creditors, and stockholders, Blumenthal and another bid in the assets and then assigned the rights so acquired to the Missouri-Kansas- Texas Railroad Company, a newly organized Missouri corporation.\n Pending entry of the final decree, appellants asserted preferential rights. These were denied, and they were held to be unsecured contract creditors. Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 294 F. 32. Thereupon they challenged the reorganization plan as unfair to them and unduly preferential to stockholders of the insolvent corporation. The trial court overuled their objection, the matter went to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it has asked for instruction.\n The reorganization scheme required the issuance of four classes of securities by the new company:\n\n\n (1)\n Prior lien mortgage bonds (authorized, $250,000,000).\n\n\n (2)\n Cumulative adjustment, or income, bonds (authorized, $100,000,000 ), secured by mortgage as to principal.\n\n\n (3)\n Preferred stock (authorized, $200,000,000).\n\n\n (4)\n Common stock, without par value (authorized, 2,500,000 shares).\n Specified amounts of each of these were reserved for future use by the new company. Some of the prior lien \n\n[271 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n bonds bore interest at 4, some at 5, and some at 6 per cent.\n New securities were offered to the holders of seventeen separate issues of outstanding bonds of the old company and its various subsidiaries, secured by mortgage, and one issue of notes, secured by the pledge of mortgage bonds. In some cases, but not all, cash was offered to holders of these secured claims in addition to the new securities. Always the par amount of the new securities offered (taking the new nonpar value common stock at $100 per share), plus the cash offered, if any, equaled, but never exceeded, the principal amount of the old securities, in respect of which the offer was made, plus interest to January 1, 1922\n\n\n Of these eighteen outstanding issues, five were offered new prior lien bonds and cash; one was offered new prior lien bonds; five were offered new prior lien bonds and new adjustment bonds; three were offered new prior lien bonds, new adjustment bonds, and new preferred stock; one was offered new adjustment bonds and new preferred stock; three were offered new adjustment bonds, new preferred stock, and new common stock.\n In all cases the new prior lien bonds and the new adjustment bonds ( whether offered to secured creditors, unsecured creditors, or stockholders) were to bear interest from January 1, 1922.\n As to stockholders and unsecured creditors, it was provided: (1) Preferred stockholders might receive $14 in prior lien bonds (bearing 6 per cent.), $6 in adjustment bonds, and one share of common stock in the new company, upon payment of $20 for each $100 share of old stock. (2) Common stockholders might receive $17,50 in 6 per cent. prior lien mortgage bonds, $7.50 in adjustment bonds, and one share of common stock, upon payment of $25 for each $100 share of old stock. (3) Unsecured creditors were given the choice of two plans: \n\n[271 U.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n (a) One-third of a share of preferred stock, $100 par value, and two- thirds of a share of common stock without par value, for each $100 of their claims, plus interest to January 1, 1922 (whereas the receiver was appointed and took possession of the property September 27, 1915, foreclosure decree was entered June 30, 1922, offer to creditors was dated July 15, 1922, foreclosure sale was had December 13, 1922, order confirming the sale was entered February 9, 1923, and order approving the master's deed conveying the property to the new company was entered on March 10, 1923); (b) $14 in prior lien mortgage 6 per cent. bonds, $6 in adjustment mortgage bonds, and one share of common stock, upon payment of $ 18 for each $100 of their claims.\n Appellants maintained below that Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S. Ct. 554, and Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville Railway Co., \n174 \nU.S. 674\n, 19 S. Ct. 827, require that an offer in a reorganization plan, in order to be fair and binding upon him, must preserve 'to the creditor his relative priority over the stockholder. It is not sufficient that he should get a little more than the stockholder. His entire claim must take precedence over any part of the interest of a stockholder. It is not sufficient that he be offered securities of the same grade as the stockholder, but a trifle more in amount, or that the stockholder's right to participate be conditioned upon the payment of an assessment.'\n The questions:\n I. Is a plan of reorganization of a railway company sufficient as to unsecured creditors, and binding upon them, which does not give precedence to the entire claim of the creditor over any part or interest of a stockholder in the old company?\n II. Is such a plan fair and binding upon such creditors, even though they be offered securities of the same grade as the stockholders, the difference being only in the \n\n[271 U.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n greater amount offered the creditors, provided the court shall be of the opinion that the offer tenders to such creditors all that could reasonably be expected under all of the existing circumstances?\n III. Is such offer as to such creditors fair and binding, if it consists only of the same grade of securities as offered the stockholders, the difference being that the right of the stockholders to participate is conditioned upon the payment of an assessment or the payment of a relatively greater assessment than that asked of such creditors, provided the court shall be of the opinion that the offer tenders to such creditor all that could reasonably be expected under all of the existing circumstances?\n These questions lack precision, and the accompanying statement of facts fails to reveal the detail of the situation with desirable clearness. There is nothing to show the amount or character of the insolvent company's outstanding securities, or the amount of the unsecured indebtedness, or the probable value of the equity in the property beyond secured debts, or the amount of money deemed necessary to insure successful operation of the new company. The questions, therefore, must be defined and answered with certain qualifications.\n Chicago, etc., Railroad Co. v. Howard, 7 Wall. 392, 1. L. Ed. 117, Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville Railway Co., \n174 \nU.S. 674\n, 19 S. Ct. 827, and Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S. Ct. 554, gave much consideration to the general principles which must control the present cause. These were applied in Kansas City, etc., Railway Co. v. Guardian Trust Co., \n240 \nU.S. 166\n, 36 S. Ct. 334, and Pierce v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 398\n, 41 S. Ct. 365.\n We accept those opinions as authoritative, and it now may be announced as settled doctrine that, where the value of corporate property to be sold under foreclosure is so great as to render co-operation between bondholders and stockholders essential in order to secure a bidder and \n\n[271 U.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n prevent undue sacrifice of their interests, they may enter into a fair and open arrangement to that end. But 'no such proceedings can be rightfully carried to consummation which recognize and preserve any interest in the stockholders, without also recognizing and preserving the interests, not merely of the mortgagee, but of every creditor of the corporation. In other words, if the bondholder wishes to foreclose and exclude inferior lienholders, or general unsecured creditors and stockholders, he may do so; but a foreclosure which attempts to preserve any interest or right of the mortgagor in the property after the sale must necessarily secure and preserve the prior rights of general creditors thereof. This is based upon the familiar rule that the stockholder's interest in the property is subordinate to the rights of creditors, first of secured and then of unsecured creditors. And any arrangement of the parties by which the subordinate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either class of creditors comes within judicial denunciation.' Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville Railway Co., \n174 U.S. 683\n, 684 (19 S. Ct. 830).\n This doctrine is the 'fixed principle' according to which Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, \n228 U.S. 507\n (33 S. Ct. 554), declares the character of reorganization agreements must be determined, and to it there should be rigid adherence. But, as that opinion states, this does not require the impossible, and make it necessary always to pay unsecured creditors in cash before stockholders may retain any interest whatever in the reorganized company. By way of illustration it further pointed out, that such creditors can be protected 'by the issuance, on equitable terms, of income bonds or preferred stock.' And we now add that, when necessary, they may be protected through other arrangements, which distinctly recognize their equitable right to be preferred to stockholders against the full value of all property belonging to the debtor corporation, and afford each of them \n\n[271 U.S. 445, 455]\n\u00a0\n fair opportunity, measured by the existing circumstances, to avail himself of this right.\n Unsecured creditors of insolvent corporations are entitled to the benefit of the values which remain after lienholders are satisfied, whether this is present or prospective, for dividends or only for purposes of control. But reasonable adjustments should be encouraged. Practically, it is impossible to sell the property of a great railroad for cash and, generally, the interests of all parties, including the public, are best served by co-operation between bondholders and stockholders. If creditors decline a fair offer based upon the principles above stated, they are left to protect themselves. After such refusal they cannot attack the reorganization in a court of equity. Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, \n228 U.S. 508\n (33 S. Ct. 554).\n Question I, if interpreted strictly and according to the ordinary meaning of the words employed, must be answered in the negative. We assume that to 'give precedence' implies recognition of superior importance. As above stated, to the extent of their debts creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders against all the property of an insolvent corporation. But it does not follow that in every reorganization the securities offered to general creditors must be superior in rank or grade to any which stockholders may obtain. It is not impossible to accord to the creditor his superior rights in other ways. Generally, additional funds will be essential to the success of the undertaking, and it may be impossible to obtain them, unless stockholders are permitted to contribute and retain an interest sufficiently valuable to move them. In such or similar cases the chancellor may exercise an informed discretion concerning the practical adjustment of the several rights.\n Question II is answered in the affirmative, with the qualifications which follow. The primary right of unsecured creditors to the assets of an insolvent corporation \n\n[271 U.S. 445, 456]\n\u00a0\n remaining after lienholders are satisfied, must be adequately protected, and to each one of them there must be given such opportunity as the circumstances permit to secure the full enjoyment of this preference.\n Question III is also answered in the affirmative, subject to the following qualification. No offer is fair which does not recognize the prior rights of creditors, as above pointed out; but circumstances may justify an offer of different amounts of the same grade of securities to both creditors and stockholders. Whenever assessments are demanded, they must be adjusted with the purpose of according to the creditor his full right of priority against the corporate assets, so far as possible in the existing circumstances. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEITH v. JOHNSON(1926)\nNo. 295\nArgued: January 6, 1926Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., Newton K. Fox. A. W. Gregg, and W. H. Trigg, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sidney V. Lowell, of Brooklyn, N. Y. (Messrs. Harrison Tweed and Benjamin Mahler, both of New York City, of counsel), for respondent.\n Messrs. John M. Perry, C. Alexander Capron, Russell L. Bradford, and Walter F. Taylor, all of New York City, amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1917, John B. Johnson, a resident of New York, died intestate. Respondent was appointed administratrix and in that year paid to the state $ 233,044.20, the transfer tax imposed pursuant to article 10, Tax Law ( chapter 60, Consolidated Laws). When respondent made the income tax return for the estate for 1917 (Revenue Act 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 757 (Comp. St.  6336a et seq.)), she claimed that the state transfer tax paid in that year was deductible; but, yielding to the regulations of the Treasury Department, she did not make the deduction, and under protest paid to the United States an income tax calculated on $164,958.00, amounting to $30, 985.53. If the deduction had been made there would have been no taxable income. This action was brought to recover the amount paid. The District Court gave respondent judgment which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Under the Revenue Act of 1916, the income of the estate for 1917 during administration was subject to a tax to be assessed against the administratrix. She was required to pay the tax and was indemnified against claims of beneficiaries for the amount paid. Section 2(b). It is provided that in computing net income, in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, for the purpose of the tax there shall be allowed as deductions the taxes imposed by the authority of the United States or of any state and paid within the year. Section 5(a) Third. Administrators and other fiduciaries are subject to all the provisions which apply to individuals. Section 8(c). \n\n[271 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n In United States v. Woodward, 41 S. Ct. 615, \n256 U.S. 632\n, it was held that the federal estate taxes imposed by the Revenue Act of 1916 are deductible in ascertaining net taxable income received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement. Revenue Act 1918, title 2 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 a et seq.). The court said (41 S. Ct. 616, 256 U. S. p. 635):\n'It (the estate tax) is made a charge on the estate and is to be paid out of it by the administrator or executor substantially as other taxes and charges are paid. ... It does not segregate any part of the estate from the rest and keep it from passing to the administrator or executor for purposes of administration, ... but is made a general charge on the gross estate and is to be paid in money out of any available funds or, if there be none, by converting other property into money for the purpose.'\n\n The government contends that the state transfer tax is not imposed on the estate and is not deductible in calculating the federal tax on the income of the estate.\n The transfer tax law imposes a tax 'upon the transfer of property' from the deceased (section 220) at rates graduated, according to the amount transferred to each beneficiary and the relationship, or absence of any, between the deceased and beneficiaries. Sections 221, 221(a). Until paid the tax is a lien upon the property of the deceased. The person to whom the property is transferred is made personally liable for the tax. The personal representatives of the deceased are personally liable for the tax until its payment; they are authorized to sell the property of the estate to obtain money to pay the tax in the same manner as they may to pay debts of the deceased. Section 224.1 \n\n[271 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n They are not entitled to discharge until the tax is paid. Section 236. The law plainly makes it their duty to pay the tax out of the estate. The property remaining passes to the beneficiaries. When property is transferred without the deduction of the tax the beneficiary is required to pay. But, by whomsoever the amount may be handed over to the state, the tax is in effect an appropriation by the state of a part of the property of the deceased at the time of death, and the state's portion is deductible from the legacy and does not pass to the legatee. If money is transferred the tax is withheld; property other than money passes subject to the transfer tax. Cf. Matter of Estate of Swift, 32 N. E. 1096, 137 N. Y. 77, 83, 18 L. R. A. 709. In Matter of Marriam, 36 N. E. 505, 141 N. Y. 479, a bequest to the United States was \n\n[271 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n held subject to the tax. The court said (36 N. E. 506, 141 N. Y. 484):\n'This tax, in effect, limits the power of testamentary disposition, and legatees and devisees take their bequests and devises subject to this tax imposed upon the succession of property. This view eliminates from the case the point urged by the appellant that to collect this tax would be in violation of the well-established rule that the state cannot tax the property of the United States. Assuming this legacy vested in the United States at the moment of testator's death, yet in contemplation of law the tax was fixed on the succession at the same instant of time. This is not a tax imposed by the state on the property of the United States. The property that vests in the United States under this will is the net amount of its legacy after the succession tax is paid.'\n\n That case was brought to this court on writ of error. United States v. Perkins, 16 S. Ct. 1073, \n163 U.S. 625\n. Following the decisions of the New York court it was held that the transfer tax is not imposed on property but on the transfer, and that the property does not pass to the heirs or legatees until, by the enforced contribution to the state, it has suffered diminution to the amount of the tax. And see Prentiss v. Eisner (D. C.) 260 F. 589, affirmed (C. C. A.) 267 F. 16; People v. Fraser, 40 N. E. 165, 145 N. Y. 593, affirming 26 N. Y. S. 814, 74 Hun, 282.\n The government cites New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 41 S. Ct. 506, \n256 U.S. 345\n, 16 A. L. R. 660. In that case there was involved the amount of the federal estate tax under section 201 of the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 777 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/2 b). Section 203 (Comp. St .  6336 1\/2 d) provided that there should be deducted from the value of the gross estate funeral expenses, administration expenses, claims against the estate, certain losses, 'and such other charges against the estate as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction' where the estate was administered. When that case was before this court the latest decision of the New York Court of Appeals, having a direct bearing upon the matter, was Matter of Gihon, 62 N. E. 561, 169 N. Y. \n\n[271 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n 443. It was there held that the state transfer tax was the same as the federal inheritance tax imposed by the War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, which was considered by this court in Knowlton v. Moore, 20 S. Ct. 747, \n178 U.S. 41\n; that the tax was not primarily payable out the estate; that it was a tax not upon property but upon succession, 'that is to say, a tax on the legatee for the privilege of succeeding to property,' and that payment of the tax by the personal representative was for the legatee and not on account of the estate. In harmony with that case this court held that the state transfer tax paid by the executors was not deductible in calculating the amount of the federal estate tax. Since then the courts of New York, notwithstanding the Gihon Case, have construed the statute in harmony with the earlier decisions of the New York courts and United States v. Perkins, supra.\n In Home Trust Co. v. Law, 198 N. Y. S. 710, 204 App. Div. 590, the court considered the state law which imposes an income tax on individuals ( Tax Law,  351, as added by Laws N. Y. 1919, c. 627), and makes that tax applicable to income of estates of deceased persons received during administration. Section 365, as added by Laws N. Y. 1919, c. 627. It is shown that the state income tax and deductions (section 360 as added by Laws N. Y. 1919, c. 627) from gross earnings, authorized to be made to determine the amount of the taxable income of the estate, are patterned after the corresponding federal taxes and deductions; and, following the decision of this court in United States v. Woodward, supra, it was held that, since the federal estate tax paid is deductible to arrive at the income of the estate subject to the federal tax, the state transfer tax should be held to be deductible in ascertaining the income of the estate taxable under the state law. The court said (198 N. Y. S. 712, 204 App. Div. 594):\n'Aside from authority and theory we think it was the clear legislative intent, as indicated by the various provisions of the Tax Law, that in calculating the net income of the estate of a decedent \n\n[271 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n for income tax purposes, the amount paid by an executor during the year in satisfaction of a transfer tax should be deducted. The income tax payment is made by the executor of the estate from funds of the estate and not from funds belonging to legatees. Kings County Trust Co. v. Law (194 N. Y. S. 370) 201 App. Div. 181. The transfer tax payment is made by the executor from the funds of the estate. 'The transfer tax is imposed upon the estate of the decedent as it exists at the hour of his death, and its value is to be fixed as of that time.' Matter of Hubbard (134 N. E. 17) 234 N. Y. 179. Thus the tax is measurable not by the funds received by a legatee, but by the funds the executor receives. As the burden of paying the income tax, as well as the burden of paying the transfer tax is cast upon the executor, and as the taxable income of the estate is under the terms of the Tax Law measurable by gross income received less taxes paid, it would seem clear that the person paying the income tax, namely, the executor, is entitled to deduct the very transfer tax which he himself pays.'\n\n This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals without opinion. 142 N. E. 303, 236 N. Y. 607.\n This court will follow the decisions of the state courts as to the meaning and proper application of the state transfer tax law, any expressions in its earlier decision to the contrary notwithstanding. Green v. Lessee of Neal, 6 Pet. 291, 298, 299; Fairfield v. County of Gallatin, \n100 U.S. 47\n; Edward Hines Trustees v. Martin, 45 S. Ct. 543, \n268 U.S. 458\n, 464\n\n\n By indicating that the latest decisions of the state courts will be followed here as binding, it is not intended to intimate that a different view is entertained as to the construction properly to be given the state law. In fact we agree with that construction; and feel justified in so saying as the same question arises in another case-No. 470, the opinion in which is announced concurrently with this one-on a substantially similar statute of a state where there has been no authoritative construction by \n\n[271 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n the state courts. Compare Harrigan v. Bergdoll, No. 181, 46 S. Ct. 413, \n270 U.S. 560\n, decided this day. And we are of opinion that the transfer tax is deductible. It was primarily payable by the respondent out of moneys and other property of the estate; and it was so paid by her. While this lessens the amount for distribution among the heirs, it cannot be said that they bore any part of that tax. As well might it be claimed that they paid the funeral expenses and debts, if any, of the intestate. No part of the transfer tax so paid could be taken by the heirs as a deduction in claculating their federal income taxes. It follows that the amount of the tranfer tax paid in 1917 by the respondent was deductible in ascertaining the taxable income of the estate received by her in that year.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Lien of Tax and Collection by Executors, Administrators and Trustees. Every such tax shall be and remain a lien upon the property transferred until paid and the person to whom the property is so transferred, and the executors, administrators and trustees of every estate so transferred shall be personally liable for such tax until its payment. Every executor, administrator or trustee shall have full power to sell so much of the property of the decedent as will enable him to pay such tax in the same manner as he might be entitled by law to do for the payment of the debts of the testator or intestate. Any such executor, administrator or trustee having in charge or in trust any legacy or property for distribution subject to such tax shall deduct the tax therefrom and shall pay over the same to the state comptroller or county treasurer, as herein provided. If such legacy or property be not in money, he shall collect the tax thereon upon the appraised value thereof from the person entitled thereto. He shall not deliver or be compelled to deliver any specific legacy or property subject to tax under this article to any person until he shall have collected the tax thereon. If any such legacy shall be charged upon or payable out of real property, the heir or devisee shall deduct such tax therefrom and pay it to the executor, administrator or trustee, and the tax shall remain a lien or charge on such real property until paid; and the payment thereof shall be enforced by the executor, administrator or trustee in \n the same manner that payment of the legacy might be enforced, or by the district attorney under section two hundred and thirty-five of this chapter. If any such legacy shall be given in money to any such person for a limited period, the executor, administrator or trustee shall retain the tax upon the whole amount, but if it be not in money, he shall make application to the court having jurisdiction of an accounting by him, to make an apportionment, if the case require it, of the sum to be paid into his hands by such legatees, and for such further order relative thereto as the case may require. \n\n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL.

Serious injury resulted to the latter and its cargo. February 19, 1921, relying upon the Suits in Admiralty Act of March 9, 1920 (chapter 95, 41 Stat. 525 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, ss 1251 1\/4- 1251 1\/4 l)), the owners seek to recover damages. The Act of March 3, 1925, c. 428, 43 Stat. 1112 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, ss 1251 3\/4-1 to 1251 3\/4-10), is not applicable. They allege that the collision resulted from the fault of the Antigone. Also that-\n At all the times mentioned herein prior to the 13th day of October, 1919, and particularly on the 9th day of October, 1919, the date of the collision hereinafter mentioned, the steamship Antigone was owned by a private person or merchant who was solely entitled to the immediate and lawful possession, operation, and control of said vessel. At no time prior to said 13th day of October, 1919, was the said steamship Antigone owned, either absolutely or pro hac vice, by the United States of America, nor by any corporation in which the United States of America or its representatives owned the entire outstanding capital stock, nor lawfully in the possession of the United States of America or of such corporation, nor lawfully operated by or for the United States of America or such corporation. On the 13th day of October, 1919, the respondent United States of America became, ever since has been, and now is in the lawful possession of the steamship Antigone, but at no time has the United States of America held the legal title to or been the absolute owner of said steamship Antigone. \n\n[270 U.S. 215, 224]\n\u00a0\n The United States appeared specially and suggested that when the collision occurred they owned, possessed, and controlled, the Antigone, and therefore the court was without jurisdiction. This was denied, and evidence was taken upon the consequent issue. Having considered the evidence, the court held that the United States owned the vessel and were navigating her, with a crew employed by the War Department, in transporting supplies and troops. The libels were accordingly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n If the established facts show such ownership, possession, and control, then, under the doctrine of The Western, Maid, 42 S. Ct. 159, \n257 U.S. 419\n, to which we adhere, the decree is clearly right.\n The history of the matter is this. The Antigone-then the privately- owned German merchantman Neckar-took refuge within the United States prior to April 6, 1917, when war with Germany was declared. By Joint Resolution of May 12, 1917, c. 13, 40 Stat. 75, being Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, ss 8146rr, 8146s (copied in the margin1), Congress authorized the President to take over to the United States the immediate possession and title of any vessel within their jurisdiction which at the time of coming therein was owned by any corporation, citizen or subject of an enemy nation, or was under register of any such nation. By Executive Order of June 30, 1917, the President affirmed that the Neckar was \n\n[270 U.S. 215, 225]\n\u00a0\n such a vessel, and ordered that 'the possession and title' be taken over through the United States Shipping Board. He further authorized that board to repair, equip, man, and operate her. It accordingly took her, July 17, 1917, and thereafter a naval board appraised her. Subsequently she was transferred to the Navy Department, renamed the Antigone, and later transferred to the Army Transport Service. October 9, 1919, she sailed under a master, officers and crew of the United States Transport Service from New York bound for Brest, from which port she was to return with troops.\n Appellants say that the rules of international law as recognized by the United States forbade them from confiscating German vessels within their jurisdiction at outbreak of the war, and that the Resolution of May 12, 1917, should be so interpreted as to harmonize with these rules. They further insist that thus interpreted the Resolution only gave authority to detain and operate the Antigone as enemy property, leaving title in the original German owners and the vessel subject to ordinary maritime liens. Our attention is called to the course pursued by the British government and to certain decisions of their courts. The Chile, 1 Br. & Col. Prize Cases, 1; The Gutenfels, 2 Br. & Col. Prize Cases, 36; The Prinz Adalbert, 3 Br. & Col. Prize Cases, 70, 72; The Blonde (1922) L. R. 1 A. C. 313, 334. \n\n[270 U.S. 215, 226]\n\u00a0\n Both Great Britain and Germany were parties to Convention VI of the Second Hague Peace Conference, 1907,2 and the action of the former, referred to by counsel, was taken in view of obligations thus assumed. The United States did not approve that convention, and the cited cases involved problems wholly different from the one here presented.\n It is unnecessary to consider how far the ancient rules of international law concerning confiscation of enemy property have been modified by recent practices. In the absence of convention every government may pursue what policy it thinks best concerning seizure and confiscation of enemy ships in its harbors when war occurs. The Hague Conference (1907) recognized this and sought by agreement to modify the rule. The Blonde, supra, page 326. Our problem is to determine the result of action taken under a joint resolution of Congress whose language is very plain and refers only to enemy vessels. It authorized the President to take 'possession and title,' and, obeying, he took them. We do not doubt the right of any independent nation so to do without violation any \n\n[270 U.S. 215, 227]\n\u00a0\n uniform or commonly accepted rule of international law; and Congress had power to authorize the action irrespective of any general views theretofore advanced in behalf of this government. Certainly all courts within the United States must recognize the legality of the seizure; the duly expressed will of Congress when proceeding within its powers is the supreme law of the land.\n Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 122 (3 L. Ed. 504):\n'That war gives to the sovereign full right to take the persons and confiscate the property of the enemy wherever found, is conceded. The mitigations of this rigid rule, which the humane and wise policy of modern times has introduced into practice, will more or less affect the exercise of this right, but cannot impair the right itself. That remains undiminished, and when the sovereign authority shall choose to bring it into operation, the judicial department must give effect to its will. But until that will shall be expressed no power to condemnation can exist in the court.'\n\n See Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268; The Blonde, supra.\n The decree of the court below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the President be, and he is hereby, authorized to take over to the United States the immediate possession and title of any vessel within the jurisdiction thereof, including the Canal Zone and all territories and insular possessions of the United States except the American Virgin Islands, which at the time of coming into such jurisdiction was owned in whole or in part by any corporation, citizen, or subject of any nation with which the United States may be at war when such vessel shall be taken, or was flying the flag of or was under register of any such nation or any political subdivision or municipality thereof; and, through the United States Shipping Board, or any department or agency of the government, to operate, lease, charter, and equip such vessel in any service of the United States, or in any commerce, foreign, or coastwise.\n Sec. 2.

IRON MINES v. LORD(1926)\nNo. 336\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 577, 578]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, John W. Beaumont, of Detroit, Mich., and George W.

Youngquist, and Clifford L. Hilton, all of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By their several bills in the United States District Court, appellants alleged the invalidity of chapter 226, Laws of Minnesota, approved April 11, 1923, because of conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment and the state Constitution. They sought to prevent its enforcement. That court held the enactment valid, and by decrees en- \n\n[271 U.S. 577, 579]\n\u00a0\n tered January 15, 1925, dismissed the bills. These appeals followed.\n The challenged act (fourteen sections), effective from its passage, provides-\n'Sec. 1. There shall be levied and collected upon all royalty received during the year ending December 31, 1923, and upon all royalty received during each calendar year thereafter, for permission to explore, mine, take out and remove ore from land in this state, a tax of six (3) per cent.\n\n'Sec. 2. For all purposes of this act the word 'royalty' shall be construed to mean the amount in money or value of property received by any person having any right, title or interest in or to any tract of land in this State for permission to explore, mine, take out and remove ore therefrom; and the word 'person' shall be construed to include individuals, copartnerships, associations, companies and corporations.'\n\n Succeeding sections relate to reports to the tax commission, method of assessment, penalties, date of payment, etc. Section 5 provides:\n'A person subletting land for the use of which he received royalty shall be required to pay taxes only on the difference between the amount of royalty paid by him and the amount received.'\n\n And section 8:\n'The situs of royalty for all purposes of this act shall be in this state, and the tax herein provided for shall be a specific lien from the time the same is due and payable upon all and singular the right, title, and interest of the person to whom such royalty is payable, in and to the land for permission to explore, mine, take out and remove ore on which the royalty is paid.'\n\n Article 9,  1, Constitution of Minnesota:\n'The power of taxation shall never be surrendered, suspended or contracted away. Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and shall be levied and collected for public purposes. ...' \n\n[271 U.S. 577, 580]\n\u00a0\n Extensive areas in northeastern Minnesota contain beds of rich iron ore and derive their chief value therefrom. Titles to these lands are held by many resident and nonresident individuals and corporations. For many years these owners have followed the common practice of making long-term leases (ordinarily 50 years) to parties who agree to mine the ore and pay the lessor, or his successors, at some designated place, a specified amount (12.5 cent to $1.25), or royalty, for each ton removed. Some lessees have made subleases, reserving to themselves something above what they are obligated to pay.\n\n Great bodies of ore are now subject to such leases, or conveyances of similar import, and every year millions of tons are mined thereunder, most of which goes out of the state. The consequent royalties are very large-$ 16,000,000 during 1923\n\n\n In 1921 the Minnesota Legislature adopted the Occupation Tax Act- chapter 223. It prescribes a charge upon those who engage in mining, amounting to 6 per centum of the value of the ore extracted and removed, after deducting costs of operation and royalties. Oliver Iron Mining Co. et al. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S. Ct. 526, sustained this act. The Legislature evidently intended that chapter 226, Laws of 1923, should supplement chapter 223, Laws of 1921, and thus secure payment to the state of 6 per centum upon the value of all extracted ores, less the expense of raising them. If the owner operates, he must pay this 6 per centum, under the Occupation Tax Act; if a lessee mines, the act requires him to pay the same amount less royalty. The act of 1923 lays a charge of 6 per centum upon the royalty. See State v. Armson (Minn.) 207 N. W. 727, 731.\n Appellants-corporate and individual-receive royalties from iron mines, under lease or similar contracts, at designated places, sometimes within and sometimes without the state. Some of them reside within the state and \n\n[271 U.S. 577, 581]\n\u00a0\n some without. Some own the fee; some are lessees, who have executed subleases. They maintain that the tax prescribed by chapter 226 of 1923 is not laid uniformly upon the same class of subjects, as required by the state Constitution; that its enforcement would deprive them of the equal protection of the laws and of property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment; and that it impairs the obligation of their contracts and thereby violates article 1,  10, of the federal Constitution.\n Titles to all the lands and leases were obtained subject to the state's power to tax. If the statute now in controversy is within that power, it cannot impair the obligation of appellants' contracts; if beyond, it is, of course, invalid. Accordingly, there is no occasion further to discuss the application of article 1,  10.\n The only provision of the Minnesota Constitution which undertakes to limit the power of taxation is in article 9,  1:\n'Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and shall be levied and collected for public purposes.'\n\n The state courts have said nothing to the contrary, and it seems to us sufficiently plain that this provision goes no further than the Fourteenth Amendment. Consequently, if the legislation under review does not offend that amendment there is no conflict with the state Constitution.\n In Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503\n, 37 S. Ct. 201, we considered mining leases like those now before us and pointed out that under the Minnesota decisions their avails are regarded as rents and profits of the land, 'the compensation which the occupier pays the landlord for the species of occupation which the contract between them allows.' Ultimate construction of chapter 226 is for the state courts, but, in the absence of that, we think the enactment may be reasonably interpreted as laying a tax upon interests in mineral lands from which permission \n\n[271 U.S. 577, 582]\n\u00a0\n has been given to extract ores upon payment of royalty. The amount of the exaction is determined by reference to the sum actually received for the use of such interests.\n As the tax is laid upon land, neither the owner's residence nor the place fixed for payment of the royalty is important.\n The remaining question is whether the Legislature may treat ore lands as a distinct class of property and impose upon them a tax, not extended to quarries, forests, etc., without depriving their owners of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. And this question must be answered in the affirmative, under the principles announced in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S. Ct. 83, where we sustained a tax confined to anthracite coal against the objection of arbitrary classification in that bituminous coal was not included. The state Legislature may exercise wide discretion in selecting the subjects of taxation (Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 179\n, 43 S. Ct. 526), so long as it refrains from clear and hostile discrimination against particular persons or classes ( Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Ct. 533). Certainly, ores differ as much from other products of the land as anthracite coal does from the bituminous variety, and ore gives character to appellants' holdings. Lands chiefly valuable for ore are depreciated by its extraction, and probably will yield less and less under an ad valorem tax as the mining continues. The situation is very different where the principal value depends on other uses which do not deplete. The selection of the business of mining only, for imposition of the occupation tax, was not arbitrary, and certainly we cannot say that the classification by the legislation now assailed was without any reasonable basis.\n There is nothing to show purpose by the state officers to insist upon a construction or application of the statute which will deprive appellants of their constitutional \n\n[271 U.S. 577, 583]\n\u00a0\n rights, and, considering the true construction of the act, no ground appears which would justify an injunction to prevent them from proceeding with its orderly enforcement.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAMBERT v.

The limitation as to amount applies only to alcoholic liquor 'fit for use for beverage purposes.' National Prohibition Act, tit. 2,  1 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2). 'Medicinal preparations manufactured in accordance with formulas \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 588]\n\u00a0\n prescribed by the United States Pharmacopoeia, National Formulary or the American Institute of Homeopathy that are unfit for use for beverage purposes,' and 'patented, patent, and proprietary medicines that are unfit for use for beverage purposes,' are specifically exempted from the operation of the provision. Title 2,  4(b) and (c), being Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 b. Moreover, the limitation does not apply to prescriptions for such liquor to be administered in certain hospitals. Title 2,  6 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 c).\n In November, 1922, Samuel W. Lambert, of New York City, a distinguished physician, brought in the federal court for that district this suit to enjoin Edward Yellowley, the acting federal prohibition director, and other officials, 'from interfering with complainant in his acts as a physician in prescribing vinous or spirituous liquors to his patients for medicinal purposes, upon the ground that the quantities prescribed for the use of any one person in any period of ten days exceed the limits fixed by said acts, or either of them.' As the basis for this relief the bill set forth Dr. Lambert's qualifications and experience as a physician; his belief that in certain cases, including some subject to his professional advice, the use of spirituous liquor internally as a medicine in an amount exceeding one pint in ten days is necessary for the proper treatment of patients in order to afford relief from human ailments; and that he does not intend to prescribe the use of liquor for beverage purposes. It alleged that to treat the diseases of his patients and to promote their physical well-being, according to the untrammeled exercise of his best skill and scientifically trained judgment, and, to that end to advise the ues of such medicines and medical treatment as in his opinion are best calculated to effect their cure and establish their health. is an essential part of his constitutional rights as a physician.\n In May, 1923, the case was heard upon an application for an interlocutory injunction and a motion to dismiss. The District Court issued the injunction. 291 F.640. \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 589]\n\u00a0\n In December, 1924, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decree, and directed that the bill be dismissed. 4 F.(2d) 915. In the interval, this court had decided Hixon v. Oakes, \n265 \nU.S. 254\n, 44 S. Ct. 514, and Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545\n, 44 S. Ct. 628. In the latter Dr. Lambert's counsel was permitted to file a brief, and to present an oral argument. The appeal in the case at bar was taken under sections 128 and 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120, 1218), and was allowed before the passage of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936. The claim is that the provision assailed is unconstitutional, because it has no real or substantial relation to the appropriate enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, that in enacting the provision Congress exceeded the powers delegated to it by the amendment, and that thereby complainant's fundamental rights are violated.\n The Eighteenth Amendment, besides prohibiting by section 1 the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, confers upon Congress by section 2, in terms, the power to enforce the prohibition by appropriate legislation. That the limitation upon the amount of liquor which may be prescribed for medicinal purposes is a provision adapted to promote the purpose of the amendment is clear. That the provision is not arbitrary appears from the evidence considered by Congress1 which embodies, among other things, the lessons of half a century of experience in the several states in dealing with the liquor problem. \n2\n That evidence dis- \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 590]\n\u00a0\n closed that practicing physicians differ about the value of malt, vinous, and spirituous liquors for medicinal purposes, but that the preponderating opinion is against their use for such purposes, and that among those who prescribe them there are some who are disposed to give prescriptions where the real purpose is to divert the liquor to beverage uses. Indeed, the American Medical Associa- \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 591]\n\u00a0\n tion, at its meeting in 1917, had declared that the use of alcoholic liquor as a thereapeutic agent was without 'scientific basis' and 'should be discouraged,' and, at its meeting in June, 1921, had adopted a resolution saying 'reproach has been brought upon the medical profession by some of its members, who have misused used the law which permits the prescription of alcohol.' With this as the situation to be met, the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives reported with favorable recommendation the bill which became the Act of November 23, 1921, whereby the prescription of intoxicating malt liquor for medicinal purposes is entirely prohibited, and the prescription of other intoxicating liquors is subjected to the following restrictions:\n'No physician shall prescribe nor shall any person sell or furnish on any prescription, any vinous liquor that contains more than 24 per centum of alcohol by volume, nor shall any one prescribe or sell or furnish on any prescription more than one-fourth of one gallon of vinous liquor, or any such vinour or spirituous liquor that contains separately or in the aggregate more than one-half pint of alcohol, for use by any person within any period of ten days. No physician shall be furnished with more than one hundred prescription blanks for use in any period of ninety days, nor shall any physician issue more than that number of prescriptions within any such period unless on application therefor he shall make it clearly apparent to the Commissioner that for some extraordinary reason a larger amount is necessary, whereupon the necessary additional blanks may be furnished him.'\n\n The committee said, in reporting the bill (House Report No. 224, 67th Cong., 1st Sess.):\n'Section 2 prohibits the use of beer as medicine and limits the alcoholic strength and the quantity of wine that may be prescribed. It also provides that no liquor shall be prescribed for use in any period of 10 days that \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 592]\n\u00a0\n contains more alcohol than that heretofore allowed. Under the National Prohibition Act one pint of beverage spirits can be prescribed. With the passage of this bill both spirituous and vinous liquor may be prescribed in one prescription, but the combined content of both liquors must not exceed one-half pint of alcohol. The purpose of this provision is not to increase the alcoholic content of the liquor that may be consumed, but to give physicians a choice between spirituous and vinous liquor within certain specified limits as to quantity.\n\n'This section also writes into the law the present regulation as to the number of prescriptions that may be issued by a physician. One hundred are allowed within a period of 90 days, but this may be exceeded in cases of extraordinary circumstances such as the prevalence of contagious or epidemic diseases. Under ordinary circumstances reputable physicians only write a small fraction of this number, and only about 22 per cent. of the doctors hold permits to prescribe liquor of any kind, although they can be obtained without any fee, simply for the asking. There are a number of states in which the state laws prohibit physicians from prescribing liquor of any kind.'\n\n And also:\n'While the majority of the states prohibit wine for medicinal purposes it was not deemed best by the committee that such provision should be inserted in the prohibition act at this time. In order, however, that this privilege should not be abused, it was deemed best to specifically limit its use, the same as has been done with spirituous liquor. Unless some limit is placed upon the amount of such liquors that may be prescribed, a number of physicians who do not have the high ethical standards of the large majority will abuse the privilege. Evidence was presented to the committee of physicians who issued hundreds of prescriptions within a few days when the \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 593]\n\u00a0\n total number of other prescriptions was a negligible number. In view of the fact that most of the states have more stringent provisions than the one contained in section 2, this legislation will work no hardship upon the profession.'\n\n In Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545\n, 44 S. Ct. 628, the validity of the provision prohibiting the prescription of malt liquor was assailed as going beyond the power of Congress and impinging upon the reserved powers of the states, in that it is an interference with the regulation of health and the practice of medicine both of which are within the domain of state power and outside the legislative power of Congress. The suit was against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and other federal officers, and its chief purpose was to enjoin them from enforcing the provision prohibiting the prescription of malt liquor for medicinal purposes. This court, besides observing that the 'ultimate and controlling question' in the case was whether the provision prohibiting physicians from prescribing intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes is within the power given to Congress by the Eighteenth Amendment, to enforce by 'appropriate legislation' its prohibition of the manufacture, sale, etc., of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes, proceeded to consider every phase of the question, and in conclusion held that the provision was appropriate legislation for the purpose and within the power of Congress, although affecting subjects which, but for the amendment, would be entirely within state control. The court referred to the settled rule that where the means adopted by Congress in exerting an express power are calculated to effect its purpose, it is not admissible for the judiciary to inquire into the degree of their necessity, and then said ( 265 U. S. at page 560, 44 S. Ct. 632):\n'We cannot say that prohibiting traffic in intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes has no real or substantial relation to the enforcement of the Eighteenth \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 594]\n\u00a0\n Amendment, and is not adapted to accomplish that end and make the constitutional prohibition effective. The difficulties always attendant upon the suppression of traffic in intoxicating liquors are notorious. Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 38 S. Ct. 98. The federal government in enforcing prohibition is confronted with difficulties similar to those encountered by the States. Ruppert v. Caffey, supra, \n251 \nU.S. 297\n, 40 S. Ct. 141 (64 L. Ed. 260). The opportunity to manufacture, sell, and prescribe intoxicating malt liquors for 'medicinal purposes' opens many doors to clandestine traffic in them as beverages under the guise of medicines, facilitates many frauds, subterfuges and artifices; aids evasion, and thereby and to that extent hampers and obstructs the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment.'\n\n The court further held that Congress must be regarded as having concluded-as it well might do in the absence of any consensus of opinion among physicians and in the presence of the absolute prohibition in many of the states-that malt liquor has no substantial medicinal qualities making its prescription necessary, and that this made it impossible to say the provision was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of power.\n We have spoken of that case at length because the decision was by a unanimous court and if adhered to disposes of the present case. If Congress may prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating malt liquor for medicinal purposes by way of enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment, it equally and to the same end may restrict the prescription of other intoxicating liquor for medicinal purposes. In point of power there is no difference; if in point of expediency there is a difference, that is a matter which Congress alone may consider. Experience has shown that opportunities for doing what the Constitution forbids are present in both instances, and that advantage not infrequently is taken of these opportunities. Congress, in deference to the belief of a fraction of the medical profession that vinous and spirituous liquors have \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 595]\n\u00a0\n some medicinal value, has said that they may be prescribed in limited quantities according to stated regulations; but it also has said that they shall not be prescribed in larger quantities, nor without conforming to the regulations, because this would be attended with too much risk of the diversion of the liquor to beverage uses. Not only so, but the limitation as to quantity must be taken as embodying an implicit congressional finding that such liquors have no such medicinal value as gives rise to a need for larger or more frequent prescriptions. Such a finding, in the presence of the wellknown diverging opinions of physicians, cannot be regarded as arbitrary or without a reasonable basis. On the whole, therefore, we think it plain that the restrictions imposed are admissible measures for enforcing the prohibition ordained by the Eighteenth Amendment.\n A later case applying like principles is Selzman v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 466\n, 45 S. Ct. 574. There a section of the National Prohibition Act forbidding the sale of denatured alcohol without a compliance with certain regulations was assailed as beyond the authority of Congress under the Eighteenth Amendment upon the ground that the amendment relates only to traffic in intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes, and that, as denatured alcohol is not usable as a beverage, authority to prevent or regulate its sale is not given to Congress by the amendment, but remains exclusively in the states. This court held the section valid for the following reasons:\n'The power of the federal government, granted by the Eighteenth Amendment, to enforce the prohibition of the manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxicating liquor carries with it power to enact any ligislative measures reasonably adapted to promote the purpose. The denaturing in order to render the making and sale of industrial alcohol compatible with the enforcement of prohibition of alcohol for beverage purposes is not always \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 596]\n\u00a0\n effective. The ignorance of some, the craving and the hardihood of others, and the fraud and cupidity of still others, often tend to defeat its object. It helps the main purpose of the amendment, therefore, to hedge about the making and disposition of the denatured article every reasonable precaution and penalty to prevent the proper industrial use of it from being perverted to drinking it.'\n\n From the authority of these cases Dr. Lambert seeks to escape by pointing out that he is a physician and believes that the use of spirituous liquor as a medicinal agent is at times both advisable and necessary. He asserts that to control the medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government. Of course his belief in the medicinal value of such liquor is not of controlling significance; it merely places him in what was shown to Congress to be the minor fraction of his profession. Besides, there is no right to practice medicine which is not subordinate to the police power of the states (Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n, 9 S. Ct. 231; Collins v. Texas, \n223 \nU.S. 288\n, 32 S. Ct. 286; Crane v. Johnson, \n242 \nU.S. 339\n, 37 S. Ct. 176, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 796; Graves v. Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 425\n, 47 S. Ct. 122, 71 L. Ed. -, No. 320 of this term, decided November 22), and also to the power of Congress to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the Eighteenth Amendment. When the United States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exercise may be attended by some or all of the incidents which attend the exercise by a state of its police power. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 40 S. Ct. 106; Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 300\n, 40 S. Ct. 141. The Eighteenth Amendment confers upon the federal government the power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. Under it, as under the necessary and proper clause of article 1,  8, of the Constitution, Congress has power to enforce prohibition 'by \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 597]\n\u00a0\n appropriate legislation.' High medical authority being in conflict as to the medicinal value of spirituous and vinous liquors taken as a beverage, it would, indeed, be strange if Congress lacked the power to determine that the necessities of the liquor problem require a limitation of permissible prescriptions, as by keeping the quantity that may be prescribed within limits which will minimize the temptation to resort to prescriptions as pretexts for obtaining liquor for beverage uses. Compare Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11\n, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n The general design of the federal Constitution is to give to the federal government control over national and international matters, leaving to the several states the control of local affairs. Prior to the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment, accordingly, the direct control of the manufacture, sale and use of intoxicating liquors for all purposes was exclusively under the police powers of the states; and there it still remains, save in so far as it has been taken away by the words of the amendment. These words are perfectly plain and cannot be extended beyond their import without violating the fundamental rule that the government of the United States is one of delegated powers only and that 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states' respectively, or to the people. Const. Amend. 10. The pertinent words of the amendment are:\n'... The manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors ... for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.'\n\n Plainly, Congress in submitting the amendment, and the several states in ratifying it, meant to leave the question of the prohibition of intoxicating liquors for other than beverage purposes to the determination of the states, where it had always been. The limiting words of the amendment are not sus- \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 598]\n\u00a0\n ceptible of any other meaning, and to extend them beyond the scope of that meaning really is to substitute words of another and different import.\n It is important also to bear in mind that:\n'Direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government.' Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 18\n, 45 S. Ct. 446, 449 (69 L. Ed. 819, 39 A. L. R. 229).\n\n Congress, therefore, cannot directly restrict the professional judgment of the physician or interfere with its free exercise in the treatment of disease. Whatever power exists in that respect belongs to the states exclusively.\n The sole question which we are called upon to consider is whether the District Court erred in denying the motion of the defendants to dismiss plaintiff's bill; and upon that question, of course, we are bound to accept as true all allegations of the bill which are well pleaded.\n The suit was brought by a physician of distinction and, as the court below said, 'of wide and unusual experience in the practice of medicine.' He alleges that it is his opinion, based on experience, observation and medical study, that the use of spirituous liquors as medicine is, in certain case, necessary in order to afford relief from known ailments; and that in the use of such liquors as medicine it is, in certain cases, including some now under his own observation and subject to his professional advice, necessary, in order to afford relief, that more than one pint of such liquor in ten days should be used internally and, in certain cases, necessary that it should be used without delay, notwithstanding that within a preceding period of less than 10 days one pint of such liquor has already been used. He further alleges that in prescribing drugs and medicines the determination of the quantity involves a consideration of the physical condition of the patient and their probable effect in each specific case.\n In addition to these allegations, we have the fact that Congress, acting upon a report of one of its committees \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 599]\n\u00a0\n made after exhaustive hearings, declared by statute that the prescription of malt liquors should be prohibited and the prescription of spirituous and vinous liquors should be permitted. Justifying such legislation, the committee had reported that the overwhelming evidence was to the effect that malt liquors (not also spirituous and vinous liquors) had no substantial medicinal value. It is now said by the majority, at one point, that the preponderating opinion of practicing physicians is agaiinst the use of all three and, at another point, that only a minor fraction hold the other view. I am quite unable to assent to these generalizations. On the contrary, the impossibility of determining, from anything now before this court, what is the preponderating opinion upon the subject, is very clear. An examination of the hearings before the House Judiciary Committee, cited as authority for the foregoing statements, shows that the inquiry there was directed to the question of the medical value of malt liquors and that the question of the medical value of the other liquors was not under consideration. The hearings contain a few casual references to the other liquors; but I feel justified in saying that they reflect no light upon the state of medical opinion as to the value of such liquors as medicines. It is stated in the brief for the appellees that a questionnaire, sent out to one-third of the physicians of the United States, brought a reply from enough to make 21.5 per cent. of the whole number of physicians in the country, and that a little more than one-half of those replying voted 'Yes' on the use of whisky as a therapeutic agency, some of them, however, taking exception to the word 'necessary,' saying that no drugs were absolutely necessary. The American Medical Association, whose resolution of 1917 is referred to, have filed in this case a brief as amicus curiae, challenging the conclusion which is drawn from that resolution and vigor- \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 600]\n\u00a0\n ously attacking the act now under review as arbitrary and unreasonable. In 1924 the house of delegates of the association adopted a resolution expressing its disapproval of those portions of the act 'which interfere with the proper relation between the physician and his patient in prescribing alcohol medicinally.' It seems plain, therefore, that the most that can be said is that the question is of a highly controversial character; and, since it reasonably cannot be doubted that it is a fairly debatable one, the legislative finding, necessarily implicit in the act, that vinous and spirituous liquors are of medicinal value, must be accepted here. Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S. Ct. 325; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis, \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Price v. Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446, 452\n, 35 S. Ct. 892\n\n\n The majority opinion rests chiefly upon Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545\n, 44 S. Ct. 628, which, it is said, was decided by a unanimous court and, if adhered to, disposes of the present case. While, of course, in the light of the present ruling, I cannot say that, if the court had entertained that view of the scope of its decision at the time of its rendition, it would not have been rendered; I do say it is very certain that it would not have been by a unanimous court. In the opinion in that case there is some general discussion of the power to Congress in respect of the adoption of appropriate means to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, but the decision rests upon the ground that Congress, upon conflicting evidence, had determined that malt liquors possessed no substantial medicinal value and judicial inquiry upon that question was, therefore, foreclosed. In direct response to the contention that the act was an 'arbitrary and unreasonable prohibition of the use of valuable medicinal agents,' it was said (265 U. S. at pages 561, 562, 44 S. Ct. 632):\n'When the bill was pending in Congress the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives held an extended public hearing in which it received testimony, \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 601]\n\u00a0\n among other things, on the question whether beer and other intoxicating malt liquors possessed any substantial medicinal properties. Hearings before House Judiciary Committee on H. R. 5033, Serial 2, May 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 1921. On the information thus received the committee recommended the passage of the bill. H. R. 67th Cong., 1st Sess., Rep. No. 224. And in the light of all the testimony Congress determined, in effect, that intoxicating malt liquors possessed no substantial and essential medicinal properties which made it necessary that their use for medicinal purposes should be permitted, and that, as a matter affecting the public health, it was sufficient to permit physicians to prescribe spirituous and vinous intoxicating liquors in addition to the nonintoxicating malt liquors whose manufacture and sale is permitted under the National Prohibition Act.'\n\n And finally (265 U. S. at page 563, 44 S. Ct. 633):\n'We find, on the whole, no ground for disturbing the determination of Congress on the question of fact as to the reasonable necessity, in the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, of prohibiting prescriptions of intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes. See Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292\n, 44 S. Ct. 325.'\n\n And so here, the legislative finding, implicit in the statute now under review, to the contrary effect, in respect of spirituous and vinous liquors, likewise should be accepted as controlling, and the Everard's Breweries Case rejected as inapplicable.\n As the record now stands, therefore, we must begin this inquiry with the assumption that vinous and spirituous liquors are in fact valuable medicines; and it necessarily follows that, at least as an end as distinguished from a means to an end, the prescription of such liquors in good faith for medicinal use cannot be prohibited by Congress, since that body lawfully cannot legislate beyond the grants of the Constitution. The report of the committee \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 602]\n\u00a0\n and the hearings will be searched in vain to find any suggestion that the quantity designated by the statute is adequate or that the committee or Congress gave any consideration to that question. The only fact in this record bearing upon that subject is the allegation, under oath, of appellant that in his professional opinion, based on experience, observation and medical study, more than that quantity, in certain cases, including some under his own observation and advice, is necessary. And, certainly, there is no basis for asserting the contrary in any fact or circumstance to be found outside the record of which this court can take judicial notice.\n The naked question, then, simply comes to this: Conceding these liquors to be valuable medicines, has Congress power, under the constitutional provision prohibiting traffic in intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, to limit their prescription in good faith, and consequently their necessary use, for medicinal purposes, to a quantity which, under the allegations taken as true, is inadequate for such purposes? To me the answer seems plain. If Congress cannot altogether prohibit the prescription for medicinal use, it cannot limit the prescription to an inadequate quantity, for, obviously, in that case, to the extent of the inadequacy, the prohibition is as complete, and the usurpation of power as clear, as though the prohibition were unqualified. If the power exists to limit the quantity to a pint in 10 days, it exists to limit the quantity to a tablespoonful or a teaspoonful or a few drops during the same or any other arbitrary period of time, with the result in substance and effect that the definite limitation of the prohibitory power by the words 'for beverage purposes' vanishes altogether.\n It is said that high medical authority is in conflict as to the medicinal value of spirituous and vinous liquors and hence it would be strange if Congress lacked power to determine that the necessities of the liquor problem re- \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 603]\n\u00a0\n quire a reasonable limitation of the permissible prescriptions. This observation does more than beg the question; it indulges an assumption the exact contrary of that which the record conclusively establishes, for the limitation of quantity is not only unsupported by any legislative finding that it is reasonable, but it is in flat opposition to the only facts appearing in the record which bear upon the question of what is a permissible prescription, and therefore is without rational basis, resting alone upon the arbitrarily exercised will of Congress. I do not see how it can be held otherwise without completely ignoring the case as made and constructing and considering another and different case.\n Nor is the opinion of the majority aided by the long list of state enactments cited to demonstrate that the present statute is not arbitrary, for, since the control of the medical practice is outside the province of the federal government and wholly within that of the states (Linder v. United States, supra), the powers of Congress in that field are not to be assimilated to those of the states.\n By the legislation now under review, the authority of Congress is so exercised that the reserved power of the states to control the practice of medicine is directly invaded, to the illegitimate end that the prescription and use of liquors for medicinal purposes is prohibited. It is true that Congress has wide discretion in the choice of means to carry the granted power into effect; but the means not only must be appropriate to the end but must be such as 'are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. A grant of power to prohibit for specified purposes does not include the power to prohibit for other and different purposes. Congressional legislation directly prohibiting intoxicating liquor for concededly medical purposes, therefore, does not consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, and viewed as a \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 604]\n\u00a0\n means of carrying into effect the granted power is in fraud of that instrument, and especially of the Tenth Amendment. The words of Mr. Madison (Writings of James Madison, vol. 6, p. 367) are pertinent:\n'Nor can it ever be granted that a power to act on a case when it actually occurs, includes a power over all the means that may tend to prevent the occurrence of the case. Such a latitude of construction would render unavailing every practical definition of particular and limited powers.'\n\n The effect of upholding the legislation is to deprive the states of the exclusive power, which the Eighteenth Amendment has not destroyed, of controlling medical practice and transfer it in part of Congress. See Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251, 275\n, 276 S., 38 S. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724. It goes further, for, it Congress can prohibit the prescription of liquor for necessary medical purposes as a means of preventing the furnishing of it for beverage purposes, that body, by a parity of reasoning, may prohibit the manufacture and sale for industrial or sacramental purposes, or, indeed, as the most effective possible means of preventing the traffic in it for beverage purposes, may prohibit such manufacture and sale altogether, with the result that, under the pretense of adopting appropriate means, a carefully and definitely limited power will have been expanded into a general and unlimited power. 'The purposes intended must be attained consistently with constitutional limitations and not by an invasion of the powers of the states. This court has no more important function than that which devolves upon it the obligation to preserve inviolate the constitutional limitations upon the exercise of authority, federal and state, to the end that each may continue to discharge, harmoniously with the other, the duties intrusted to it by the Constitution.' Hammer v. Dagenhart, supra, at page 276 (38 S. Ct. 533),\n I do not doubt the authority of Congress to regulate the disposal of intoxicating \n\n[272 U.S. 581, 605]\n\u00a0\n liquors for medicinal use so as to prevent evasions of the law against the traffic in such liquors for beverage purposes, and to that end to surround the prescription by the physician with every appropriate safeguard against fraud and imposition; but as this record now stands it cannot prohibit the legitimate prescription of spirituous and vinous liquors for medicine as this statute attempts to do. 'Federal power is delegated, and its prescribed limits must not be transcended even though the end seen desirable.' Linder v. United States, supra, at page 22 (45 S. Ct. 450). Because this statute by fixing inadequate prescriptions prohibits to the extent of such inadequacies the legitimate prescription of spirituous and vinous liquors for medicinal purposes, it exceeds the powers of Congress, invades those exclusively reserved to the states, and is not appropriate legislation to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment. The decree below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See House Report No. 224, 67th Cong., lst Sess., Ser.

While this permit was in force O'Kane violated the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4, et seq.) and the regulations by selling whisky to a pharmacy having no permit to purchase it, and failing to keep a record of the sales as required by the regulations. He was assessed with a differential tax of $1,098.72. He paid this, under protest, to Lederer, the Collector of Internal Revenue. and thereafter brought suit against Lederer in a Federal District Court to recover the amount paid. Lederer, while conceding this claim, interposed a counterclaim for $2,000 on the surety bond, the full amount of which, he insisted, had become due to the United States by reason of the breach of condition. The District Court, holding that 'the amount named in the bond represents a limit, and not a measure, of liability,' denied the counterclaim, and gave O'Kane judgment for the amount of the tax paid. O'Kane v. Lederer, 4 F.(2d) 418. And the case having been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals on a writ of error, it has certified to us, in effect, the questions whether a surety bond executed on Form 738-after Form 1408 had been prescribed-is a forfeiture bond entitling the United States to recover the full amount named on a breach of its condition, or an indemnity bond merely.\n In the brief filed in this Court in behalf of Lederer, it is now said that the decision in Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S. Ct. 415, 'makes it plain that, in defending an action for the recovery of taxes alleged to have been illegally collected, a collector of internal revenue is not acting for and in behalf of the United States, but is seeking to prevent the entry of a personal judgment against himself,' and that it 'would apparently follow that the collector is without right in such a case to set up as a counterclaim \n\n[271 U.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n an alleged indebtedness of the plaintiff to the United States.' And it is suggested that, 'as the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals without regard to the points presented in the certified questions,' an answer to these questions, which would avail nothing, is not required. United States v. Buzzo, 18 Wall. 125, 129; United States v. Britton, \n108 \nU.S. 199, 207\n, 2 S.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 251\nArgued: April 19, 1926Decided: May 10, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Christopher B. Garnett, of Washington, D. C., for appellants. \n\n[271 U.S. 204, 205]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the trustees of the Levi Z. Leiter estate, under the Tucker Act,1 to recover rentals under four leases to the United States. The petition was dismissed, on demurrer, for failure to state a cause of action. 59 Ct. Cl. 907. The appeal was taken in January, 1925\n\n\n The leases which were for space in an office building, were made by the trustees and the Treasury Department, in 1920 and 1921, for terms of four and five years, for the use of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance and other Federal agencies that were subsequently merged, in August, 1921, in the Veterans' Bureau. \n2\n The leases provided for stipulated annual rentals, to be paid in monthly installments. At the time they were made, however, there were no appropriations available for the payment of the rent after the first fiscal year during the term of each lease; and each provided that the term of occupancy should extend to June 30, 1925, 'contingent upon' the making available by Congress of appropriations out of which the rent might be paid after the current fiscal year; and that if such appropriation was not made for any fiscal year, the lease should terminate as of June 30 of the year for which an appropriation was last available.\n On May 29, 1922-before any appropriation had been made out of which the rent could be paid for the next fiscal year-the Director of the Veterans' Bureau gave written notice to the trustees that the premises described in the leases would be 'vacated, relinquished and returned' to them on June 30. On June 1 the trustees wrote to the bureau denying the right of the Government to terminate the leases, and stating that the surrender \n\n[271 U.S. 204, 206]\n\u00a0\n would not be accepted and claim would be made against the Government for their full period, whether the premises were occupied or not. By an Act of June 12, 1922,3 a lump sum appropriation was made for the expenses of the Bureau, including rentals, for the next fiscal year, commencing July 1. On June 30, however, the Bureau vacated the premises in accordance with its previous notice. All rentals due to and including that date were duly paid. Thereafter, the trustees, being unable to re-lease the premises, presented to the Bureau bills for the rentals for July and succeeding months, the payment of which was refused; and these claims were also disallowed by the Comptroller General. The trustees thereafter instituted the present action to recover the rent claimed to be due from July 1, 1922 to June 30, 1923, inclusive.\n We are of opinion that the demurrer to the petition was rightly sustained.\n Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6884) provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that:\n'No contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made, unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment. ...'\n\n And section 3679 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of February 27, 1906, c. 510,4  3, provides that:\n'No. Executive Department or other Government establishment of the United States shall expend, in any one fiscal year, any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in any contract or other obligation for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.'\n\n It is not alleged or claimed that these loases were made under any specific authority of law. And since at the \n\n[271 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n time they were made there was no appropriation available for the payment or rent after the first fiscal year, it is clear that in so far as their terms extended beyond that year they were in violation of the express provisions of the Revised Statutes; and, being to that extent executed without authority of law, they created no binding obligation against the United States after the first year. See Chase v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 489, 502\n, 503 S., 15 S. Ct. 174, Sutton v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 575, 579\n, 41 S. Ct. 563, 19 A. L. R. 403, United States v. Doullut, 213 F. 729, 737, 130 C. C. A. 243, and Abbott v. United States (C. C.) 66 F. 447, 448. A lease to the Government for a term of years when entered into under an appropriation available for but one fiscal year, is binding on the Government only for that year. McCollum v. United States, 17 Ct. Cl. 92, 104; Smoot v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 418, 427. And it is plain that to make it binding for any subsequent year, it is necessary, not only that on appropriation be made available for the payment of the rent, but that the Government, by its duly authorized officers, affirmatively continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in effect, by the adoption of the original lease, making a new lease under the authority of such appropriation for the subsequent year. This conclusion is in entire accord with Bradley v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 104, 114\n, 115 S.. There, a building having been leased to the Post Office Department for three years at a stipulated annual rental of $4, 200, subject to an appropriation by Congress for payment of the rental, and Congress, before the expiration of the second of $1,800 only for a specific appropriation of $1,800 only for the payment of rent for the third year, and the Department having continued to occupy the building for the third year, it was held the lessor could recover only the amount thus specifically appropriated for the occupancy of the building during the third year, and not the full amount of the rent stipulated in the lease.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n In the present case, in accordance with the notice of the Veterans' Bureau that it would surrender the premises on June 30, 1922, the Government did not occupy the premises after that date. That is, although a lump sum appropriation had meanwhile been made for the rental expenses of the Veterans' Bureau for the next fiscal year-in which no reference was made to these specific leases-the leases were not continued under this appropriation for the next year, either by a specific agreement to that effect or by the occupation of the premises. So, the Government did not become liable for the payment of rent after the surrender of the premises.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24 Stat. 505, c. 359; Judicial Code,  145 (Comp.

Kunkel, and George Ross Hull, all of Harrisburg, Pa., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur H. Hull, of Harrisburg, Pa., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Pennsylvania (Pa. St. 1920, s 21916 et seq.). It is for the death of the claimants' son in the employment of the defendants, without negligence or fault on the part of the latter, so far as appears. The son died unmarried and without issue, and the claimants, the plaintiffs in error, were wholly dependent upon him for support; but they were Italians living in Italy. The Compensation Board in obedience to a decision of the Court of Common Pleas awarded $820, and the award was affirmed by that Court. The judgment was reversed by the Superior Court on the ground that the statute expressly provided that 'alien ... parents ... not residents of the United States, shall not be entitled to any compensation,' section 310 (Pa. St. 1920, s 22007), and that the Treaty of 1913 with Italy did not cover the case. 81 Pa. Super. Ct. 403. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court on the opinion below. 126 A. 257, 281 Pa. 227. As the plaintiffs contended that the Treaty with Italy invalidated the above clause of the State law and gave them a right to recover, a writ of error was allowed.\n Article 3 of the treaty as amended reads:\n'The citizens of each of the High Contracting Parties shall receive in the States and Territories of the other the most constant security and protection for their persons and property and for their rights, including that form of protection granted by any State or national law which establishes a civil responsibility for injuries or for death caused by negligence or fault and gives to relatives or heirs of the injured party a right of action, which right shall not be restricted on account of the nationality of said relatives or heirs; and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privi- \n\n[270 U.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n leges as are or shall be granted to nationals, provided that they submit themselves to the conditions imposed on the latter.' 38 Stat. 1669, 1670\n\n\n\n This amendment was suggested by the decision in Maiorano v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 29 S. Ct. 424, \n213 U.S. 268\n, that under the laws of Pennsylvania a non-resident alien widow could not recover for the death of her husband caused by the defendant's negligence, although citizens of the State were given a remedy. Following this suggestion, the words of the amendment, if taken literally, deal only with death caused by negligence or fault. It is natural that they should be limited in that way. Apart from those States, of which Pennsylvania is not one, that very recently have substituted for the common law a general system of quasi insurance liability without fault is exceptional and usually has not been imposed for death except as the result of a voluntary arrangement. The statutes of Pennsylvania accord with this view of the Treaty. They give to alien nonresident dependent parents the same right to recover damages for death due to fault that they give to citizens and residents. Then the Compensation Act offers a plan different from the common law and the workman is free not to come in under it. If he does, of course all benefits dependent on the new arrangement are matters of agreement and statutory consequences of agreement and cannot be carried further than the contract and statute go. One of those benefits is compensation irrespective of the cause of death, but it is confined to residents. Whether the workman's election to take advantage of the statute could be made a bar to a suit by his parents alleging a wrong is not before us here, but the right to recover without alleging fault depends on the terms of the Act.\n We are of opinion that the Treaty was construed rightly by the Courts below. Were it otherwise, and if the excluding clause of the Compensation Act were held void, the question would arise whether the general grant to \n\n[270 U.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n parents in the plaintiffs' situation could be extended to cover those whom it excluded in terms or whether, notwithstanding a saving clause, section 502 (Pa. St. 1920, s 22110), the whole grant would fail on the ground that it could not be maintained as made and could not be assumed to go farther. But treaties are not likely to intermeddle with the consequences of voluntary arrangements, if the right is given, as here it was given by other statutes, to sue for death wrongfully caused, at least unless those arrangements made by third persons take away that right. It looks somewhat as if in the first stages of this case that right was supposed to be taken away; but, if so, the question was not saved, and the only question before us is whether the plaintiffs can recover under the Compensation Act, not whether they could recover for a wrongful death, which was not proved or even alleged.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIVE OAK WATER USERS' ASS'N v. RAILROAD COMMISSION OF STATE OF(1926)\nNo. 73\nArgued: October 22, 1925Decided: January 4, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. S. Brittain, of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Carl I. Wheat, of San Francisco, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Sutter-Butte Canal Company, a public service corporation of California, has long supplied water for irrigation in the Sacramento Valley. Before 1913 petitioners or their predecessors severally contracted with it for water to be used during long terms, on definitely described parcels of land, at prices based upon their total areas, at specified rates per acre, whether actually consumed or not. Payment of the stipulated sums was secured by liens on the entire tracts; rights so acquired were appurtenant to the land, and constituted a servitude upon the water. Other stipulations concerned lateral ditches, \n\n[269 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n etc. Those who held these agreements are referred to as contract customers. Other parties-noncontract customers-were supplied and charged according to number of acres actually irrigated from year to year.\n In 1918 the Railroad Commission permitted a general increase of rates, but gave contract customers somewhat lower ones than those prescribed for others. Thereafter the company continued to demand and receive from all contract customers yearly sums, reckoned according to entire acreage.\n April 26, 1922, the Commission granted another increase of rates, again giving lower ones to contract customers. Plaintiffs in error obtained from the court below a review of this order. Their petition therefor asked:\n'That upon such review such order and decision of said Railroad Commission be annulled and set aside, in so far as the same makes provision for the collection of rates upon any acreage other than that upon which water may be desired by these petitioners.'\n\n That court first held the challenged order produced unlawful inequalities between contract and noncontract customers, contrary to the law of the state, and therefore should be set aside. 65 Cal. Dec. 69. Having granted a rehearing, it declared the inequalities were not unreasonable, and affirmed the order. 192 Cal. 132, 219 P. 65.\n The cause is here upon writ of error. Considering the circumstances disclosed by the record, we have no jurisdiction, unless it affirmatively appears that in the court below there was duly drawn in question the validity of a statute of or an authority exercised under the state, because or repugnance to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Judicial Code,  237, as amended September 6, 1916 (Comp. St.  1214). Under repeated rulings here, for jurisdictional purposes the order of the Commission must be treated as though an act of the Legislature. Lake Erie & West. R. R. Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission ex rel. Cameron, \n249 \nU.S. 422, 424\n, 39 S. Ct. 345, and cases there cited.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n The brief for plaintiffs in error declares:\n'The plaintiffs in error maintain that by the judgment of the Supreme Court of California the obligations of their contracts have been impaired, that their property has been taken without due process of law, that they have been denied the equal protection of the laws, and that the California court has denied and renounced its power to protect the plaintiffs in error in their claims of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n This statement shows no jurisdiction here under the writ of error, although it specifies a federal question justiciable by certiorari. Something more than a claim of federal right is necessary; the attack must be upon the validity of the order, not merely upon the court's judgment.\n The brief further states that by the application to the Railroad Commission for rehearing, and in the petition to the Supreme Court of California for review, plaintiffs in error set up their federal claims. No citations to the record accompany this statement, as our rules require. Rule 25, 2(c). A claim merely presented to the Commission upon application for rehearing would not suffice to give us jurisdiction. It must have been definitely brought to the court's attention. Although a copy of the request for rehearing addressed to the Commission is annexed to the petition to the Supreme Court, this petition made no claim under the federal Constitution with sufficient definiteness for us to say that the court's attention was challenged thereto. Neither opinion of the court shows that it considered or necessarily passed upon any such question. After the second opinion a petition for rehearing dwelt much on federal rights, but this was denied, without more, and is now without consequence. Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n261 \nU.S. 114, 117\n, 43 S.

Baldwin, \n166 \nU.S. 485, 488\n, 17 S. Ct. 639, 640 (41 L. Ed. 1087), here upon error to the Supreme Court of California, this court said:\n'The contention that there was a federal question raised below finds its only support in the fact that there has been printed in the record, as filed in this court, what purports to be an extract from the closing brief of counsel presented to the Supreme Court of the state, in which such a federal question is discussed, and it is asserted orally at bar that in the oral arrgument made in the Supreme Court of California a claim under the federal Constitution was presented. But manifestly the matters \n\n[269 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n referred to form no part of the record, and are not adequate to create a federal question, when no such question was necessarily decided below, and the record does not disclose that such issues was set up or claimed in any proper manner in the courts of the state.'\n\n As we interpret its opinion and judgment, the court below ruled only that the order of the Commission fixed rated to be charged, leaving all other questions subject to determination by the courts. Counsel for the Commission affirmed this interpretation, and at the bar agreed that judgment here might rest thereon. In printed argument he said:\n'Except as to rates, the Commission did not attempt (in fact, expressly disclaimed any attempt) to change any of the provisions of these contracts, and the effect of this rate order, as a matter of law, on those other provisions was left by the Commission for determination by the courts as the occasion might arise.'\n\n The decision below upon this point of local law is enough to support the judgment, and leaves no federal question open for our determination.\n In cases where the state court has decided a local question adequate to support its judgment, this court has sometimes affirmed, and sometimes has dismissed, the writ of error.

JAMES(1926)\n\nArgued: Decided: October 25, 1926\n\n\n Denied Jan. 3, 1927. \n\n[272 U.S. 701, 702]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ford W. Harris, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Wm. J. Hughes, Jr., of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion for leave to file a petition for mandamus by the Los Angeles Brush Manufacturing Corporation, against a Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The petitioner is a defendant in two patent suits pending in that court, in one of which the Stabler Parker Company is complainant, and W. B. Clancy and others are complainants in the other. The suits are bills in equity brought to restrain the defendant from infringement of a patent for a new and improved brush. The defendant answered and the complainants moved to set the two cases for trial. Counsel for the complainants said that while his clients would prefer to try the case before the court, he would ask, if the court had not time to try them, that the cases be referred to a special master. Counsel for the defendant objected to such a reference, and said that if the reference was to be made, he would like to have a notation in the record that no showing had been made of exceptional circumstances, and that the cases were referred to the master over his objection. Thereupon the following order was made in each case:\n\n\n[272 U.S. 701, 703]\n\u00a0\n 'This cause now appearing on the call of the court's calendar to be set for trial, and it being the desire of both counsel for the plaintiff and defendant, as expressed in open court, that a date be fixed for the trial hereof, and counsel for the plaintiff insists that, because of alleged acts of infringement committed by the defendant, plaintiff will suffer damage by reason of the great delay in the hearing and determination of the issues herein; and it appearing that because of the congestion of the court's calendar there are many other causes entitled to be first heard, including a large number of criminal causes which are entitled to preference over civil matters as to the trial thereof; and it further appearing that, because of the protracted length of patent trials, the result has been and is that other civil litigants having causes to be tried have not been accorded a fair proportion of the time of the court; and it appearing that this condition will continue unless many of the patent cases, including this cause, now pending can be disposed of in the manner herein provided, and, hence, that in order to fairly and within a reasonable time dispose of the business before the court, it is necessary that this order be made:\n'It is now ordered, that this cause be referred to Charles C. Montgomery, Esq., standing master in chancery, to take and hear the evidence offered by the respective parties and to make his conclusions as to the facts in issue and recommend the judgment to be entered thereon; the standing master in chancery is authorized and empowered to do all things and to make such orders as may be required to accomplish a full hearing on all matters of fact and law in issue in this cause; the objection of counsel for the defendant to the making of this order referring the cause to the master is hereby noted and an exception is allowed in favor of the defendant.'\n\n Thereupon the defendant filed this petition asking a rule against the judge to show cause why a mandamus may \n\n[272 U.S. 701, 704]\n\u00a0\n not issue directing him to vacate the order of reference to the master and to place the causes on the calendar for trial in open court. He says that he is informed and believes that at some time prior to July 12, 1926, the judges of the United States District Court, Southern District of California, by mutual agreement, appointed Montgomery as standing master to try patent causes; that at the calling of the term calendar in July, 1926, and at divers times since, all the District Judges have announced in open court and in chambers that they would not personally try all causes involving patents for invention, but would refer substantially all such causes to said standing master; that the result is that the standing master has set up a court with an extensive docket; that the causes here in question are ordinary and extremely simple patent causes which can be quickly and expeditiously tried, as will appear from the records therein; that the principal reasons given for the action by the court is that patent causes sometimes require protracted trials, and that the court calendar is now, and has been for some years, rather congested, but that this condition is not exceptional, but quite usual in most of the District Courts, and promises to continue indefinitely. The petitioner avers that it has an established right under the equity rules to a trial in open court; that the petitioner has no other remedy than application to this court to act under the supervisory authority established by section 234 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1211), 1 Stat. at Large 80, and in accordance with Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n; that unless this application is granted, the litigants in patent causes in the Southern District of California will be forced at their own expense to maintain a patent court set up by the judges of the District Court and operating in defiance of the plain intent of the equity rules; that by thus singling out patent cases such judges have unjustly and arbitrarily discriminated against a certain class of litigants and sub- \n\n[272 U.S. 701, 705]\n\u00a0\n jected those litigants to unnecessary trouble and expense, because proceedings before a master are invariably protracted and expensive, and the cost of such proceedings must be borne by the litigants.\n By section 917 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1543), this court is given power from time to time in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the United States, to regulate the whole practice to be used in suits in equity or admiralty by the District Courts. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1. This was taken from section 13 of the original Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 80, c. 20. The same thirteenth section provided that the Supreme Court should have appellate jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law to any courts appointed under the authority of the United States. This part of the original section 13 became embodied in section 688 of the Revised Statutes and is now to be found in section 234 of the Judicial Code.\n In Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n, at page 323, Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for the court in reference to writs of mandamus which the Supreme Court might issue, said:\n ,'in what case such a writ is warranted by the principles and usages of law it is not always easy to determine. Its use has been very much extended in modern times, and now it may be said to be an established remedy to oblige inferior courts and magistrates to do that justice which they are in duty, and by virtue of their office, bound to do. It does not lie to control judicial discretion, except when that discretion has been abused; but it is a remedy when the case is outside of the exercise of this discretion, and outside the jurisdiction of the court or officer to which or to whom the writ is addressed.'\n The hearing of these causes in review would normally be had in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, and they could only come here in due course by applications for certiorari and the granting of them. We do not need to decide whether the intervention between \n\n[272 U.S. 701, 706]\n\u00a0\n this court and the District Court of an intermediate appellate court would prevent the issue of mandamus by this court direct to the District Court in matters in which the Circuit Court of Appeals would or should ordinarily have power to issue a mandamus to the same end in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. However that may be, we think it clear that, where the subject concerns the enforcement of the equity rules which by law it is the duty of this court to formulate and put in force, and in a case in which this court has the ultimate discretion to review the case on its merits, it may use its power of mandamus and deal directly with the District Court in requiring it to conform to them. Ex parte Abdu, 247 U. S, 27, 28, 38 S. Ct. 447; Ex parte Crane, 5 Pet. 190, 192, 193, 194. This is not to say that, in every case where the equity rules are the subject of interpretation and enforcement in the District Court, such questions may as of course be brought here and considered in a direct proceeding in mandamus. The question of thus using the writ of mandamus would be a matter of discretion in this court, and it would decline to exercise its power where the issue might more properly come up by mandamus in an intermediate appellate court or in regular proceedings on review. If it clearly appeared, however, that a practice had been adopted by District Judges as to the order or procedure in hearing causes at variance with the equity rules, our writ might well issue directly to such judges.\n Rule 46 requires that in any trials in equity the testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open court, except as otherwise provided by statute or the rules, and that the court shall pass upon the admissibility of all evidence offered as in actions at law. Equity rule 59 provides that save in matters of account, a reference to a master shall be the exception, not the rule, and shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it. These rules were adopted by this court \n\n[272 U.S. 701, 707]\n\u00a0\n after a thorough revision. Committees of the bar from the nine different circuits were invited to assist the court in the matter. The court, after much consideration, concluded that the then method of taking evidence in patent and other causes in equity had been productive of unnecessary expense and burden to the litigants and caused much delay in their disposition, and that the effective way to avoid the making of extended records, unnecessary to a consideration of the real issues of the causes, was to require, so far as it might be possible and practicable, that the evidence taken in patent and other cases should be taken in open court, and that in only exceptional cases should be cause be referred after issue to a special master. Though there has been some criticism and complaint of the inconveniences that arise from this change of the rules, the court is strongly convinced that the change has justified itself and has no purpose to amend the provisions of rule 46 and rule 59. Were it to find that the rules have been practically nullified by a District Judge or by a concert of action on the part of several District Judges, it would not hesitate to restrain them. One of the causes for complaint of the general administration of justice is the expense it entails upon the litigations, and, so far as it reasonable may do so, this court is anxious to minimize the basis for such complaints. There is no reason why a patent litigant should be subjected to any greater expense than any other litigant, except as it may be involved in the inherent and inevitable difference between the presentation of the issues as to the merit and validity of a patent grant and that which obtains in the litigation of an ordinary bill for relief in equity, or of an action at law upon a debt or for a tort.\n Of course courts must exercise a discretion in reference to the order of business to be conducted before them, and all the cases cannot be heard at once. It is in the interest of economy of time that there should be hearings, first \n\n[272 U.S. 701, 708]\n\u00a0\n in one class of cases, and then in another, provided each class may be given an opportunity within a reasonable time. Arguments based on humanity and necessity for the preservation of public order require that criminal cases should be given a reasonable preference, but even this must be conceded with moderation, and what time there is of the court in view of the whole docket must be equitably distributed. The reason given in the order for referring these cases to a special master is that there is congestion in the court's calendar and that there are many other cases entitled to be heard first, including a large number of criminal causes which should be preferred over civil causes as to the trial thereof, that other civil litigation has not been accorded a fair proportion of the time of the court, and that the condition will continue unless many of the patent cases, including this cause, be disposed of by such a reference.\n In view of the recitals of the order, we are not inclined to infer that there has been any deliberate abuse of discretion in this matter or to hold that there may not sometimes be such congestion in the docket as to criminal cases as would justify a District Judge in not literally complying with the requirements of the two rules in question. There was been an emergency due to a lack of judges in some districts which we cannot ignore. We shall therefore deny leave to file this petition, but are content to state our views on the general subject, with confidence that the District Judges will be advised how important we think these two rules are, and that we intend, so far as lies in our power, to make them reasonably effective for the purpose had in view in their adoption.\n Leave denied. \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUCKENBACH S.S.

The compensation fixed at the time by the President not being satisfactory to the claimant, three-fourths of it was paid, and the claimant, conformably to the act, sued to recover a further sum which, with what was paid, was alleged to be just compensation. The Court of Claims found that the amount fixed by the President was just and entered judgment for the claimant for the one-fourth remaining unpaid. 59 Ct. Cl. 628. The claimant, being still dissatisfied, brought the case here.\n The judgment was entered April 28, 1924. The claimant seasonably moved for a new trial and included in \n\n[272 U.S. 533, 535]\n\u00a0\n the motion a request for amended findings. While that motion was pending the claimant, becoming apprehensive lest the time allowed for an appeal might be running, filed with the clerk an application for an appeal from the judgment. Thereafter the motion for a new trial, with the request for amended findings, was denied, and the application for an appeal was then brought to the court's attention and allowed. A little later the claimant applied for an appeal from the order refusing a new trial and amended findings, and the court allowed that appeal.\n Counsel for the United States insist that neither appeal was effective. Plainly the second was not, for it was from an order which was not appealable. But the first was from the judgment, and we think it was well taken. The only infirmity suggested is that the application was premature, in that it was made before the motion for a new trial and amended findings was disposed of. It is true that with that motion pending the judgment was not so far final as to cause time to run against the right to appeal. United States v. Ellicott, \n223 \nU.S. 524, 539\n, 32 S. Ct. 334. But, while the application was thus premature, it was not a nullity. Evidently it was intended to be pressed only if and when the motion for a new trial and amended findings was denied. The court so regarded it, and therefore gave effect to it after disposing of the pending motion. That this was right is shown in Ex parte Roberts, 15 Wall. 384, 385.\n After the record was filed in this court, the claimant moved that the case be remanded to the Court of Claims, with directions either to find or refuse to find each of the several matters specified in the request for amended findings, or, in the alternative, to include in the record the motion for a new trial and that request, together with the evidence on which they were based. Consideration of the motion to remand was postponed to the hearing on the merits, and that hearing has been had.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 533, 536]\n\u00a0\n The presentation of the case on behalf of the claimant has proceeded on the assumption that our power to review is as broad as the power of the Court of Claims to hear and determine in the first instance, and that such a review, if not otherwise provided for, is vouchsafed by the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment. But the assumption is a mistaken one. The Court of Claims is a special tribunal established to hear and determine suits against the United States on claims of specified classes. Except as Congress has consented, there is no right to bring these suits against the United States, and therefore the right arising from the consent is subject to such restrictions as Congress has imposed. McElrath v. United States, \n102 U.S. 426\n, 440. One of these is that the trial shall be by the court without a jury. Another, in force until changed by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, forbade an appellate review where the decision was against the claimant and the amount in controversy was not in excess of $3,000. Others, still in force, limit the scope of the review where one is permitted; and, apart from the nature of these suits, the well-settled rule applies that an appellate review is not essential to due process of law, but is matter of grace. McKane v. Durston, \n153 \nU.S. 684, 687\n, 14 S. Ct. 913; Andrews v. Swartz, \n156 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 15 S. Ct. 389; Kohl v. Lehlback, \n160 \nU.S. 293, 297\n, 299 S., 16 S. Ct. 304; Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 23 S. Ct. 390; The Francis Wright, \n105 U.S. 381\n, 386; Montana Co. v. St. Louis Mining & Milling Co., \n152 \nU.S. 160, 171\n, 14 S. Ct. 506.\n The Constitution (article 3,  2) declares the appellate jurisdiction of this court shall be subject to 'such exceptions' and be exercised under 'such regulations' as Congress may prescribe. This provision was much considered in The Francis Wright, supra, and the views there expressed are particularly apposite here. The court said (page 386 (26 L. Ed. 1100)):\n\n\n[272 U.S. 533, 537]\n\u00a0\n 'Authority to limit the jurisdiction necessarily carries with it authority to limit the use of the jurisdiction. Not only may whole classes of cases be kept out of the jurisdiction altogether, but particular classes of questions may be subjected to re-examination and review, while others are not. To our minds it is no more unconstitutional to provide that issues of fact shall not be retried in any case, than that neither issues of law nor fact shall be retried in cases where the value of the matter in dispute is less than $5,000. The general power to regulate implies power to regulate in all things. The whole of a civil law appeal may be given, or a part. The constitutional requirements are all satisfied if one opportunity is had for the trial of all parts of a case. Everything beyond that is matter of legislative discretion, not of constitutional right.'\n Save in special cases not needing present mention, Congress never has provided for a general review by this court of cases coming from the Court of Claims. On the contrary-and probably because that court is composed of five judges, all usually hearing cases together, and the concurrence of three being necessary to a decision in any case-Congress has pursued the policy of permitting only a limited review on questions of law; and the procedural rules applicable to such cases which this court has promulgated under congressional authorization always have recognized that policy. The rules in force when this case was before the Court of Claims are copied in the margin. \n1\n Others promulgated since, \n\n[272 U.S. 533, 538]\n\u00a0\n and equally recognizing the same policy, are also copied there. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n This court uniformly has regarded the legislation and rules as confining the review to questions of law shown by the record when made up as the rules direct. Bills of exception are not recognized in either the legislation or the rules; nor is there other provision for bringing the evidence into the record or including therein the various rulings involved in applying to the evidence presented the rules which mark the line between what properly may be considered and what must be rejected. As long ago as Mahan v. United States, 14 Wall. 109, 111, this court said of the rules that they could not be examined 'with- \n\n[272 U.S. 533, 539]\n\u00a0\n out seeing that the purpose was to bring nothing here for review but questions of law, leaving the Court of Claims to exercise the functions of a jury in finding facts, equivalent to a special verdict, and with like effect.' Other cases establish that where the findings are ambiguous, contradictory or silent in respect of a material matter, or appear on their face ill-founded in point of law, the case may and should be remanded for corrected or additional findings, but that the mere assertion on the part of a complaining party that they are against the evidence or not supported by it, or give too much or too little weight to particular evidence, affords no ground for so remanding the case, because that is to be done only where the need for correction or addition is apparent either on the face of the findings or when they are examined in connection with the pleadings. United States v. Adams, 6 Wall. 101, 110, 112; Moore v. United States, 91 U. S. \n\n[272 U.S. 533, 540]\n\u00a0\n 270; United States v. Smith, \n94 \nU.S. 214, 218\n, 219 S.; United States v. Clark, \n96 \nU.S. 37, 38\n, 39 S.; McClure v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 145\n, 6 S. Ct. 321; Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 154\n, 6 S. Ct. 325; same case, \n116 \nU.S. 402\n, 6 S. Ct. 631; District of Columbia v. Barnes, \n197 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 25 S. Ct. 401; Brothers v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 39 S. Ct. 426.\n In this case the findings are direct, free from ambiguity, consistent, fully responsive to the issues, and contain nothing indicating that they or any of them are ill-founded in point of law; and the unavoidable conclusion from them is that the judgment is for the right sum, unless there be merit in a contention respecting interest to be noticed later on. So, whether taken by themselves or in connection with the pleadings, they are not open to criticism, unless possibly as to the matter of interest.\n A copy of the motion for a new trial and request for amended findings is exhibited with the motion to remand. The motion for a new trial brought nothing new into the case, and the order overruling it is not open to review. The request for amended findings asked that two of the findings be changed-one by including therein matters which at most are plainly evidential and subordinate, and therefore not to be included in a finding of ultimate facts; and the other by increasing the amount found to be just compensation for the vessels at the time they were taken over from $1,500, 000 to $4,777,000-more than three times what the court found it to be. Whether one amount or the other was the true one was a question of fact. The court refused to change the finding and thereby affirmed that the fact was as stated therein. This court cannot re-examine the question, and the fact that the claimant is still dissatisfied constitutes no ground for remanding the question to the Court of Claims for re-examination by it. As part of its request for amended findings the claimant tendered 27 additional findings and asked that they be adopted. All were rejected. There is no showing \n\n[272 U.S. 533, 541]\n\u00a0\n that they had been tendered theretofore in conformity to the fifth rule, before quoted; and if that was not done the claimant was not in a position to press them. United States v. Driscoll, 131 U. S. Appendix, clix. As to many, if not all, there are also other reasons why the court was free to reject them. Many state matters which, even if true, are eivdential only; some are merely argumentative, and others contain statements having no relation to the issues under the pleadings. It must be held therefore that neither the motion for a new trial nor the request for amended findings gives any support to the motion to remand. Independently of them it lays no foundation for granting what it asks.\n The remaining question is whether there should have been an allowance of interest. The vessels were not taken over at the outset, nor until after the compensation had been fixed by the President at $1,500,000 and the officer who was to take them over had been instructed to pay that sum to the claimant on receiving the vessels with proof of ownership and bill of sale. The claimant was advised of this, and possession of the vessels was passed to the officer a few days later. But it developed that the claimant, although theretofore in possession and operating the vessels, was the real owner of only two of them. The claimant then procured bills of sale to it from the owners of the other vessels and executed a bill of sale to the United States for all. This was about two weeks after possession was passed to the officer. The officer was prepared and willing to pay the full $1,500,000 when the bill of sale was delivered to him, but the claimant was not willing to accept it as full compensation. Afterwards the claimant elected to accept three-fourths of it, and to reserve a right to sue for enough more to make full compensation. The three-fourths was then paid. This was about six weeks after the delivery of the bill of sale. The judgment awards the remaining one-fourth as a sufficient \n\n[272 U.S. 533, 542]\n\u00a0\n sum, with that already paid, to make just compensation for the vessels at the time they were taken over. In short, while the United States was prepared, willing and offering when the vessels were taken over to pay the sum now adjudged to have been just compensation at that time, the claimant was not then in a position entitling it to demand or receive compensation because as yet it was without a good title and had not executed a bill of sale to the United States; and after it became entitled to compensation it rejected the offer, which was still outstanding, to pay that sum in full payment and elected to accept three-fourths as a partial payment and to take chances on enlarging the compensation by resorting to this suit against the United States. The effort to obtain an enlargement has resulted, as already shown, in establishing that the amount offered and rejected was all that justly could have been demanded. In these circumstances we think such postponement as has occurred in the actual payment of the compensation is attributable entirely to the claimant, and therefore that an allowance of interest to the time of payment is not in this case made essential by the constitutional provision expounded and applied in Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 43 S. Ct. 354; and Brooks-Scanlon Corporation v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106, 123\n, 44 S. Ct. 471.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule I.\n In all cases hereafter decided in the Court of Claims, in which, by the act of Congress, such appeals are allowable, they shall be heard in the Supreme Court upon the following record, and none other:\n (1) A transcript of the pleadings in the case, of the final judgment or decree of the court, and of such interlocutory orders, rulings, judgments, and decrees as may be necessary to a proper review of the case.\n (2) A finding by the Court of Claims of the facts in the case, established by the evidence, in the nature of a special verdict, but not the evidence establishing them; and a separate statement of the conclusions of law upon said facts on which the court founds its judgment or decree.

DELPARK(1926)\nNo. 220\nArgued: March 16, 1926Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas J. Johnston, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Archibald Cox, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Philip A. Luckett is a citizen of Connecticut. He brought this bill in equity in the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey against Del- \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n park, a corporation of New York, and against Parker, Ford & Dick, a corporation, formerly known as the Luckett Company, organized in the state of Maryland. Appearing for the purpose of the motion only, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, because the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the bill. The certificate by the District Court shows its dismissal on that ground September 17, 1924. This appeal was allowed November 24, 1924, so that it is maintainable under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1215), in accordance with the saving provision of section 14 of the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 942.\n Section 51 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1033) provides that, where the jurisdiction is founded on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suits shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The requisite diverse citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendants exists in this suit, but the district of New Jersey is not the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendants, and against defendants' objection jurisdiction on that ground cannot be sustained.\n The plaintiff asserts that jurisdiction exists as of a suit under the patent laws under Judicial Code, s 24, par. 7, section 48, and section 256 ( Comp. St. ss 991, 1030, 1233). Section 48 provides that:\n'In suits brought for the infringement of letters patent the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, in law or in equity, in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant, whether a person, partnership, or corporation, shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business.'\n\n The question in this case, then, is whether, it being averred that the defendants regularly do business in New Jersey, and have made and sold there the patented articles referred to in the bill, its allegations make the suit one arising under the patent laws. \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n The bill shows that two patents were issued to Luckett, one on November 12, 1918, No. 1,284,391, and the other on October 12, 1915, No. 1, 156,301, for a method of making undergarments known as union suits. The later patent, No. 1,284,391, is averred to be the generic and the broader invention, while the earlier patent, No. 1,156,301, is a specific and narrower one. After the later patent was applied for, before it was granted, Luckett gave a nonexclusive license for manufacture and sale of the garments under it to the Delpark corporation. This reserved to Luckett a royalty on all garments manufactured and sold under it, the licensee covenanting to give access to its books of account. A supplementary agreement made the license exclusive. Later Luckett gave to the other defendant, Parker, Ford & Dick, and assignment of the letters patent No. 1, 156,301, under which a particular union suit, known as the 'My Pal' suit, is made, with conditions subsequent that the assignee should pay certain royalties, should keep the accounts open for inspection, and should push vigorously the sale of 'My Pal' suits, and with a provision that, if any condition subsequent failed, the title to the letters patent assigned should revert to Luckett, on his giving the assignee 30 days' notice in writing of his election to resume title. All the contracts of license and assignment made by the plaintiff with each of the defendants are attached to the bill as exhibits.\n The averments of the bill are that Delpark, Incorporated, has acquired control of the stock of the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation, and the defendants are acting together; that the Delpark corporation refuses to pay to Luckett any royalties due under its exclusive license of the generic patent; that the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation refuses to pay any royalties under plaintiff's assignment to it of the specific patent, and refuses to push the sale of 'My Pal' suits; that this refusal is to prevent competition of the 'My Pal' suits with the Delpark suits, \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 501]\n\u00a0\n and thus deprives plaintiff of royalties on the 'My Pal' suits. The plaintiff avers that on November 27, 1918, by notice in writing he cancelled his assignment to the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation, for failure of condition subsequent, and resumed his title to letters patent No. 1,156,301.\n The seventeenth paragraph in the bill, and the only one which uses the word 'infringement,' is as follows:\n'(VII) And your orator further shows unto your honors that Delpark, Incorporated, is a large concern with substantial capital, and ever since the issue of letters patent No. 1,284,391 on November 12, 1918, has been actively engaged in the manufacture and sale of the Delpark garment, so called, which infringes the claims of the said letters patent, and also the claims of letters patent No. 1,156,301, and that large numbers of the said garment have been made and sold upon which royalties are now due to your orator, the amount of which he is wholly unable to state with definiteness, but which is far larger than $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and that, though often requested as hereinbefore set out, no accounting has ever been had between your orator and Delpark, Incorporated, or Parker, Ford & Dick, Inc., either as to royalties due or as to damages for failure to observe the contract to exploit the 'My Pal' garment.'\n\n The plaintiff sets out 13 prayers for equitable relief. He asks that the defendants file statements of the garments made and sold under both patents, containing retail prices at which the garments were sold, in order to show the royalties due; also a statement of the orders received for the 'My Pal' garments, but not filled, with prices, to show the royalties lost, and that they be compelled to permit access to their books of account. He further prays that the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation be required to execute a formal reassignment of letters \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 502]\n\u00a0\n patent No. 1,156,301 to the complainant, so as to remove the cloud from his title to that patent, and that an order issue canceling the licenses and agreements made with both defendants. He prays for damages for suppressing the 'My Pal' garment, and the failure properly to exploit it as agreed.\n In prayer, J, the plaintiff asks that a preliminary injunction issue against both defendants to prevent their making sale or delivery of the so- called Delpark garment, or the so-called 'My Pal' garment, or any other garment infringing the claims of the two letters patent of the plaintiff, until further order of court. By prayer K, a similar permanent injunction is asked. There is a prayer for an order sending the cause to a master to take and state the account of profits and damages, both as to royalties due and accrued, and as to damages for suppression of the 'My Pal' garment, and to report the same to the court.\n We do not think that this suit arises under the patent laws. Its main and declared purpose is to enforce the rights of the plaintiff under his contracts with defendants for royalties and for pushing the sales of 'My Pal' garments. In addition he seeks the reconveyance of one patent on forfeiture for failure of condition to remove a cloud on his title and a cancellation of all agreements of license of the other for their breach in order presumably that, unembarrassed by his assignment and licenses, he may enjoin future infringement.\n It is a general rule that a suit by a patentee for royalties under a license or assignment granted by him, or for any remedy in respect of a contract permitting use of the patent, is not a suit under the patent laws of the United States, and cannot be maintained in a federal court as such.

Ct. 798, \n140 U.S. 344\n; Briggs v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 36 S. Ct. 6, \n239 U.S. 48\n.\n In Wilson v. Sandford, supra, a bill in equity was filed in a federal Circuit Court setting forth complainant's ownership of a patent, an assignment to defendants of a license in consideration of five promissory notes, with a condition of reversion to complainant on failure to pay any note. The bill averred that the first two notes were not paid, insisted that the license was forfeited by the failure and the licensor was fully reinvested at law and in equity with all his original rights, that the defendants were using the patented machine and were infringing the patent, prayed an account of profits since forfeiture, a temporary and permanent injunction, and a reinvestiture of title in the complainant. On demurrer, the bill was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as not arising under the patent laws. Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the court, said:\n'The rights of the parties depend altogether upon common-law and equity principles. The object of the bill is to have this contract set aside and declared to be forfeited, and the prayer is 'that the appellant's reinvestiture of title to the license granted to the appellees, by reason of the forfeiture of the contract, may be sanctioned by the court,' and for an injunction. But the injunction he asks for is in consequence of the decree of the court sanctioning the forfeiture. He alleges no ground for an injunction unless the contract is set aside; and if the case made in the bill was a fit one for relief in equity, it is very clear that whether the contract ought to be declared forfeited or not, in a court of chancery, depended altogether upon the rules and principles of equity, and in no degree whatever upon any act of Congress concerning patent rights.'\n\n The bill in the present case cannot in any respect be distinguished from that in Wilson v. Sandford, as this \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 504]\n\u00a0\n language of the opinion shows. But counsel for the appellant here insists that a new and more liberal rule has been adopted by this court in later cases, and that the time has now come for recognizing it by taking what he calls the last step.\n In the common feature of Wilson v. Sandford and the case before us, jurisdiction falls because the complainant in his bill seeks forfeiture of licensed rights in equity before he can rely on the patent laws to enjoin infringement of his patent rights and obtain damages therefor. There has been no variation from the authority and effect of the case cited on this point. New Marshall Co. v. Marshall Engine Co., 32 S. Ct. 238, \n223 U.S. 473\n, 480; White v. Lee (C.

A.) 290 F. 876.\n The cases cited as qualifying Wilson v. Sandford are White v. Rankin, 12 S. Ct. 768, \n144 U.S. 628\n; Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., 22 S.

Ct. 658, \n237 U.S. 479\n, and Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, 35 S. Ct. 788, \n238 U.S. 254\n. We think that none of these cases shakes the authority of Wilson v. Sandford upon the point here in question, or can be used to sustain the present bill. The case which has been 'blown upon' is that of Hartell v. Tilghman, supra, in which the opinion of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for himself and three other justices, and in which Mr. Justice Bradley \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 505]\n\u00a0\n announced a dissenting opinion in which two others concurred. That case was a suit in equity in which the complainant set up a process patent and complained that defendants were infringing by using the process without license and prayed an injunction and a decree for profits and damages. The bill further averred that negotiations had been had between the parties looking to a license, beginning with a verbal agreement by complainant that he should put up machinery for use of defendants in their shop in using the patent, and that thereafter defendants should take a license on certain well-understood conditions, that complainant under the verbal agreement put up the machinery and was paid for it and received royalties under it for use of the patent for some months, that on tender of contract forms for the license defendants refused to sign, and that on such refusal complainant forbade defendants to use the process and brought the suit. The majority relied on Wilson v. Sandford, and held that the suit was not under patent laws; that complainant could not himself rescind the verbal contract, treat it as a nullity and charge the defendants as infringers, but must preliminarily seek rescission in a court of equity. Mr. Justice Bradley's view was that the plaintiff in his bill had chosen to place himself on the infringement of his patent as his sole ground, and that by anticipation of the defense and his answer to it in his bill, as allowed by equity pleading he did not change its nature.\n In White v. Rankin, supra, it was held that a bill in equity for the infringement of letters patent for an invention in the usual form, which did not mention or refer to any contract with the defendants for the use of the patent, could not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because the defendants in a plea set up an agreement in writing between the plaintiffs and one of the defendants to assign to him an interest in the patent on certain conditions which he alleged he had performed, and certain other \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 506]\n\u00a0\n matters which it was alleged had given the defendant the right to make, use and sell the patented invention. The plea being overruled and the answer filed, a stipulation in writing was entered into, admitting that the defendants had made and sold the articles containing the patented inventions, and that a certain written agreement had been made to the purport before mentioned. The decision of the court was that the jurisdiction was established by the averments of the bill, and that the defense constituted a mere issue as to the title to the patent, but could not oust the jurisdiction which rested on the averments of the bill.\n In Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., supra, and exclusive licensee filed a bill against the patentee and another party, to whom the patentee had granted a conflicting license. This court held that the patent jurisdiction of the court was not ousted by reason of allegations in the answer that the plaintiff had forfeited all his rights under the license thought his failure to comply with its terms and conditions, by reason of which the license had been revoked by the patentee. Complainant was an exclusive licensee, which sought damages for infringement of its license and the patent against the patentee and one to whom he had granted a subsequent and conflicting license. In such a case the licensee had the right to sue the patentee on the patent. Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205; Independent Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corporation of America, 46 S. Ct. 166, \n269 U.S. 459\n, opinion January 11, 1926. The case was held to be a suit for infringement under the patent laws, jurisdiction in which was not ousted because the patentee had led a third person to infringe the patent and the first license.\n In Henry v. Dick Co., supra, the patentee for a kind of ink filed a bill for infringement against the users of his patent whom the bill showed to be using the ink in connection with unpatented supplies not made by the \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 507]\n\u00a0\n patentee in violation of a license from the patentee limited to its use with its supplies. The case has been since reversed on the merits (Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 37 S. Ct. 416, \n243 U.S. 502\n, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959), but not on the point of jurisdiction. It was objected that the suit was not a suit under the patent laws but a suit on the license contract. It was held that the patentee might waive the contract and sue on the tort of infringement, that jurisdiction must depend on the remedy it chose and sought in its bill, and that, as the patentee had neither sued on the broken contract of license nor asked to have it forfeited by the court, the jurisdiction under the patent laws was not ousted.\n In The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., supra, the Kohler Company brought a bill in equity to enjoin The Fair from making and vending certain devices and selling them at less than $1.50 each, and asked an account and triple damages. The bill alleged that plaintiff had the sole and exclusive right to make and sell devices and that the defendant had full notice thereof and was selling the same without license from the plaintiff. It alleged that the plaintiff, when it sold, imposed the condition that the good should not be sold at less than $1.50, and attached to the goods a notice to that effect, and that any sale in violation of that condition would be an infringement. It further averred that the defendant obtained a stock of the devices with notice of the conditions, and sold them at $1.25 each, in infringement of the plaintiff's right under the patent. The defendant pleaded specially that he had purchased these devices from a jobber, who had paid full price to the plaintiff, and that there was no question arising under the patent or other laws of the United States, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the case. The case came on for hearing on the plea. This court held that on the bill the plaintiff made a case under the patent laws, in that it set up the patent, charged \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 508]\n\u00a0\n infringement, and sought triple damages, and that, in showing later in the bill that the infringement consisted in a sale at a less price than that which it had authorized in an admitted license, it did not oust the court of jurisdiction, because it might appear upon further hearing of the cause on its merits that the restriction of the license upon which the claim of infringement was based was not valid.\n In Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., supra, the bill alleged ownership of the exclusive right to make and use box-making machines and sell boxes containing the patented improvements. It further alleged that the defendant was infringing the patents, and would continue to do so unless restrained. Anticipating a defense, the plaintiff set out a license to the defendant, a breach of its conditions, and a termination of the same. It added that the license contained a stipulation that, in case of any suit for infringement, the measure of recovery should be the same as the royalty agreed upon for the use of the inventions, and another for the return of the machines let to the defendant while the license was in force. The bill prayed for an injunction against making, using, or selling the boxes or machines, for an account of profits received by reason of the infringement, for triple the damages measured as above stated, and for the surrender of the machines. In sustaining the jurisdiction as arising under the patent laws, the court used these words:\n'It may be that the reasoning of The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co. (33 S. Ct. 410) \n228 U.S. 22\n (57 L. Ed. 716), is more consistent with that of Mr. Justice Bradley's dissent in Hartell v. Tilghman, \n99 U.S. 547\n, 556 (25 L. Ed. 357), a decision since explained and limited (White v. Rankin (12 S. Ct. 768) \n144 U.S. 628\n (36 L. Ed. 569 )), than with that of the majority, but it is the deliberate judgment of the court and governs this case. As stated there, the plaintiff is absolute master of what jurisdiction he will appeal to; and if he goes to the District Court for \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 509]\n\u00a0\n infringement of a patent, unless the claim is frivolous or a pretense, the District Court will have jurisdiction on that ground, even though the course of the subsequent pleadings reveals other more serious disputes. Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co. (22 S. Ct. 681) \n185 U.S. 282\n (46 L. Ed. 910). Jurisdiction generally depends upon the case made and relief demanded by the plaintiff, and as it cannot be helped, so it cannot be defeated, by the replication to an actual or anticipated defense contained in what used to be the charging part of the bill. For the same reason it does not matter whether the validity of the patent is admitted or denied.\n\n'As appears from the statement of it, the plaintiffs' case arose under the patent law. It was not affected by the fact that the plaintiffs relied upon a contract as fixing the mode of estimating damages or that they sought a return of patented machines to which if there was no license they were entitled. These were incidents. The essential features were the allegation of an infringement and prayers for an injunction, an account of profits and triple damages-the characteristic forms of relief granted by the patent law. The damages were grounded on the infringement, and the contract was relied upon only as furnishing the mode in which they should be ascertained.'\n\n In Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, supra, the patentee charged the defendants in his bill in equity with contributing to the infringement by wrongfully persuading the licensees of the complainant to use the patent in circumstances not authorized by the license; second, with wrongfully procuring such licensees to violate their licenses in particulars not bearing on the charge of infringement; and third, with refusing to perform stipulations by which defendants agreed to assign other patents to plaintiff. Jurisdiction of the court under the patent laws, which was the sole basis of jurisdiction, was sustained for the first branch of the suit, because the claim of infringement \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 510]\n\u00a0\n was not frivolous but substantial, and there was jurisdiction, whether the claim ultimately was held good or bad. The remainder of the bill was found not sustainable as arising under the patent laws, because based on contract, and while, under the equity practice, the parts of the bill were properly joined, such practice must yield to a jurisdictional statute, and the bill was dismissed as to its second and third branches.\n The result of these cases is that a federal district court is held to have jurisdiction of a suit by a patentee for an injunction against infringement and for profits and damages, even though in anticipation of a defense of a license or authority to use the patent, the complainant includes in his bill averments intended to defeat such a defense. If these averments do not defeat such defense, the patentee will lose his case on the merits, but the court's jurisdiction under the patent laws is not ousted. The error in Hartell v. Tilghman, supra, was in denying jurisdiction under the patent laws when the patentee based his action broadly on his patent and averment of infringement seeking injunction and damages. His averments, intended to constitute a reply to the anticipated defense that the defendant was a licensee, did not change the nature of his declared choice of a suit under the patent laws. This, under the principle now established by the later cases, and especially The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co. and Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co. is clear. But the present qualification of the Hartell Case does not affect the principle, laid down in Wilson v. Sandford, that where a patentee complainant makes his suit one for recovery of royalties under a contract of license or assignment, or for damages for a breach of its covenants, or for a specific performance thereof, or asks the aid of the court in declaring a forfeiture of the license, or in restoring an unclouded title to the patent, he does not give the federal District Court jurisdiction of the cause as one arising under the patent laws. Now may he confer it in such a case by \n\n[270 U.S. 496, 511]\n\u00a0\n adding to his bill an averment that after the forfeiture shall be declared, or the title to the patent shall be restored, he fears the defendant will infringe, and therefore asks an injunction to prevent it. That was Wilson v. Sandford. If in that case the patentee complainant had based his action on his patent right and had sued for infringement, and by anticipation of a defense of the assignment had alleged a forfeiture by his own declaration without seeking aid of the court, jurisdiction under the patent laws would have attached, and he would have had to meet the claim by the defendant that forfeiture of the license or assignment and restoration of title could not be had except by a decree of a court, which, if sustained, would have defeated his prayer for an injunction on the merits. But when the patentee exercises his choice, and bases his action on the contract, and seeks remedies thereunder, he may not give the case a double aspect, so to speak, and make it a patent case conditioned on his securing equitable relief as to the contract. That is the principle settled by Wilson v. Sandford, and is still the law.\n It is true that in Mr. Justice Bradley's dissenting opinion, in Hartell v. Tilghman, supra, page 559, he says, in reference to Wilson v. Sandford, that if the question were a new one he would think that it would not oust the jurisdiction under the patent laws for the complainant to join in a bill for infringement, as ancillary to the relief sought, an application to avoid an inequitable license. But no subsequent case has gone so far, and we are not disposed to depart from the rule of Wilson v. Sandford, whatever might be our conclusion if it were a new question. Moreover, the bill in this case, as we have already fully pointed out, is really not based on threatened infringement, but on the contracts, and its reference to infringements is inadequate even to present a bill in the form suggested by Mr. Justice Bradley.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMA-KING PRODUCTS CO. v. BLAIR(1926)\nNo. 333\nArgued: May 7, 1926Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. B. D. Oliensis and Charles L. Guerin, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the Ma-King Products Company, a corporation, in the Federal District \n\n[271 U.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n Court for Western Pennsylvania, against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The bill alleged that the Company had duly made application to the Commissioner, in accordance with the National Prohibition Act1 and regulations, and accompanied by a proper bond, for a permit to operate a plant for denaturing alcohol; and that, while under the law the Commissioner was authorized to grant such a permit, he had 'arbitrarily, illegally and without any reason or warrant in law or in fact' disapproved the application and refused to issue the permit. The prayer was that the court review the Commissioner's action, reverse his findings as to fact and law, and direct him to approve the application and grant the permit.\n The Commissioner answered, denying that he had acted arbitrarily and illegally in disapproving the Company's application; and, alleging that, as the result of an investigation conducted by his agents, he was informed that the president and secretary-treasurer of the Company were not individually, or as its officers, 'entitled to be entrusted with a permit of the nature and kind set forth in the application,' under the provisions of the Act; and that, upon this information, he 'acted under full warrant of law and fact' in disapproving the application and refusing to issue the permit.\n After a hearing before two District Judges, at which evidence was introduced by both sides, the judges concurred in the opinion that there was nothing in the record which would justify the court in finding that the Commissioner in refusing the application for the permit had 'abused the wide discretion invested in him by the Act of Congress,' and that the bill should therefore be dismissed; and a decree was entered accordingly. This was affirmed, on appeal, by the Circuit Court of Appeals, \n\n[271 U.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n which said that:\n'After an examination of the proofs in the case we are of the opinion the associations and business connections of ... the principal officers of this company, were such that the Commissioner had ample ground for declining to issue the company the permit. The holder of such a permit is entrusted by the goverment with a power which subjects him to the approaches and bribes of law breakers, and where, as in this case, the business associations of applicants have been with men whose conduct has already invited prohibition prosecutions against them, it goes without saying that the Commissioner would have been derelict in duty in granting them a permit.' 3 F.(2d) 936.\n\n This appeal was allowed in March, 1925\n\n\n Titile 2 of the Prohibition Act provides that 'all the provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented'; that, with certain exceptions not here material, no one 'shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do'; that no permit shall be issued to any person who within one year prior to the application therefor shall have violated the terms of any permit or any Federal or State law regulating traffic in liquors; that no permit shall be issued 'until a verified, written application shall have been made therefor, setting forth the qualification of the applicant and the purpose for which the liquor is to be used'; that the commissioner 'may prescribe the form of all permits and applications and the facts to be set forth therein,' and before any permit is granted 'may require a bond in such form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and the provisions of' the title; and that if the Commissioner refuses any application for a permit, the applicant 'may have a review of the decision by a court of equity,' which may affirm, \n\n[271 U.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n modify or reverse' his finding 'as the facts and law of the case may warrant.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It is clear that the Act does not impose on the Commissioner the mere ministerial duty of issuing a permit to any one making an application on the prescribed form, but, on the contrary, places upon him, as the administrative officer directly charged with the enforcement of the law, a responsibility in the matter of granting the privilege of dealing in liquor for nonbeverage purposes, which requires him to refuse a permit to one who is not a suitable person to be entrusted, in a relation of such confidence, with the possession, of liquor susceptible of division to beverage uses.\n The dominant purpose of the Act is to prevent the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage, and all its provisions are to be liberally construed to that end. It does not provide that the Commissioner shall issue any liquor permit, but merely that he may do so. It specifically requires the application to show 'the qualification of the applicant,' and authorizes the Commissioner to prescribe, 'the facts to be set forth therein.' These provisions, as well as the purpose of the Act, are entirely inconsistent with any intention on the part of Congress that the Commissioner should perform the merely perfunctory duty of granting a permit, to any and every applicant, without reference to his qualification and fitness; and they necessarily imply that, in order to prevent violations of the Act he shall, before granting a permit, determine, in the exercise of his sound discretion, whether the applicant is a fit person to be entrusted with such a privilege. This is emphasized by the provision that if the Commissioner refuses an application, his action may be reviewed by a court of equity in matter of fact and law; there being no substantial reason for this provision if he is imperatively \n\n[271 U.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n required to grant a permit upon the mere presentation of an application in due form.\n On the other hand, it is clear that Congress in providing that an adverse decision of the Commissioner might be reviewed in a court of equity, did not undertake to vest in the court the administrative function of determining whether or not the permit should be granted; but that this provision is to be construed, in the light of the well-established rule in analogous cases, as merely giving the court authority to determine whether, upon the facts and law, the action of the Commissioner is based upon an error of law, or is wholly unsupported by the evidence or clearly arbitrary or capricious. See Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 45 S. Ct. 69, and cases cited.\n Here, plainly, the refusal of the permit involved no error of law. And the two courts below have, in effect, concurred in finding, upon the entire evidence, that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the Commissioner; the Circuit Court of Appeals specifically finding that the associations and business connections of the principal officers of the company were such that he had ample ground for declining to issue the permit. An examination of the evidence-which need not be recited here discloses no clear error which would authorize us to set aside this concurrent finding. United States v.

St. s 991)) to recover on War Saving Certificates with stamps attached, issued under the Acts of September 24, 1917, c. 56, s 6, 40 Stat. 288, 291, and of September 24, 1918, c. 176, s 2, 40 Stat. 965, 966 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 6829l). The certificates fell due on January 1, 1923, but were stolen in the preceding year. They bore the name of the plaintiff or of different members of his family who had transferred their claim to him, but they were not registered. The plaintiff offers to give a sufficient bond of indemnity. The bill was dismissed by the District Court and the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the right to recover was excluded by the certificates on their face. 298 F. 295.\n The certificates were sheets with blanks for the affixing of stamps issued by the Government for the purpose, face value five dollars each. They were not valid without one stamp affixed, and there were blanks for twenty in all, which could be added from time to time if and when desired. The certificate declared that, subject to the conditions thereon, the owner named on the back would be entitled on January 1, 1923, to receive the amount indicated by the stamps. Among the conditions are provisions for registration and notice that unless registered the United States will not be liable for payment to one not the owner; that upon payment the certificate must be surrendered and a receipt signed by the \n\n[270 U.S. 7, 9]\n\u00a0\n owner; and that upon satisfactory evidence of the loss of a registered certificate the owner shall be entitled to payment of the registered amount. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that these conditions very plainly imported what on January 21, 1918, was embodied by the Secretary of the Treasury in an authorized regulation, that unregistered certificates would not be paid if lost. There was good reason for the condition. The stamps are undistinguishable one from another. Therefore they could be detached and put upon another certificate, and it would be impossible for the Government to know whether the stolen stamps that gave the value to the certificate had been paid or not. The offer of indemnity was illusory, and the case is not like that of a lost bond. The condition limited the obligation of the Government to pay and until it is complied with the plaintiff must put up with his loss.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARION & RYE VALLEY RY.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. A. A. McLaughlin, of Des Moines, Iowa, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Marion & Rye Valley Railway Company, a short line railroad, brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover $14,425.94 as compensation for the alleged taking possession and use by the United States of its railroad during the period beginning December 28, 1917, and ending June 29, 1918. That sum is the amount which, on September 30, 1922, a board of referees appointed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 454 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 3115 3\/4 c) found to be just. The application for the appointment of the board was made after the Director General had refused to pay the company any compensation. \n1\n The suit was begun after he had refused to accept the report as a basis for settlement. The case was heard upon a stipulation of the facts which the court adopted as its findings. The government denied liability. It contended that there was not a legal taking, because the President did \n\n[270 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n not take actual possession of the railroad, did not operate it, and did not otherwise exercise control. It contended, also, that, even if there was a technical taking of possession, the plaintiff was not entitled to any compensation because it suffered no pecuniary loss. Both contentions were sustained by the court, and judgment was entered for the defendant on January 26, 1925. 60 Ct. Cl. 230. The appeal was duly taken under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1219). We have no occasion to determine whether in law the President took possession and assumed control of the Marion & Rye Valley Railway. For even if there was technically a taking, the judgment for defendant was right. Nothing was recoverable as just compensation, because nothing of value was taken from the company, and it was not subjected by the government to pecuniary loss. Nominal damages are not recoverable in the Court of Claims. Grant v. United States, 7 Wall. 331, 338.\n Power to take possession and assume control of any railroad, on account of the war emergency, had been conferred upon the President by Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 (Comp. St. s 1974a). See Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 39 S. Ct. 502, \n250 U.S. 135\n, 142-147; Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, 41 S. Ct. 593, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 556-557; St. Louis, Kennett & Southeastern R. R. Co. v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 245, \n267 U.S. 346\n. The President issued, on December 26, 1917, a proclamation which recited that '(I) do hereby ... take possession and assume control at 12 o'clock noon on the twenty-eighth day of December, 1917, of each and every system of transportation ... consisting of railroads, ...' and a Director General was appointed. 40 Stat. 1733. Some general notices or orders by the Director General were received by the Marion & Rye Railway Company shortly after the issue of the proclamation; but no order dealing specifically with that railroad was given by him. He did not at any time take over the actual possession or operation of the rail- \n\n[270 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n road, did not at any time give any specific direction as to its management or operation, and did not at any time interfere in any way with its conduct or activities. The company retained possession and continued in the operation of its railroad throughout the period in question. The railroad was operated during the period exactly as it had been before, without change in the manner, method or purpose of operation. The railroad did not serve any military camp, nor did it transport troops or munitions. The character of the traffic remained the same. Nothing appears to have been done by the Director General which could have affected the volume or profitableness of the traffic or have increased the requirements for maintenance or depreciation, and apparently it retained its earnings, expended the same as it saw fit, and, without accounting to the government, devoted the net operating income to the company's use.\n The company urges that the claim sought to be enforced rests upon a statutory right to the just compensation specifically defined in section 1 of the Federal Control Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 3115 3\/4 a); that the compensation there prescribed is for the rental value at the rate of the average annual railway operating income for the three years ended June 30, 1917; that by the taking, although technical, the government agreed to pay the compensation defined in the statute; that the function of the board of referees, acting under the statute, was to find that sum 'as nearly as may be'; and that by its report it had done so. It is true that in this case the claim is founded upon 'a law of Congress'- not upon a 'contract, express or implied.' Judicial Code, s 145, par. Frist (Comp. St. s 1136). Recovery cannot be sought upon the contract implied in fact which, in view of the constitutional obligation justly to compensate for property taken by eminent domain, ordinarily arises on a taking of private property by the government pursuant to law, where no provision is made by statute for ascertaining the amount \n\n[270 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n of compensation or for enforcing payment. Compare United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., 5 S. Ct. 306, \n112 U.S. 645\n; Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Garland, 8 S. Ct. 631, \n124 U.S. 581\n; Tempel v. United States, 39 S. Ct. 56, \n248 U.S. 121\n, 129. Here both the method of determining the amount and the means of enforcing payment are prescribed by statute. Compare William Cramp & Sons, etc., Co. v. International Curtis Marine Turbine Co., 38 S. Ct. 271, \n246 U.S. 28\n. But the question remains what is the amount recoverable. Did the Federal Control Act merely confer authority upon the President to enter into an agreement to pay as much as the so-called 'standard return,' or did it also direct him, if such an agreement was not reached, to make payment on the basis of the 'standard return'?\n Congress has power to recognize moral obligations. United States v. Realty Co., 16 S. Ct. 1120, \n163 U.S. 427\n, 441-443. Hence it could have provided for payment on the basis of the standard return, even where there was no damage according to the rules of law ordinarily applicable to takings by eminent domain. Congress did not, however, direct the President to make such payment. It merely authorized him to agree with any carrier of whose railroad he took possession and control that it should 'receive as just compensation an annual sum ... for each year and pro rata for any fractional year of such federal control, not exceeding a sum equivalent as nearly as may be to its average annual railway operating income for the three years ended June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and seventeen.' The provision did not establish a rule of compensation. The President was not permitted to agree to pay more, but he was left free to refuse to pay that sum. The carrier was left free to reject any offer that might be made. Where no agreement was reached, the carrier was relegated by section 3 to proceedings for ascertaining the amount of just compensation. The question thus becomes one of determining the 'just conpensation' for the use taken or damage done. If Congress had intended \n\n[270 U.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n that the 'standard return' should be taken as the measure of just compensation, in any event, there would have been no occasion for a hearing before a board of referees. The amount so payable could have been determined by calculation from the 'average' annual railway operating income which, by section 1 of the Federal Control Act, p. 452, the Interstate Commerce Commission itself was required to ascertain and to certify to the President.\n Thus, the fact that the right to recover compensation is a statutory one, did not relieve the railroad from the burden of proving the value of the use taken from the company or the damage suffered by it under rules ordinarily applicable to takings by eminent domain. Compare Mitchell v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 293, \n267 U.S. 341\n, 345. Nor did the report of the board of referees supply the necessary evidence. It is true that section 3 of the Federal Control Act makes the report of the referees 'prima facie evidence of the amount of just compensation and of the facts therein stated.' But the legal effect of evidence is a question of law. The presumption otherwise attaching to a finding of the board was overcome by the facts stated in the report and in the findings of the Court of Claims. The board was required to 'consider all the facts and circumstances,' and to 'report as soon as practicable in each case to the President the just compensation' so ascertained. Its report discloses that it did not consider 'the facts and circumstances.' Its finding of just compensation rests wholly upon assumptions. It was assumed that compensation for the use of the company's property should be calculated upon the basis of an implied lease and agreement by the government to pay a fair rental although, as the report states, there was 'no evidence as to the amount for which the railroad could have been rented; and there is no likelihood that there was any market for its rental.' It was assumed further that the assumed lease must be deemed to have been made \n\n[270 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n for an indeterminate period, because the duration of federal control could not be foretold on December 28, 1917; that this rental value should be ascertained as of the date of the commencement of federal control, and should be measured, not upon the then immediate outlook for business for the first six months of 1918, but by the then probable earnings for a period of years; and finally that the amount should be fixed at one-half of the average annual operating income for the three years prior to January 1, 1918, and not at the smaller amount actually shown to have been earned during the six months' period and retained by the company. In other words, the board simply adopted as its measure the so-called 'standard return' of the Federal Control Act. No evidence was introduced before it to show that the alleged taking had subjected the company to any pecuniary loss or had deprived it of anything of pecuniary value, although the hearing before the board was commenced long after the period of alleged possession and control had expired. \n2\n The report was therefore without evidential value.\n The opinion of the Court of Claims discloses (pages 253-255) that the company claimed there that, if it was not entitled to recover under the Federal Control Act, it was entitled to recover under section 204 of the Transportation Act of 1920. This contention, overruled below, was not renewed here.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The board entered upon the hearing and made its report despite objection by the Director General that it was without jurisdiction, because the proceeding was commenced after Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 460, had provided by section 204 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 10071 1\/4 bbb) another and exclusive remedy for carriers which, like the plaintiff, had operated their own railroads throughout the period for which compensation was claimed. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On or before July 4, 1918, the plaintiff received from John Barton Payne, General Counsel for the Director General, the following notice:\n'June 24, 1918.\n\n'Dear Sir: It is not clear whether the Marion & Rye Valley Railway Company has at any time been under federal control.

BENTON(1926)\nNo. 296\nArgued: October 13, 1926Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 525, 526]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank W. Morrison, of Worcester, Mass., and Phil D. Swing, of San Diego, Cal., for appellants.\n Messers. Jay R. Benton, Atty. Gen. (Lewis Goldberg, of Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought by different parties having different and unconnected interests seeking a declaration that the Daylight Saving Acts of Massachusetts (Acts 1920, c. 280; Acts 1921, c. 145) are inconsistent with the Act of Congress of March 19, 1918, c. 24 (40 Stat. 450 (Comp. St .  8907r-8907u); see Act Aug. 20, 1919, c. 51, 41 Stat. 280), and unconstitutional and asking an injunction to prevent the several defendants from doing their respective official parts to carry out the Massachusetts law. It was heard by three \n\n[272 U.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n judges in the District Court, and upon motion it was dismissed. 10 F.(2d) 515.\n The act of Congress (section 2) fixes the standard time and provides that:\n'In all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations relating to the time of performance of any act by any officer or department of the United States, whether in the legislative, executive, or judicial branches of the Government, or relating to the time within which any rights shall accrue or determine, or within which any act shall or shall not be performed by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it shall be understood and intended that the time shall be the United States standard time of the zone within which the act is to be performed.'\n\n The Massachusetts statute advances the standard time thus fixed by one hour, and provides that the time shall be the United States standard eastern time so advanced, in all laws, regulations, etc., relating to the time of performance of any act by any officer or department of the Commonwealth or of any county, city, etc., thereof, or relating to the time in which any rights shall accrue or determine, or within which any act shall or shall not be performed by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and in all the public schools and institutions of the Commonwealth, etc., and in all contracts or choses in action made or to be performed in the Commonwealth.\n The court below found no inconsistency between the two Acts and we have seen no sufficient reason for differing from it upon that point. But it also went on the important rule, which we desire to emphasize, that no injunction ought to issue against officers of a State clothed with authority to enforce the law in question, unless in a case reasonably free from doubt and when necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury. Cavanaugh v. Looney, \n248 \nU.S. 453, 456\n, 39 S. Ct. 142; Hygrade Products Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 500\n, 45 S. Ct. 141; Fenner v. Boykin, 271 \n\n[272 U.S. 525, 528]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 240, 46 S. Ct. 492, May 24, 1926. No such necessity is shown here. The corporations other than the Town of Hadley do not even allege any direct interest. The Town of Hadley makes a case that concerns none of the other plaintiffs, and complains only that by failure to comply with the Massachusetts statute it will be held to have lost its claim to certain State aid for its schools. It is said that in fact Hadley has received its share and has no further interest in the case, but in any event it is plain that a Court of the United States would not intervene between a State and a town of the State's creation to determine how far the town should share in the State's benevolence. Of the individual plaintiffs, Mann alleges that the statute makes it more costly for him to employ labor at the first hours of the day, that he owns land on both sides of the New Hampshire line and has to travel to and fro between them, that New Hampshire and the railroad keep to the standard Eastern time, and that to adjust himself to the two standards causes him worry and pecuniary loss. The plaintiff Snow alleges that her children have to get up an hour earlier to go to school and so lose an hour's sleep, and that women who have husbands employed by the railroads as well as children have to keep two standards of time in their heads, and other matters that do not concern her. The plaintiff Clarke alleges nothing that needs mention. Evidently this is not a case for an exception to the general rule.\n Courts sometimes say that there is no jurisdiction in equity when they mean only that equity ought not to give the relief asked. In a strict sense the Court in this case had jurisdiction. It had power to grant an injunction, and if it had granted one its decree, although wrong, would not have been void. But upon the merits we think it too plain to need argument that to grant an injunction upon the allegations of this bill would be to fly in \n\n[272 U.S. 525, 529]\n\u00a0\n the face of the rule which, as we have said, we think should be very strictly observed.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n Unless much said in Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764 is trivial or nonsense, this is a suit against Massachusetts and beyond the possible jurisdiction of federal courts, as expressly declared by the Eleventh Amendment. 'The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State.' Accordingly, the trial court had no jurisdiction and should have dismissed the proceeding for that reason.\n It is well to remember that the Massachusetts Daylight Saving Act is not a criminal statute, that no penalty is prescribed for nonobservance, that no defendant was charged with the duty of enforcement, that no proceeding against any complainant could be instituted thereunder and none was in contemplation.\n The bill discloses a bald purpose to secure an adjudication in respect of the constitutionality of a state statute. In no just sense did it seek protection of any property right threatened with unlawful invasion by an officer claiming to proceed under a void enactment. Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 \nU.S. 516\n, 19 S. Ct. 269, as construed in Ex parte Young, supra, pages 156, 157 (28 S. Ct. 453) ought to be followed and treated as controlling. 'In making an officer of the State a party defendant in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an Act alleged to be unconstitutional it is plain that such officer must have some connection with the enforcement of the Act, or else it is merely making him a party as a representative of the State, and thereby attempting to make the State a party.' \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCARDLE v.

Daniels, of Indianapolis, Ind., Phillip Barton Warren, of Springfield, Ill., Albert Baker, of Indianapolis, Ind., and W. A. McInerny, of South Bend, Ind., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n June 8, 1923, the water company filed with the commission its petition, in which it stated that its rates were too low and proposed a higher schedule. The city of Indianapolis answered, alleging that the rates in force were adequate. After hearing the parties, the commission found that, as of May 31, 1923, the value of the property used was not less than $15,260,400; that the annual return under existing rates would be approximately $800,000; that 7 per cent. was a reasonable rate of return; that the rates in force were insufficient, and that those proposed would be exorbitant and discriminatory; and the commission made an order, effective January 1, 1924, prescribing a schedule increasing some of the rates. In its report it stated that the rates authorized might not produce a 7 per cent. return for the immediate future, but it expressed belief that on the average over a period of approximately three years the schedule would produce an adequate return.\n This suit was brought by the company against the members of the commission to enjoin the enforcement of that order, on the ground that the rates prescribed are confiscatory. The members of the commission answered. The \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 403]\n\u00a0\n city intervened and answered. There was involved the value of the property used, probable earnings, operating expenses, and the amount required to constitute just compensation safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The decree states that the court, in an opinion given orally, sustained as proved the material averments of the complaint, and held that the amount as found by the commission was less than the fair value of the property as of January 1, 1924, by more than $3,500,000, and that 'the fair value of complainant's said property at said time was and is not less than $19,000,000, and that the water rates imposed in that order ... are too low and are confiscatory of complainant's said property,' and it enjoins the enforcement of the order. The members of the commission and the city appeal jointly. Section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n Appellants contend that the court adopted as the measure of value the cost of reproduction new less depreciation, estimated on the basis of spot prices as of January 1, 1924, or gave that figure controlling weight. The appellee says that the cost of reproduction less depreciation, estimated at such prices, was shown to be more than $22,500,000, and that the court did not adopt such costs as a measure or give them undue weight as evidence of value.\n The record contains three reports of the commission dealing with valuations of the company's property. In case No. 1400, the commission, March 15, 1917, reported that, as of January 1, 1917, the value of the company's property used in the public service was not less than $9,500,000. In case No. 6613, the commission, January 2, 1923, reported that, as of December 31, 1921, the valuation of the company's operative and nonoperative property was $16,455,000. In case No. 7080, the commission, November 28, 1923, made the order attacked in this suit. It reported that, as of May 31, 1923, the value of the company's operative property was not less than $15,260,400. \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n In No. 1400, the commission stated: The accounting of complainant and its predecessor was defective, in that there was not a careful division of expenditures between capital account and operating expenses. The plant account of the predecessor company owning and operating the plant from 1869 to 1881, was $1,574,840.04, but it expended more than $200,000 that is not included in that figure. According to complainant's books it expended between April 23, 1881, and January 1, 1917, for construction $6, 112,320.86. The amount of moneys actually invested in the plant exceeded $ 8,000,000, and real estate value had appreciated more than $1,500,000. The commission did not definitely state the original cost of construction or the total expenditures for permanent improvements. It found the cost of reproduction new-including $328,000 for going value and $75,000 for working capital-to be $10,406,431, and that less depreciation $9,670,191. The estimate was based on pre-war prices-those prevailing in 1916 and prior years. It reported that the property could not be duplicated 'today ( January 1, 1917) for less than $12,500,000.' This figure covered only the physical operative property. Nevertheless the commission fixed the 'value of all the property ... that is used and useful for the convenience of the public at not less than $9,500,000.' This is the sum of $8,000,000, stated as the minimum amount of money expended to produce the plant, and $ 1,500,000, the increase in the value of the company's land. It is apparent that the enhancement in the value of the plant other than land was not taken into account, and that nothing was included for cash working capital, or intangible elements of value.\n In case No. 6613, the commission reported that, between January 1, 1917, and November 31, 1922, capital additions amounted to $1,639,146, which, added to $12,500,000, cost of duplication (as erported in case No. 1400), made.$14,139,146. It said the company 'would \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 405]\n\u00a0\n be entitled to have added to this sum reasonable allowances for working cash, going value, water rights, and such other elements as may not have been included in the original figure, and also the value of the nonoperative property which apparently was not included in the original figure. The value on this basis would exceed $16,000,000 for the whole property, without giving any consideration to the enormous enhancement of value of all good property in Indianapolis which has occurred since January 1, 1917.' And the commission set out a number of estimates, based on different price levels, made by its own engineering staff, of which Mr. Earl L. Carter was the head. There is shown, as to physical property only, the cost of reproduction less depreciation estimated on different price bases. Some of these estimates were on quoted market prices of cast iron pipe, and some were on prices approximately 10 per cent. less. This made a difference of about $375,000. The estimates on the lower basis follow:\n Average prices 10 years ending with 1920 $13,979,744 10 years ending with 1921 14,689,078 10 years ending with 1922 15,232,676 5 years ending with 1922 18,335,974 Prices prevailing October 1, 1922 17,328,259\n These include $102,997 to cover materials and supplies.\n The company submitted various estimates made by valuation engineers Hagenah and Erickson. There is shown below, in respect of physical property only, cost of reproduction less depreciation.\n Average prices 10 years ending with 1920 $16,020,456 5 years ending with 1921 20,535,543 Prices prevailing October 1, 1922 19,447,193\n There were added for materials and supplies $100,000, for working capital $135,000, for water rights $500,000, and for going value $2,000, 000.\n The company also submitted estimates and appraisals made by valuation engineers, Sanderson and Porter. \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 406]\n\u00a0\n They estimated cost of reproduction of the 'bare physical property' on prices as of October 1, 1922, at $19,087,560, and on average of prices for ten years ending with 1920 at $16,169,257. Neither of these included anything on account of working capital, water rights, or going value. To cover working capital $267,312 was added, and for water rights and going value $2,355,050.\n By its order the commission fixed the value of the property at $16, 455,000. Its report shows that figure to have been made up as follows:\n Commission's engineering staff's appraisal, cost of reproduction less depreciation, on basis of average level of labor and material prices for the 10-year period ending December 31, 1921, including materials and supplies $14,689,0001 Capital additions form April 1, 1922, to October 31, 1922, at actual cost 215,000 ___ Total physical property $14,904,000 Going value and water rights, 9 1\/2 [p]er cent. 1,416,000 ___ $16,320,000 Working cash capital 135,000 ___ Total value $16,455,000\n In case No. 7080, the commission's valuation of the company's properties used in the public service, as of May 31, 1923, is $1,194,600 less than the amount found by the commission to be the value of all its property-operative and nonoperative, as of October 1, 1922. The total of working capital, water rights and going value was reduced $571,000, and the value of the tangible property $623,600. \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 407]\n\u00a0\n At the trial in the lower court, the company introduced estimates of the cost of reproduction less depreciation, made by Hagenah and Erickson, as follows:\n Prices prevailing December 31, 1923 $22,669,026 Average prices 5 years ending with 1923 $22,652,799 3 years ending with 1923 21,625,358 10 years ending with 1923 19,624,354\n\n To each of these were added $235,000 to cover working capital, consisting of materials, supplies and cash, $500,000 for water rights, and $ 2,000,000 for going value.\n And the company also introduced similar estimates by Sanderson and Porter, as follows:\n\nPrices prevailing December 31, 1923 $21,898,662 Average prices 5 years ending with 1923 21,863,858 3 years ending with 1923 20,968,127 10 years ending with 1923 18,931,979\n To each of these were added $361,245 to cover working capital ( consisting of materials and supplies $127,939, being the average amount on hand in 1923, and $233,306 cash, being one-eighth of one year's gross earnings), $500,000 for water rights, and $2,098,000, going value.\n Mr. Carter testified that his estimate, $14,689,078, adopted by the commission in No. 6613, was based on average prices in the ten years ending with 1921, on the inventory as of April 1, 1922. He said that, based on average prices in ten years ending with 1923, the cost of reproduction less depreciation was $16,006,370, and that between April 1, 1922, and December 31, 1923, there had been made net additions amounting to $1,010,105, making a total in round figures of $17,000,000. And he also testified that on the basis of prices prevailing January 1, 1924, the cost of reproduction less depreciation was $19,500,000. All his estimates covered fixed physical property, material and supplies, but include nothing for cash working capital, water rights or going value. \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 408]\n\u00a0\n The commission's report in No. 6613 highly commends the estimates made by its chief engineer and his assistants. It states that the valuation engineers employed by the company are firms of national reputation and unquestioned standing, and that the difference between appraisals made by its own staff and those presented for the company are due to differences of opinion as to the 'application of the cost of reproduction theory to the ten-year period prices,' details of the work necessary to construct the property, amount to be included for structural overheads, and the condition of certain items of the property. It says that these differences have been analyzed and explained by the parties, and that further analysis and careful weighing of the evidence would be likely to lead to a compromise figure between the two extremes. 'However that may be, the commission is inclined to accept the report of its staff as a basis of value, believing it to be conservative and accurate. Considering all the facts, including all the appraisals and the other evidence concerning the trend of prices, the commission is of the opinion that in this case the average of prices for the ten-year period ending with 1921, the last full ten years available, most nearly represents the fair value of petitioner's physical property.'\n But in determining present value, consideration must be given to prices and wages prevailing at the time of the investigation; and, in the light of all the circumstances, there must be an honest and intelligent forecast as to probable price and wage levels during a reasonable period in the immediate future. In every confiscation case, the future as well as the present must be regarded. It must be determined whether the rates complained of are yielding and will yield, over and above the amounts required to pay taxes and proper operating charges, a sum sufficient to constitute just compensation for the use of the property employed to furnish the service; that is, a reasonable rate of return on the value of the property at the \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 409]\n\u00a0\n time of the investigation and for a reasonable time in the immediate future. S. W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 288 S., 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807; Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 679, 692\n, 43 S. Ct. 675. Cf. Board of Utility Commissioners v. New York Telephone Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 31\n, 46 S. Ct. 363.\n The commission further said:\n'If it were known that the present price level would continue indefinitely in the future and that the purchasing power of the dollar would remain the same, then the cost of reproduction at the time of the inquiry would be the true measure of value. ... It is likely that there will be some reduction from the present price level . ... The value is being fixed, not for to-day, but for a reasonable period in the future. Consequently the reasonableness of the use of average prices is apparent. It is extremely doubtful if at any time within the next ten years prices will be as low as the prices used (those in the ten years ending with 1921), ... and it is equally certain that the average prices for the next, say, five years will be at least as high as the ten-year average used in this valuation. ... The iron and steel industries are enjoying greatly increased business and a general increase of about 20 per cent. in wages has been made. The increase in the wage scale has been reflected in the increased cost of iron pipe and other material. There seems to be no prospect of lower prices for such products. However much we may deplore the situation, the fact is that prices are on a permanently high level as compared with pre-war times and there is no likelihood whatever that a price level anywhere near approximating the low level of pre-war times will prevail for many years in the future.'\n\n The commission pointed out that enhancement of value 'may occur, first, when there is no change in the purchasing power of the dollar by reason of various circumstances such as the natural increment of land values in a growing city; and, second, by a decrease in the purchasing power or value of the dollar.' And it added: 'Both factors affect this property.' \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 410]\n\u00a0\n In explanation of the price levels used, the commission said:\n'By adopting the appraisal (the estimate of cost of reproduction less depreciation made by its own staff) on the basis of the average prices of labor and material for the ten-year period ending with 1921, the Commission recognizes the influence of the original cost factor. It is believed that the fair original cost of the physical property was from 12 to 20 per cent. less than the $14,904,000 used as a basis herein. On the other hand, the evidence shows that the cost of reproducing the physical property today would be from $4,500,000 to $ 5,000,000, or from 30 to 35 per cent. more than the said sum of $14, 904,000. ... There is no doubt that the element of original cost has been recognized sufficiently. There is doubt as to whether or not the element of the cost of reproduction new today has been given sufficient weight.'\n\n It is well established that values of utility properties fluctuate, and that owners must bear the decline and are entitled to the increase. The decision of this court in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 547\n, 18 S. Ct. 418, 434 (42 L. Ed. 819), declares that to ascertain value 'the present as compared with the original cost of construction' are, among other things, matters for consideration. But this does not mean that the original cost or the present cost or some figure arbitrarily chosen between these two is to be taken as the measure. The weight to be given to such cost figures and other items or classes of evidence is to be determined in the light of the facts of the case in hand. By far the greater part of the company's land and plant was acquired and constructed long before the war. The present value of the land is much greater than its cost; and the present cost of construction of those parts of the plant is much more than their reasonable original cost. In fact, prices and values have so changed that the amount paid for land in the early years of the enterprise and the cost of plant elements constructed prior to the great rise of prices due to \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 411]\n\u00a0\n the war do not constitute any real indication of their value at the present time. Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 157\n, 45 S. Ct. 465; Georgia Ry. v. R. R. Comm., \n262 U.S. 625\n, 630- 631, 43 S. Ct. 680; Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., supra, 691-692 (43 S. Ct. 675); S. W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., supra, 287 (43 S. Ct. 544). Undoubtedly, the reasonable cost of a system of waterworks, well-planned and efficient for the public service, is good evidence of its value at the time of construction. And such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as there is no change in the level of applicable prices. And, as indicated by the report of the commission, it is true that, if the tendency or trend of prices is not definitely upward or downward and it does not appear probable that there will be a substantial change of prices, then the present value of lands plus the present cost of constructing the plant, less depreciation, if any, is a fair measure of the value of the physical elements of the property.\n The validity of the rates in question depends on property value January 1, 1924, and for a reasonable time following. While the values of such properties do not vary with frequent minor fluctuations in the prices of material and labor required to produce them, they are affected by and generally follow the relatively permanent levels and trends of such prices. The fact that original cost was probably 12 to 20 per cent. less than the estimate of the commission's engineer based on the average of prices for the ten years ending with 1921-two years before the rate order became effective-does not tend to support the commission's adoption of that estimate. The cost of reproduction on price levels prevailing January 2, 1923, was found to be 30 to 35 per cent. or from $4,500,000 to $5,000,000 more. The average of prices in the ten years ending with 1923-the effective date of the rate order-was shown by the testimony of the commission's chief engineer to produce a result nearly 14 per cent. higher than the figure adopted; \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 412]\n\u00a0\n and, on the basis of prices prevailing on the effective date of the order, cost of reproduction less depreciation would be about 32 per cent. higher than that taken by the commission. The high level of prices and wages prevailing in 1922 and 1923 should be taken into account in finding value as of January 1, 1924, and in the years immediately following. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the prices prevailing at the effective date of the rate order were likely to decline within a reasonable time-one, two, or three years-to the level of the average in the ten years ending with 1923. And we may take judicial notice of the fact that there has been no substantial general decline in the prices of labor and materials since that time. The trend has been upward rather than downward. The price level adopted by the commission-the average for ten years ending with 1921-was too low. And it is clear that a level of prices higher than the average prevailing in the ten years ending with 1923 should be taken as the measure of value of the structural elements on and following the effective date of the rate order complained of.\n For working capital, the commission's chief engineer included $102, 997 to cover materials and supplies. He did not include anything to cover cash working capital. The commission adopted his total and added $135,000 for cash, making $237,997 in all. The testimony of the company's witnesses supports a higher figure, and there was no other evidence on the subject. The amount is low when compared with those included in other cases. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 400, 413]\n\u00a0\n The commission in No. 6613 discussed the company's water rights. It said:\n'Petitioner has acquired and now owns the right or privilege of taking and using all the water in White river and Fall creek for the purposes incident to its business. This right is an extraordinarily valuable part of the whole value of this property. The right to use the water of White river has saved the water company and likewise the citizens of Indianapolis millions of dollars over what it would have cost to secure sufficient water for the needs of the city in any other possible way. ... The water company is entitled to share in the benefit of this valuable possession by reason of the fact that by its foresight, ingenuity and initiative it has taken this stream of uncertain flow of impure water and has converted it into an immense asset both to itself and to the public. ... This whole plant ... has been planned and constructed with an ingenuity and economy and foresight for the future needs of the city that is unequalled under any similar circumstances anywhere in the country. Indianapolis is probably the most unfortunately situated of any large city so far as the natural available water is concerned, yet the possibilities of an insignificant stream flowing through a thickly populated countryside have been so thoroughly developed that Indianapolis now has, and if it doubles in population will have, an amply supply of potent ( potable) water at a cost much below the cost in many other cities more favorably located. This development of its water rights, which has been accomplished by the water company at times with extreme difficulty, does actually largely increase the value of the property.'\n\n The value of these water rights must be included. San Joaquin Co. v. Stanislaus County, \n233 \nU.S. 454, 459\n, 34 S. Ct. 652\n\n\n The report further stated:\n'A good property has an intangible value or going concern value over and above the value of the component parts of the physical property. \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 414]\n\u00a0\n ... Any reasonable man with a knowledge of this property and the local conditions would unhesitatingly affirm that it had a value far in excess of the value of the pipe, buildings, grounds and machinery. Consider its earning power with low rates, the business it has attached, its fine public relations, its credit, the nature of the city and the certainty of large future growth, the way the property is planned and is being extended with the future needs of the city in view, its operating efficiency and standard of maintenance, its desirability as compared with similar properties in other cities and with other utilities of comparable size in this city. These things make up an element of value that is actual and not speculative. It would be considered by a buyer or seller of the property or by a buyer or seller of its securities.'\n\n The decisions of this court declare:\n'That there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money, over one not thus advanced, is self-evident. This element of value is a property right, and should be considered in determining the value of the property, upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return when the same is privately owned although dedicated to public use.' Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S. Ct. 811; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 191\n, 192 S., 38 S. Ct. 278.\n\n And see National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 62 F. 853, 865, 10 C. C. A. 653, 27 L. R. A. 827; Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., \n218 \nU.S. 180, 202\n, 203 S., 30 S. Ct. 615, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1084, and cases cited.\n The commission January 2, 1923, in No. 6613 included $1,416,000, being 9.5 per cent. of the amount attributed to the physical elements, to cover water rights and going value. November 28, 1923, in No. 7080, it included only $980,000 to cover working capital, water rights and going value. There is no specification of the amount assigned to each. It stated that the amount was a smaller percentage of the value of the physical property than is \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 415]\n\u00a0\n usually allowed in such cases. There is nothing in the record to justify the reduction. Deducting $135,000 for cash working capital, the amount included for water rights and going value is less than six per cent. of the value of the physical elements as fixed by it. Having regard to the character of the system, that amount is clearly too low. The valuation engineers called by the company appraised water rights and going value separately. Each fixed the value of water rights at $500,000, and one put going value at $2,000,000, and the other at a slightly higher figure. The commission's engineer made no appraisal of water rights or going value. The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain 9.5 per cent. for going value. And the reported cases showing amounts generally included by commissions and courts to cover intangible elements of value indicate that 10 per cent. of the value of the physical elements would be low when the impressive facts reported by the commission in this case are taken into account. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The commission and the city submit the same brief. Some of their contentions are opposed to the commission's findings above referred to. They support an estimate or appraisal made by Walter S. Bemis, an engineer \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 416]\n\u00a0\n called by the city. He reported that, as of December 31, 1923, the cost of reproduction new was $12,216,508.05 and that less depreciation $9,220,214. 18. The estimate is based on 'ten-year average prices from 1911 to 1920.' It gives no consideration to the prices prevailing in the three years preceding the effective date of the order. The price basis is substantially lower than the average for ten years ending 1923. There is deducted approximately 25 per cent. of estimated cost new to cover accrued depreciation. The deduction was not based on an inspection of the property. It was the result of a 'straight line' calculation based on age and the estimated or assumed useful life of perishable elements. The commission's report indicates that the property is well-planned, well-maintained, and efficient. Its chief engineer inspected it, and estimated its condition by giving effect to results of the examination and to the age of the property. He deducted about 6 per cent. to cover depreciation. Mr. Hagenah made an estimate of existing depreciation based on actual inspection and a consideration of the probable future life as indicated by the conditions found. He deducted less than 6 per cent. Mr. Elmes testified that he made an inspection and estimate of all the actual depreciation. He estimated $ 443,044 would be required to restore the property as of appraisal date to its condition when first installed and put in practical operation. He deducted that amount.\n The testimony of competent valuation engineers who examined the property and made estimates in respect of its condition is to be preferred to mere calculations based on averages and assumed probabilities. The deduction made in the city's estimate cannot be approved. Pacific Gas Co. v. San Francisco, \n265 \nU.S. 403, 406\n, 44 S. Ct. 537; Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pacific Co., supra, 159 (45 S. Ct. 465); Landon v. Court of Industrial Relations (D. C.) 269 F. 433, 445; City of Winona v. Wisconsin-Minnesota Light & P. Co. (D. C.) 276 F. 996, 1004; New York Telephone \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 417]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Prendergast (D. C.) 300 F. 822, 826; Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Railroad Commission (D. C.) 5 F.(2d) 77, 95.\n The company owns a canal in which water flows from the river to filter beds and to a power plant below them, where that not taken for filtration is used to pump water into the mains for distribution. The estimate of Mr. Bemis for the city eliminates the lower part of the canal and suggests the substitution of a steam plant. This reduces cost of reproduction new by $1,073,539.6o and that less depreciation by $785,013. 11. The whole canal was included in the estimate of Mr. Carter which was adopted. The commission in its report in No. 7080 described the canal and the uses to which it is put including the production of power for pumping, and said: 'This shows the work of a competent construction engineer.' And in No. 6613, the commission said:\n'The canal appears to have been perfectly adapted to become a part of the water plant of the city. It intercepts the waters of White river near Broad ripple. This is so far upstream that the source of supply has been free from the contamination arising from densely settled districts of the city for nearly half a century. ... It saves the lift of millions of gallons of water daily from White river to the level of the filter beds. ... The economic value of the canal is very large, when regard is given to the savings it effects, and the revenue it produces. ... Its great value lies in the fact that it has never failed to do efficiently the work that must be done by some instrumentality of the water plant. The cost of a steel or concrete main or conduit, that would carry a far less quantity of water, would exceed the cost of reconstruction of the canal, and its structural parts. The entire canal property is used and useful in the performance of the service this utility was created to perform.'\n\n There is to be ascertained the value of the plant used to give the service and not the estimated cost a different \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 418]\n\u00a0\n plant. Save under exceptional circumstances, the court is not required to enter upon a comparison of the merits of different systems. Such an inquiry would lead to collateral issues and investigations having only remote bearing on the fact to be found, viz. the value of the property devoted to the service of the public.\n The estimate made for the city is not useful as a guide for ascertainment of value of the company's property for 1924.\n For convenient comparison, there follows a statement of the estimates based on prices prevailing January 1, 1924, and those based on average prices in the ten years ending with 1923.\n Spot Prices. Average Prices. Carter $19,500,000 $17,000,000 Hagenah and Erickson 22,669,000 19,624,000 Sanderson and Porter 21,898,000 18,931,000\n While some expressions of the district judge indicate that he was of opinion that dominant or controlling weight should be given to cost of reproduction less depreciation estimated on spot prices as of January 1, 1924, it is clear that the $19,000,000, fixed by him as the minimum value could not have been arrived at on that basis. The commission's chief engineer testified that his estimate on prices as of that date was $19,500, 000. This was exclusive of cash working capital, water rights and going value for which Hagenah and Erickson included $2,735,000 and Sanderson and Porter $2,961,245. But the commission in No. 6613 added $135,000 for such working capital. It also added 9.5 per cent. of the value of the physical elements to cover water rights and going value, amounting to $1,416,000. If only these additions be made to Mr. Carter's spot price estimate, there is produced $21,051,000. And, if 9,5 per cent. of $19,500,000 were taken to cover water rights and going value, the total would exceed $21,487,000. Moreover, the estimates on the basis of \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 419]\n\u00a0\n spot prices introduced by the company are considerably higher than Mr. Carter's figure.\n The commission November 28, 1923, in No. 7080 found 7 per cent. to be a reasonable rate of return. It stated that was the rate the city's appraiser, Mr. E. W. Bemis, testified to be reasonable. At the trial, the company introduced testimony supporting higher rates. Mr. Hagenah and Mr. Elmes testified that 8 per cent. was a reasonable rate of return. Mr. Metcalf, consulting engineer for the company, supported a rate from 7.5 per cent. to 8 per cent. Appellants offered a study by Mr. E. W. Bemis of the rates of yield to investors on certain public utility bonds. He took into account 524 flotations put out at different times between July, 1921, and February, 1924, inclusive. The average yield in the last six months of 1921 was 7.33 per cent. and in February, 1924, 6.11 per cent. The trend was not downward throughout the whole period. It was upward from the last half of 1922 through all of 1923. And he testified that there should be added .4 of 1 per cent. to cover brokerage. It is obvious that rates of yield on investments in bonds plus brokerage is substantially less than the rate of return required to constitute just compensation for the use of properties in the public service. Bonds rarely constitute the source of all the money required to finance public utilities. And investors insist on higher yields on stock than current rates of interest on bonds. Obviously, the cost of money to finance the whole enterprise is not measured by interest rates plus brokerage on bonds floated for only a part of the investment. The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the rate of 7 per cent. found by the commission. And recent decisions support a higher rate of return. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 400, 420]\n\u00a0\n There was controversy as to probable net earnings for 1924. The company's estimate is $958,000; the city's, $1,121,550.19. The principal difference arises from the city's contention that the company's estimate of revenue was too low by $67,758.92 and of operating expenses was too high by $95,791.27.\n While the facts stated in the court's decision are sufficient to sustain the decree, the findings as to value, the reasonable rate of return, and the net earnings are not as specific as good practice requires. As the litigation would be prolonged considerably if the case were remanded for further findings, we have examined the record to determine whether the facts proved justify the court's conclusion. Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 29 S. Ct. 148; Chicago M. & St. P. Ry. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 179\n, 20 S. Ct. 336; Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n223 \nU.S. 349, 361\n, 32 S. Ct. 271; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., supra, 182 (38 S. Ct. 278); Cole v. Ralph, \n252 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 40 S. Ct. 321.\n And we are satisfied that the decree is right. As indicated above, a reasonable rate of return is not less than 7 per cent. In his decision the district judge plainly intimated that he was of opinion that probable net earnings for 1924 were not sufficient to pay more than 5 per cent. on $19, 000,000. The amount of net earnings in 1924, as estimated by appellants, is only sufficient to pay 7 per cent. on $16,022,145. The evidence requires a finding that, exclusive of the items classified by Mr. Carter as nonoperative, the value of the property is much more than that amount. It is shown that, if due consideration be given to the price level and trend prevailing \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 421]\n\u00a0\n in the years immediately before and those probable during a reasonable time following the effective date of the order, January 1, 1924, the $17, 000,000 estimated by Mr. Carter on the basis of average prices in the ten years ending with 1923 is substantially less than the amount fairly attributable to the physical elements of the property. The evidence sustains an amount in excess of 10 per cent. to cover water rights and going value and also $135,000 for cash working capital. On a consideration of the evidence, it is held that the value of the property as of January 1, 1924, and immediately following was not less than $19,000,000.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n In the case at bar, as in Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388\n, 42 S. Ct. 351, and Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625\n, 43 S. Ct. 680, L. Ed. 1144, both the rate-making body and the lower court purported to adopt the rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S. Ct. 418, by which the value of the property, as of the time of the rate hearing, is taken as the rate base. Hence, the soundness of that rule-the question on which this court divided in Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807, and in Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. San Francisco, \n265 \nU.S. 403\n, 44 S. Ct. 537-is not involved here. Nor is the general question involved on which the court divided in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 40 S. Ct. 527.\n The commission and the lower court likewise agreed that reproduction cost was evidence as to value. The primary questions on which they differed are these. Is a finding of reproduction cost tantamount to a finding of value? Is the reproduction cost which should be ascertained by the tribunal, the 'spot' reproduction cost-that is, cost at prices prevailing at the time of the hearing? \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 422]\n\u00a0\n The District Court, as I read its opinion, answered both of these questions in the affirmative. \n5\n The learned judge assumed that spot reproduction cost is the legal equivalent of value. He found that $19,000, 000 was, on the evidence, the lowest conceivable spot reproduction cost. He assumed that, since the utility was willing to accept this minimum as reproduction cost, no amount less than that could be found by him to be the value, or rate base. He believed that recent decisions of this court required him so to hold. In this belief he was clearly in error.\n That reproduction cost is not conclusive evidence of value has been repeatedly stated by a unanimous court. The rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 547\n, 18 S. Ct. 418, 434 (42 L. Ed. 819) required not only that each class of other evidence of value be considered, but also that each class of evidence 'be given such weight as may be just and right in each case.' \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 423]\n\u00a0\n Similarly, it was stated in the Georgia Railway & Power Case, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 630\n, 43 S. Ct. 680, 681 (67 L. Ed. 1144):\n'The refusal of the commission and of the lower court to hold that, for rate-making purposes, the physical properties of a utility must be valued at the replacement cost less depreciation was clearly correct. As was said in Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 434 (33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (M. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18): 'The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.\"\n\n There is, so far as I recall, no statement by this court that value is tantamount to reproduction cost.\n Nor do I find in the decisions of this court any support for the view that a peculiar sanction attaches to 'spot' reproduction cost, as distinguished from the amount that it would actually cost to reproduce the plant if that task were undertaken at the date of the hearing. 'Spot' reproduction would be impossible of accomplishment with- \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 424]\n\u00a0\n out the aid of Aladdin's lamp. The actual cost of a plant may conceivably indicate its actual value at the time of completion or at some time thereafter. Estimates of cost may conceivably approximate what the cost of reproduction would be at a given time. But, where a plant would require years for completion, the estimate would be necessarily delusive, if it were based on 'spot' prices of labor, materials, and money. The estimate, to be in any way worthy of trust, must be based on a consideration of the varying costs of labor, materials, and money for a period at least as long as would be required to construct the plant and put it into operation. Moreover, the estimate must be made in the light of a longer experience, and with due allowances for the hazards which attend all prophecies in respect to prices. The search for value can hardly be aided by a hypothetical estimate of the cost of replacing the plant at a particular moment, when actual reproduction would require a period that must be measured by years.\n When a court declares that the rate base shall be the value, instead of the historical cost, or the amount prudently invested in the enterprise, it selects the standard for measuring the property on which compensation is to be paid. It lays down a rule of law, and in the performance of that function there is always a legitimate field for theory. But when, having selected value as the standard for the rate base, the court undertakes to find what that value is at the date of the rate hearing, it purports to make a finding of fact. The process of determining facts will inevitably be misleading, unless each step bears a close relation to the realities of life.\n The evidence introduced before the trial court, which seems to be in substance the same as that introduced before the commission, is now before this court. We have power to examine the evidence and to enter such decree as may be appropriate. Compare Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178\n, 38 S. Ct. 278. But the better practice \n\n[272 U.S. 400, 425]\n\u00a0\n requires that the case be remanded to the District Court, so that the evidence may be re-examined there in the light of the applicable rules. Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 43 S. Ct. 353; Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196\n, 44 S. Ct. 553. Compare Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 179\n, 20 S. Ct. 336; Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 30 S. Ct. 505; Brown v. Fletcher, \n237 \nU.S. 583\n, 35 S. Ct. 750; Gerdes v. Lustgarten, \n266 \nU.S. 321, 327\n, 45 S. Ct. 107. To this end the decree should, in my opinion, be reversed.\n To avoid the possibility of misunderstanding I add merely that in my opinion the facts of record, considered in connection with those of which we have judicial notice, do not justify holding that rates which yield a return of less than 7 per cent. would be so unreasonably low as to be confiscatory.\n Mr. Justice STONE joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This includes $648,921 estimated by Mr. Carter to cover items of property classified by him as nonoperative.

Ct. 680) were decided at a time when the court had, as a matter of history in this particular field of jurisprudence, full cognizance of the probative character and the propriety of considering evidence such as is popularly called evidence of historical cost, evidence of reproduction cost upon a certain price level, evidence of value which is called prudent in vestment value, and, fourth, evidence of what is strictly and technically reproduction spot depreciated at the time of the inquiry, these cases press upon us sharply the query of why these cases, in their results, disclose the emphasis given to the last-named of these four characters of evidence, and I am entirely content to accept the characterization made by the judges in the sixth circuit in the so-called Monroe Gas Case; that the necessary implication from their results is that dominating consideration should be given to evidence of reproduction value, and, if that means anything, it means that evidence of reproduction value spot at the time of the inquiry must be considered as evidence of a primarily different character from either of the other three kinds of evidence. ... Now the court is required, as it seems to me, to apply the principles that are to be discussed and to be accepted, as I indicated in my preliminary remarks, as to what the Supreme Court meant by what it said in these three cases. Is it possible, ... or can the court now rationally say, that the commission here, and, in order to test it out, include the court here, can, by any sort of examination of the evidence, reach a conclusion that upon unimpeached evidence showing a minimum of spot reproduction values at $19, 000,000, it will still find reasonable value at $15,260,000? ... Now that brings us to the evidence in this case, and, as I said, can the commission, or can this court now, say that there can be a rational reconcilement between unimpeached evidence of $19,000,000, as a minimum cost reproduction value spot, and any other price level, particularly one showing a disparity of $5,000,000-$4,000,000 to $5,000,000? ... I am not confronted with the problem of fixing a valuation within the range of dispute upon spot reproduction. I say I am not confronted with that problem, because the complainant comes into this court and offers to accept $19,000,000 as a fair basis of valuation, even though, as it says, and I think has reason to say, and could support it, it could, upon the record, sustain a higher valuation.' The decree itself recited 'that the fair value of complainants' said property was and is not less than $19,000, 000.' \n\n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMELLON v. MICHIGAN TRUST CO.(1926)\nNo. 272\nArgued: April 27, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Sidney F. Andrews, of Washington, D. C., A. A. McLaughlin, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Leorge M. Clapperton and Charles M. Owen, both of Grand Rapids, Mich., for appellant. \n\n[271 U.S. 236, 237]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. E. Knappen, of Grand Rapids, Mich. (Knappen, Uhl & Bryant, of Grand Rapids, Mich., of counsel), for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Creditors of the Rathbone Manufacturing Company filed a bill against it in the United States District Court, Western District of Michigan, wherein they alleged its inability to pay lawful debts in due course, etc., and asked for a receiver. Answering, the corporation (which was, in fact, insolvent) admitted the allegations and gave consent to the relief prayed. Thereupon the Michigan Trust Company was appointed receiver, took possession of the property and entered upon administration of the trust.\n The Director General of Railroads presented claims for transportation charges and conversion of a shipment of pig iron. He asked priority of payment, which was denied by both the trial court and the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 F. (2d) 194.\n As pointed out in United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corporation, \n269 \nU.S. 504\n, 46 S. Ct. 179 (January 11, 1926), the things done by the Rathbone Manufacturing Company amounted, in substance, to a voluntary assignment of all its property within the meaning of R. S.  3466 (Comp. St. s6372)1. Consequently, if the Director \n\n[271 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n General is entitled to the priority granted to the United States by that section, the judgment below must be reversed. But it is said here, and was held below, that such priority is inhibited by the provisions of section 10, Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 456 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j), which provides:\n'That carriers while under federal control shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under state or federal laws or at common law, except in so far as may be inconsistent with the provisions of this act or any other act applicable to such federal control or with any order of the President. Actions at law or suits in equity may be brought by and against such carriers and judgments rendered as now provided by law; and in any action at law or suit in equity against the carrier, no defense shall be made thereto upon the ground that the carrier is an instrumentality or agency of the federal government. Nor shall any such carrier be entitled to have transferred to a federal court any action heretofore or hereafter instituted by or against it, which action was not so transferable prior to the federal control of such carrier; and any action which has heretofore been so transferred because of such federal control or of any act of Congress or official order or proclamation relating thereto shall upon motion of either party be retransferred to the court in which it was originally instituted. But no process, mesne or final, shall be levied against any property under such federal control.'\n\n Under Davis v. Pringle, \n268 \nU.S. 315\n, 45 S. Ct. 549, if the estate of the Rathbone Manufacturing Company were being ad- \n\n[271 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n ministered under the Bankruptcy Act, the claims of the Director General would not be entitled to preference. It is also plain, under Bramwell v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n269 \nU.S. 483\n, 46 S. Ct. 176, Price, Receiver, v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492\n, 46 S. Ct. 180, and United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corporation, supra ( January 11, 1926), that, in proceedings like the present one, debts due directly to the United States, nothing else appearing, are ordinarily entitled to priority under R. S.  3466. Decision of this cause, therefore, must turn upon the effect to be given section 10, Act of 1918, supra.\n All agree that the rights of the Director General rest upon statutory provisions, and not upon any sovereign prerogative of the United States. In taking over and operating the railroads, the United States acted in their sovereign capacity. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 456, 462\n, 44 S. Ct. 364. But it was for Congress to determine whether or not claims arising out of such operation should have priority when the debtor made a voluntary assignment. In cases of bankruptcy the statute then in force prohibited any preference.\n In some matters, at least, under section 10, the United States stand exactly as if they were a railroad corporation operating as a common carrier. Director General v. Kastenbaum, \n263 \nU.S. 25, 28\n, 44 S. Ct. 52. As said in Davis v. Pullen (C. C. A.) 277 F. 650, 655:\n'There is a certain obvious injustice in giving the United States when engaged in an industrial and commercial venture, even although under war powers, superior rights over other creditors bearing like relations to insolvents.'\n\n And we think that the indicated purpose of Congress will be best carried out by construing the relevant statutes, so far as may be, with the general intent to preserve the substantive rights of all parties concerned as they would have existed but for federal control.\n Section 10 subjected the Director General, as an operator of common carriers, to the laws theretofore applicable \n\n[271 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n to them, except when inconsistent with some provision of the federal control acts or an order of the President, and forbade him to defend, in any suit against him as such operator, upon the ground that he was an instrumentality or agency of the federal government. In the circumstances presented by this record, it is reasonable to say that the statute confined his substantive rights to those which a carrier would have had, and prohibits him, as though he were an actual defendant in a suit, from resisting the demands of others for equal distribution of the insolvent's assets, under the commonly applied rule, upon the ground that he is an instrumentality of the federal government. To permit the claimed preference, we think, would conflict with the spirit and broad purpose of the statute. These become plain enough upon consideration of the just ends which Congress had in view together with the recent policy, revealed by the Bankruptcy Act, in respect of priorities.\n The cause is properly here on the writ of certiorari. The appeal was improvidently allowed by the Circuit Judge, and is dismissed.\n The decree below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed. \n\n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMELLON v.

Keith, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In November, 1918, while the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad was under federal control, a bale of rags was received for shipment to Louis Cutler, the owner. The reasonable time for delivery expired in December, 1918. The rags were never delivered. Cutler assigned his claim for damages to Nominsky. In May, 1919, the latter commenced this action thereon in a state court of Massachusetts. Because he named the railroad company as sole defendant, the action was dismissed by the trial court. In June, 1921, that judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court. Nominsky v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co., 132 N. E. 30, 239 Mass. 254. See Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, 41 S. Ct. 593, \n256 U.S. 554\n. In January, 1922, the writ and declaration were, by leave of the trial court, amended under section 206(a), Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 10071 1\/4 cc), by substituting as defendant Davis, Agent and Director General. The summons was immediately served upon him. Later Nominsky died. Weiss, his administrator, was substituted as plaintiff.\n Davis, appearing specially to object to the jurisdiction of the court over him, asked that the suit be dismissed. Without waiving that objection, he asked for judgment upon the following among other grounds: The shipment \n\n[270 U.S. 565, 567]\n\u00a0\n had been made on an order bill of lading which provided that:\n'Suits for loss, damage, or delay shall be instituted only within two years and one day after delivery of the property, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed.'\n\n Davis claimed that, although the substitution of him as defendant was made within two years from the termination of federal control, the action was barred by the bill of lading, because the substitution was not made until after two years and one day from the lapse of the reasonable time for delivery. The objection was overruled by the trial court, and it entered judgment for the plaintiff. The appellate division ordered judgment for the defendant. The Supreme Judicial Court reversed that order and directed the trial court to enter judgment for the plaintiff. Weiss v. Director General of Railroads, 144 N. E. 765, 250 Mass. 12. This court granted a writ of certiorari (45 S. Ct. 229, \n267 U.S. 588\n) on January 26, 1925\n\n\n Since then, Davis v. L. L. Cohen & Co., Inc., 45 S. Ct. 633, \n268 \nU.S. 638, 640\n, 642 S., has settled that a suit against a railroad company is not a suit against the Director General; that section 206(d) of Transportation Act of 1920 authorized substitution of the designated Agent as defendant only in a suit which had been brought during federal control against the Director General, and that in a suit against a railroad company pending at the termination of federal control an amendment of the writ and declaration by substituting as defendant the designated Agent is to be deemed the commencement of a new and independent proceeding to enforce the liability of the government. Applying that rule, there was in the case at bar no suit to enforce the government's liability pending at the termination of federal control. The order substituting the Agent was not made until more than two years and a day after the cause of action arose; and as such an order of substitution is held to be the commencement of a new and independent \n\n[270 U.S. 565, 568]\n\u00a0\n proceeding, it follows that the suit is barred by the terms of the bill of lading.\n Other objections made by the defendant to the action of the state court need not be considered.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMETCALF & EDDY v.

Assistant Attorney General Letts and Robert P. Reeder, of Washington, D. C., for Mitchell's administratrix.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Metcalf & Eddy, the plaintiffs below, were consulting engineers who, either individually or as copartners, were professionally employed to advise states or subdivisions of states with reference to proposed water supply and sewage disposal systems. During 1917 the fees received by them for these services were paid over to the firm and became a part of its gross income. Upon this portion of their net income they paid, under protest, the tax assessed on the net income of copartnerships under the War Revenue Act of 1917. Act Oct. 3, 1917, c. 63,  209, 40 Stat. 300, 307. They then brought suit in the United States District Court for Massachusetts to recover the tax paid on the items in question, on the ground that they were expressly exempted from the tax by the act itself, and on the further ground that Congress had no power under the Constitution to tax the income in question.\n The District Court found that 2 of the items were within the statutory exemption; that the remaining 18 were not exempt from taxation, either by the provisions of the statute or under the Constitution, and entered judgment accordingly. 299 F. 812.\n The former collector sued out the writ of error in No. 376 as to the two items on which a recovery was allowed. In No. 183 the writ of error is prosecuted by the plaintiffs below as to the remaining items. Judicial Code,  238 (Comp. St.  1215), before amendment of 1925\n\n\n As the case comes directly from the District Court to this court on a constitutional question, the jurisdiction \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 519]\n\u00a0\n of this court is not limited to that question alone, but extends to the whole case. Horner v. United States, No. 2, \n143 \nU.S. 570\n, 12 S. Ct. 522; Greene v. Louisville, etc., R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88.\n All of the items of income were received by the taxpayers as compensation for their services as consulting engineers under contracts with states or municipalities, or water or sewage districts created by state statute. In each case the service was rendered in connection with a particular project for water supply or sewage disposal, and the compensation was paid in some instances on an annual basis, in others on a monthly or daily basis, and in still others on the basis of a gross sum for the whole service.\n The War Revenue Act provided for the assessment of a tax on net income; but section 201(a), being 40 Stat. 303, contains a provision for exemption from the tax as follows:\n'This title shall apply to all trades or businesses of whatever description, whether continuously carried on or not, except-\n\n'(a) In the case of officers and employees under the United States, or any state, territory, or the District of Columbia, or any local subdivision thereof, the compensation or fees received by them as such officers or employees. ...'\n\n The court found that the two items of income involved in No. 376 were received by one of the plaintiffs in error as compensation for his services as the incumbent of an office created by statute; in one case as chief engineer of the Kennebec water district, a political subdivision of the state of Maine, and in the other as a member of the board of engineers of the North Shore sanitary district, a political subdivision of the state of Illinois. The collector does not press his writ of error in this case, and we therefore dismiss the writ.\n We think it clear that neither of the plaintiffs in error occupied any official position in any of the undertakings \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 520]\n\u00a0\n to which their writ of error in No. 183 relates. They took no oath of office; they were free to accept any other concurrent employment; none of their engagements was for work of a permanent or continuous character; some were of brief duration, and some from year to year, others for the duration of the particular work undertaken. Their duties were prescribed by their contracts and it does not appear to what extent, if at all, they were defined or prescribed by statute. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs in error have failed to sustain the burden cast upon them of establishing that they were officers of a state or a subdivision of a state within the exception of section 201(a).\n An office is a public station conferred by the appointment of government. The term embraces the idea of tenure, duration, emolument and duties fixed by law. Where an office is created, the law usually fixes its incidents, including its terms, its duties and its compensation. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385; Hall v. Wisconsin, \n103 U.S. 5\n. The term 'officer' is one inseparably connected with an office; but there was no office of sewage or water supply expert or sanitary engineer, to which either of the plaintiffs was appointed. The contracts with them, although entered into by authority of law and prescribing their duties, could not operate to create an office or give to plaintiffs the status of officers. Hall v. Wisconsin, supra; Auffmordt v. Hedden, \n137 \nU.S. 310\n, 11 S. Ct. 103. There were lacking in each instance the essential elements of a public station, permanent in character, created by law, whose incidents and duties were prescribed by law. See United States v. Maurice, Fed. Cas. No. 15,747, 2 Brock. 96, 102, 103; United States v. Germaine, \n99 \nU.S. 508, 511\n, 512 S.; Adams v. Murphy, 165 F. 304, 91 C. C. A. 272.\n Nor do the facts stated in the bill of exceptions establish that the plaintiffs were 'employees' within the meaning of the statute. So far as appears, they were in the position of independent contractors. The record does \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 521]\n\u00a0\n not reveal to what extent, if at all, their services were subject to the direction or control of the public boards or officers engaging them. In each instance the performance of their contract involved the use of judgment and discretion on their part and they were required to use their best professional skill to bring about the desired result. This permitted to them liberty of action which excludes the idea that control or right of control by the employer which characterizes the relation of employer and employee and differentiates the employee or servant from the independent contractor.

Ct. 175.\n We pass to the more difficult question whether Congress had the constitutional power to impose the tax in question, and this must be answered by ascertaining whether its effect is such as to bring it within the purview of those decisions holding that the very nature of our constitutional system of dual sovereign governments is such as impliedly to prohibit the federal government from taxing the instrumentalities of a state government, and in a similar manner to limit the power of the states to tax the instrumentalities of the federal government.

Ct. 171.\n Just what instrumentalities of either a state or the federal government are exempt from taxation by the other cannot be stated in terms of universal application. But this court has repeatedly held that those agencies through which either government immediately and directly exercises its sovereign powers, are immune from the taxing power of the other. Thus the employment of officers who are agents to administer its laws (Collector v. Day; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, supra), its obligations sold to raise public funds (Weston v. City Council of Charleston, supra; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra), its investments of public funds in the securities of private corporations, for public purposes (United States v. Railroad Co., supra), surety bonds exacted by it in the exercise of its police power (Ambrosini v. United States, supra), are all so intimately connected with the necessary functions of government, as to fall within the established exemption; and when the instrumentality is of that character, the immunity extends not only to the instrumentality itself but to income derived from it (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra), and forbids an occupation tax imposed on its use (Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra). And see Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, supra.\n When, however, the question is approached from the other end of the scale, it is apparent that not every person who uses his property or derives a profit, in his dealings with the government, may clothe himself with immunity from taxation on the theory that either he or his \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 523]\n\u00a0\n property is an instrumentality of government within the meaning of the rule. Thompson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579; Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5; Baltimore Shippbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 50; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362, 371\n, 32 S. Ct. 499; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n240 \nU.S. 319\n, 36 S. Ct. 298; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531\n, 41 S. Ct. 582.\n As cases arise, lying between the two extremes, it becomes necessary to draw the line which separates those activities having some relation to government, which are nevertheless subject to taxation, from those which are immune. Experience has shown that there is no formula by which that line may be plotted with precision in advance. But recourse may be had to the reason upon which the rule rests, and which must be the guiding principle to control its operation. Its origin was due to the essential requirement of our constitutional system that the federal government must exercise its authority within the territorial limits of the states; and it rests on the conviction that each government in order that it may administer its affairs within its own sphere, must be left free from undue interference by the other. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra; Collector v. Day, supra; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, supra.\n In a broad sense, the taxing power of either government, even when exercised in a manner admittedly necessary and proper, unavoidably has some effect upon the other. The burden of federal taxation necessarily sets an economic limit to the practical operation of the taxing power of the states, and vice versa. Taxation by either the state or the federal government affects in some measure the cost of operation of the other.\n But neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers. Hence the limitation upon the taxing power of each, so far as it affects the other, must receive a practi- \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 524]\n\u00a0\n cal construction which permits both to function with the minimum of interference each with the other; and that limitation cannot be so varied or extended as seriously to impair either the taxing power of the government imposing the tax (South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 461\n, 26 S. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, at page 172 (31 S. Ct. 342)) or the appropriate exercise of the functions of the government affected by it (Railroad Co. v. Peniston, supra, 31).\n While it is evident that in one aspect the extent of the exemption must finally depend upon the effect of the tax upon the functions of the government alleged to be effected by it, still the nature of the governmental agencies or the mode of their constitution may not be disregarded in passing on the question of tax exemption; for it is obvious that an agency may be of such a character or so intimately connected with the exercise of a power of the performance of a duty by the one government, that any taxation of it by the other would be such a direct interference with the functions of government itself as to be plainly beyond the taxing power.\n It is on this principle that, as we have see, any taxation by one government of the salary of an officer of the other, or the public securities of the other, or an agency created and controlled by the other, exclusively to enable it to perform a governmental function (Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra), is prohibited. But here the tax is imposed on the income of one who is neither an officer nor an employee of government and whose only relation to it is that of contract, under which there is an obligation to furnish service, for practical purposes not unlike a contract to sell and deliver a commodity. The tax is imposed without discrimination upon income whether derived from services rendered to the state or services rendered to private individuals. In such a situation it cannot be said that the tax is imposed upon an agency of government in any technical sense, and the tax itself cannot be deemed \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 525]\n\u00a0\n to be an interference with government, or an impairment of the efficiency of its agencies in any substantial way. Railroad Co. v. Peniston; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co.; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. Co. v. Mackey, supra.\n As was said by this court in Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, supra (in holding that a state might tax the interest of a corporation in a dry dock which the United States had the right to use under a contract entered into with the corporation):\n'It seems to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a state, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person, or its property, because it is employed by the United States, even if the work for which it is employed is important and takes much of its time.' Page 382 (25 S. Ct. 52).\n\n And as was said in Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, in holding valid a state tax on premiums collected by bonding insurance companies on surety bonds required by United States officials:\n'But mere contracts between private corporations and the United States do not necessarily render the former essential government agencies and confer freedom from state control.' Page 323 (36 S. Ct. 300).\n\n These statement we deem to be equally applicable to private citizens engaged in the general practice of a profession or the conduct of a business in the course of which they enter into contracts with government from which they derive a profit. We do not suggest that there may not be interferences with such a contract relationship by means other than taxation which are prohibited. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, supra, at page 36, recognizes that there may. Nor are we to be understood as laying down any rule that taxation might not affect agencies of this character in such a manner as directly to interfere with the \n\n[269 U.S. 514, 526]\n\u00a0\n functions of government and thus be held to be void. See Railroad v. Peniston, supra, at page 36; Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, supra, at page 522; Choctaw, O & Gulf Railway Co. v. Harrison, supra, at page 272.\n But we do decide that one who is not an officer or employee of a state, does not establish exemption from federal income tax merely by showing that his income was received as compensation for service rendered under a contract with the state; and when we take the next step necessary to a complete disposition of the question, and inquire into the effect of the particular tax, on the functioning of the state government, we do not find that it impairs in any substantial manner the ability of plaintiffs in error to discharge their obligations to the state or the ability of a state or its subdivisions to procure the services of private individuals to aid them in their undertakings. Cf. Central Pacific Railroad v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91, 126\n, 16 S. Ct. 766.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 251, 252]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. C. Calhoun, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On August 12, 1907, the Midland Land & Improvement Company agreed with the United States to dredge and dispose of 4,177,110 cubic yards of material in Newark Bay and Passaic river at 16 1\/4 cents per yard, payable as the work progressed. The contract provided that the work should be prosecuted with 'faithfulness and energy,' and that the rate of work 'will be at least 50,000 cubic yards per month.' On September 24, 1912, the company stopped work, leaving much unperformed. In 1913, the government declared the contract 'annulled,' and had the uncompleted part of the work done by another contractor, who was paid 26.7 cents per yard. See United States v. O'Brien, 31 S. Ct. 406, \n220 U.S. 321\n, 328. The additional cost to the government was $141,127.31. The Midland contract provided that the government would reserve from each payment 10 per cent. until half of the work was completed, and that the amount reserved might be applied toward reimbursing it for any additional cost resulting from the contractor's default. The sum of $33,998.15, which had been reserved, was so applied. In 1917, the company brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. Upon elaborate findings \n\n[270 U.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n of fact that court entered judgment for the United States. 58 Ct. Cl. 671. The case is here on appeal, taken May 15, 1924, under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1219).\n It is contended that, at the time when the government annulled the contract, the amount of work done had exceeded the aggregate of the monthly requirements, and hence that the company was not in default. This question we have no occasion to consider. The correspondence between the parties and other facts found warranted the conclusion that the company had abandoned the work and refused to complete the contract. There was thus an anticipatory breach by the company, which entitled the government to relet the uncompleted part of the work. Compare Smoot's Case, 15 Wall. 36, 48; Dingley v. Oler, 6 S. Ct. 850, \n117 U.S. 490\n, 503. It is also contended that the judgment is erroneous, because it was incumbent upon the government to show that the uncompleted work done under the later contract did not materially depart from that described in the repudiated contract, and that this was not shown. See United States v. Axman, 34 S. Ct. 736, \n234 U.S. 36\n. The lower court concluded that the uncompleted part of the work was relet on the same specifications. Enough appears to show that the loss to the government resulting from the plaintiff's repudiation of the contract far exceeded the amount reserved.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILLERS' INDEMNITY UNDERWRITERS v.

Adams, of Beaumont, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 59, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below affirmed a judgment of the Orange county district court in favor of defendant in error for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Texas (Gen. Laws 1917, p. 269; Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Supp. 1918, arts. 5246-1 to 5246-91), on account of the death of her brother, O. O Boudreaux. April 17, 1920, while employed as a diver by the National Shipbuilding Company, he submerged himself from a floating barge anchored \n\n[270 U.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n in the navigable Sabine river 35 feet from the bank, for the purpose of sawing off the timbers of an abandoned set of ways, once used for launching ships, which had become an obstruction to navigation. While thus submerged, the air supply failed, and he died of suffocation.\n The employing company carried a policy of insurance with plaintiff in error conditioned to pay the compensation prescribed by the statute and accordingly was 'regarded as a subscriber' to the Texas Employers' Insurance Association therein provided for. Par. 1, s 3 of the statutes declares:\n'The employe s of a subscriber shall have no right of action against their employer for damages for personal injuries, and the representatives and beneficiaries of deceased employe s shall have no right of action against such subscribing employer for damages for injuries resulting in death, but such employe s and their representatives and beneficiaries shall look for compensation solely to the association, as the same is hereinafter provided for. ...'\n\n It also prescribes a schedule of weekly payments for injured employe s or their beneficiaries, and provides for a board to pass upon claims and an ultimate right to proceed in court. Subscribers' employe s do not contribute to the necessary costs of such protection. They are presumed to accept the plan and to waive all right to recover damages for injuries at common law or under any statute unless they give definite written notice to the contrary. No such notice was given by the deceased.\n Plaintiff in error insists that the claim arose out of a maritime tort, that the rights and obligations of the parties were fixed by the maritime law, and that the state had no power to change these by statute or otherwise.\n This subject was much considered in Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469, 477\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008, here on certificate, which arose out of injuries suffered by a carpenter \n\n[270 U.S. 59, 64]\n\u00a0\n while at work upon an uncompleted vessel lying in navigable waters within the state of Oregon. The words of the local statute applied to the employment and prescribed an exclusive remedy. We said the cause was controlled by the principle that, as to certain local matters regulation of which would work no material prejudice to the general maritime law, the rules of the latter may be modified or supplemented by state statutes. And we held that under the circumstances disclosed-\n'regulation of the rights, obligations and consequent liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, by a local rule would not necessarily work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law, or interfere with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations.'\n\n Stressing the point that the parties were clearly and consciously within the terms of the statute and did not in fact suppose they were contracting with reference to the general system of maritime law, we alluded to the circumstance, not otherwise of special importance, that each of them had contributed to the industrial accident fund.\n And answering the certified questions we affirmed that:\n'The general admiralty jurisdiction extends to a proceeding to recover damages resulting from a tort committed on a vessel in process of construction when lying on navigable waters within a state.'\n\n Also that:\n'In the circumstances stated the exclusive features of the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act (Or. L. s 6605 et seq.) would apply and abrogate the right to recover damages in an admiralty court which otherwise would exist.'\n\n In the cause now under consideration the record discloses facts sufficient to show a maritime tort to which the general admiralty jurisdiction would extend save for the provisions of the state Compensation Act; but the matter is of mere local concern and its regulation by the state will work no material prejudice to any characteristic \n\n[270 U.S. 59, 65]\n\u00a0\n feature of the general maritime law. The act prescribes the only remedy; its exclusive features abrogate the right to resort to the admiralty court which otherwise would exist.\n We had occasion to consider matters which were not of mere local concern because of their special relation to commerce and navigation, and held them beyond the regulatory power of the state, in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479\n, 43 S. Ct. 418, Washington v. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302, Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock Co., \n266 \nU.S. 171\n, 45 S.

Joyce, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellants.\n Mr. Eugene E. Horton, of Peoria, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit by the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company and its receiver against the Peoria & Pekin Union Railway Company was brought on August 6, 1925, in the federal court for Southern Iowa. Its purpose is to enjoin the defendant from refusing to switch cars for the plaintiffs, the claim being that the defendant is directed to perform this service by an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated April 13, 1922. The controversy between the parties has been repeatedly before the Commission. One phase was considered by this court in Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 194, \n263 U.S. 528\n. The case at par presents only questions of jurisdiction and procedure. \n\n[270 U.S. 580, 582]\n\u00a0\n The defendant is an Illinois corporation, with its principal place of business in that state. The only service upon it was made there. Appearing specially, it objected both to the service and to the jurisdiction of the court, and moved that the service be quashed and the bill be dismissed. The plaintiffs contended that, under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, the federal court for Southern Iowa had jurisdiction and the service was good, because the suit is one to enforce an order of the Commission made on petition of the plaintiff company, a resident of that district. The court held, upon final hearing, that the order was no longer in effect when this suit was begun, and that, for this reason, it was without jurisdiction over the defendant. The decree entered set aside the service of process and dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction. The case is here on direct appeal under paragraph 4 of section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 1215). The Peoria Company concedes that the order was duly entered April 13, 1922. Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Peoria & Pekin, Union Ry. Co., 68 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 412. The Minneapolis & St. Louis concedes that, unless the order was still in force when the bill was filed, the service was a nullity and the court without jurisdiction over the defendants. Compare Robertson v. Railroad Labor Board, 45 S. Ct. 621, \n268 U.S. 619\n, 622; Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing Co., 40 S. Ct. 385, \n252 U.S. 436\n. The main question for decision is whether, on the facts to be stated, the order was in force at the time the bill was filed.\n The Commission had found that the Peoria Company discriminated against the Minneapolis & St. Louis by imposing upon it a switching charge while certain other carriers were not required to pay any charge. By the order of April 13, 1922, the Commission directed that the discrimination be removed. That order left the Peoria Company free to remove the discrimination either by discontinuing \n\n[270 U.S. 580, 583]\n\u00a0\n the charge complained of or by making a like charge to the other lines. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., 44 S. Ct. 189, \n263 U.S. 515\n, 521. It elected to remove the discrimination by making a charge to the other carriers, and filed tariffs to that end. The other carriers protested. The new tariffs were suspended for consideration by the Commission in a new proceeding, known as Investigation and Suspension Docket No. 1596. At the request of the Minneapolis & St. Louis, the proceeding which it had brought was, by order of July 10, 1922, reopened for further hearing in this connection. On December 22, 1922, the Commission concluded that the new tariffs were not justified, and that a still broader investigation involving additional parties must be had before just rates could be established. Intermediate Switching Charges at Peoria, Ill., 77 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 43. On that day, it entered an order in the original proceeding brought by the Minneapolis & St. Louis 'that the complaint in this proceeding be, and it is hereby, dismissed.' On the same day it entered in the later proceeding an order that the new tariffs be canceled.\n The Peoria Company concluded that the order dismissing the complaint in the proceeding instituted by the Minneapolis & St. Louis had the effect of rescinding the order of April 13, 1922, based thereon, and that its original tariff of charges against the Minneapolis & St. Louis, which had never been canceled, remained in full force. On January 4, 1923, it notified the Commission that it would act accordingly. On January 5, 1923, the chairman of division 5 of the Commission1 telegraphed the Peoria \n\n[270 U.S. 580, 584]\n\u00a0\n Company that the order of April 13, 1922, 'still stands unrescinded.' On January 8, 1923, the Commission entered, of its own motion, pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended (Comp St. Supp. 1925, s 8581), an order for a general investigation into switching charges at Peoria. With the proceeding so ordered, it reopened and consolidated the earlier ones. On January 18, 1923, the Commission issued the emergency service order requiring the Peoria Company to continue switching, which this court held to be void in Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 194, \n263 U.S. 528\n, decided January 7, 1924\n\n\n The Minneapolis & St. Louis contends that the dismissal of its complaint on December 22, 1922, did not operate as a rescission of the order which had been entered thereon April 13, 1922. The argument is that the order by its terms provided that it 'shall continue in force until the further order of the Commission'; that, moreover, paragraph 2 of section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 8583) provides that all orders of the Commission 'shall continue in force until its further order ... unless the same shall be suspended or modified or set aside by the Commission, or be suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction'; that no order issued in terms rescinding the order of April 13, 1922, had ever been entered; that by section 16a (Comp. St. Supp. s 8585) the mere reopening of the case by the Commission did not so operate; and that, as the Commission in ordering dismissal of the complaint did not refer to the order of April 13, 1922, the latter remained in full force. The contention is unsound. The order of December 22, 1922, dismissed the complaint without making any reservation. It operated, therefore, to rescind the order of April 13, 1922, which rested on that complaint alone. Compare Greenleaf v. Queen, 1 Pet. 138, 148, 149; Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., 31 S. Ct. 492, \n221 \nU.S. 418, 451\n, 34 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 874; Coleman v. Hudson River Bridge Co., Fed. Cas. No. 2,983, 5 Blatchf. 56, 58.\n The Minneapolis & St. Louis contends, also, that if the dismissal of the complaint operated as a rescission of the \n\n[270 U.S. 580, 585]\n\u00a0\n order of April 13, 1922, later action of the Commission restored it. The argument is that the telegram of January 5, 1923, and subsequent action of the Commission show that it was not its intention, when dismissing the complaint, to rescind the order; that paragraph 6 of section 16 of the act as amended (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 8584) authorized the Commission to modify 'its orders upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper'; that the order of January 8, 1823, besides providing for the general investigation, provided that the original proceeding of the Minneapolis & St. Louis be 'reopended, consolidated with, and made a part of this investigation'; and that thereby the Commission restored the order of April 13, 1922. This contention, also, is unsound. The Commission did not at any time before the bringing of this suit make any order which purported either to rescind the order of dismissal of December 22, 1922, or to restore the order of April 13, 1922, or which made any reference either to such dismissal or to a restoration. The opinion of a commissioner, expressed in the telegram of January 5, 1923, that the order of April 13, 1922, was in full force despite the dismissal of the complaint was without legal significance. The effect of the order of dismissal entered December 22, 1922, must be determined by the terms of the order, unless and until modified by formal action of the Commission. It cannot be affected by what a member of the Commission may declare informally was intended. The order of January 8, 1923, had the effect of restoring to the docket the original proceeding instituted by the Minneapolis & St. Louis; but by reopening the case for further hearing, the Commission did not indicate a purpose to restore the order of April 13, 1922. Compare Knox County v. Harshman, 10 S. Ct. 8, \n132 \nU.S. 14, 16\n, 17 S..\n The Minneapolis & St. Louis seeks, through a motion to remand, to avoid affirmance of the decree which must otherwise result from overruling these contentions. This \n\n[270 U.S. 580, 586]\n\u00a0\n motion, which was filed on January 7, 1926, prayed that the case be remanded to the District Court with instructions to allow it to file a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, because of matters arising since the filing of the record in this court. It prayed in the alternative that this court treat the record here as supplemented by incorporating a statement of these later occurrences. They are as follows: On November 2, 1925, the Minneapolis & St. Louis filed in the federal court for Southern Iowa a suit against the United States in which it prayed that the order of December 22, 1922, be annulled in so far as it operated to revoke the order of April 13, 1922. On November 10, 1925, the Commission, on its own motion, ordered that its order of December 22, 1922, dismissing the complaint of the Minneapolis & St. Louis 'be, and it is hereby, vacated and set aside.' Still later, following the proceeding before the Commission known as Rates, Regulations, and Practices of Peoria & Pekin Union Railway Company at Peoria, Ill., and Nearby Points, 93 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 3, the examiner recommended that the original tariff of the Peoria Company complained of by the Minneapolis & St. Louis be canceled. The later facts alleged could not conceivably affect the result of the case before us. The jurisdiction of the lower court depends upon the state of things existing at the time the suit was brought. Mullen v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537; Anderson v. Watt, 11 S. Ct. 449, \n138 U.S. 694\n. The situation is wholly unlike that in Ballard v. Searls, 9 S. Ct. 418, \n130 U.S. 50\n, upon which the Minneapolis & St. Louis relies. The motion to remand is denied.\n The Peoria Company makes this further objection. The order of April 13, 1922, directed the removal of the discrimination to which the Minneapolis & St. Louis was subjected, but left the Peoria Company free to select the method of doing so. It elected to impose like switching charges upon the other carriers and to that end filed new tariffs. These were canceled by the order of December \n\n[270 U.S. 580, 587]\n\u00a0\n 22, 1922. Thus the method to be pursued in removing the discrimination was left at large. The Peoria Company contends that, even if the order of April 13, 1922, be deemed to have been in force, selection and approval of the method to be pursued in the removal of discrimination present administrative problems, and that further action by the Commission would be required before any court could be called upon to enforce that order. As the District Court for Southern Iowa was without jurisdiction of this suit because that order was not in force, we need not consider this objection.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pursuant to paragraph 4 of section 17 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended (Comp.

St.  8657-8665), and the Safety Appliance Act of 1893, 27 Stat. 531, c. 196, as amended by the Act of 1903, 32 Stat. 943, c. 976 (Comp. St .  8605-8615). He recovered judgment, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. Goneau v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. R. Co., 159 Minn. 41, 198 N. W. 403, 405. The writ of certiorari was granted in June, 1924. \n265 \nU.S. 579\n, 44 S. Ct. 638\n\n\n A motion was interposed to dismiss the writ of certiorari, the further consideration of which was postponed to the hearing on the merits. We find that the motion is not well founded; and it is denied.\n By section 2 of the original Safety Appliance Act (Comp. St.  8606) as amended by the Act of 1903-upon which the respondent relies-it is made unlawful to haul or permit to be hauled or used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce any car not equipped with automatic couplers which can be operated 'without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' And by section 4 of the Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8660) it is provided that an employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by the carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributes to his injury or death.\n By section 4 of the Supplemental Safety Appliance Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 298, c. 160 (Comp. St.  8621)-upon which the petitioner relies-it is provided that where a car has been properly equipped and its equipment becomes defective while it is being used by the carrier upon its line of railroad, the car may be hauled, if necessary, from the place where the \n\n[269 U.S. 406, 408]\n\u00a0\n defect is first discovered to the nearest available point where it can be repaired, without liability for penalties,1 but without releasing the carrier from liability for the injury of any employee caused by or in connection with the hauling of the car with such defective equipment.\n It is admitted that the Railway Company was engaged in interstate commerce, and that Goneau was employed in such commerce. There was substantial evidence tending to show the following state of facts: Goneau was the rear brakeman on a freight train which broke in two, between stations, in the night time; the two sections of the train stopping a few feet apart, on a narrow wooden bridge with open ties. The breaking of the train was caused by a defective coupler on the rear end of the last car in the front section. The defect was in the carrier iron, a bar or plate bolted cross-wise under the drawbar, which held the coupler in a position where it would interlock with that of the opposite car. Several bolts of this carrier iron were missing, and the nut had come off the bolt holding up one of its ends,-the threads being battered and partly stripped,-so that this end had fallen off the bolt and swung back slantingly underneath the drawbar, causing the coupler to drop down so that it no longer interlocked; and thus breaking the train in two. When the train stopped, Goneau, on an order from the conductor, went forward to ascertain the trouble; and, after he had discovered it, undertook, as was his duty, to get the train coupled up again so that it could proceed on its journey. To make the coupling it was necessary to get the carrier iron back in place so as to hold the coupler in a position where it would interlock. He made an effort to do this by pulling the carrier iron back into a right angled position and placing wooden wedges or 'shims' which he found on the bank, between it and the drawbar. This raised the coupler so that it would partially interlock. \n\n[269 U.S. 406, 409]\n\u00a0\n Upon his signals, the cars were then coupled together and the train started upon its journey. But after proceeding a few feet, it again broke and the two sections stopped a second time upon the bridge. Finding the coupler in its former condition, he then attempted to make another coupling. To do this he again stood between the cars on the open ties, with his back to the outside of the bridge; and, as before, put one knee under the drawbar to raise it from the carrier iron, and with one hand attempted to pull the carrier iron around to a right angle with the drawbar. The carrier iron caught in some manner, and he failed at first to move it. He then braced himself, lifted more with his knee, and gave the carrier iron a harder pull, with both hands. This time it 'came easy,' causing his right foot to drop down between the ties; and, losing his balance, he fell backwards over the side of the bridge to the ground below, sustaining serious injuries.\n The Railway Company contends that the evidence did not bring the case within the Safety Appliance Act or warrant its submission to the jury under that Act; the argument being, in substance, that the defective car, being motionless at the time of the accident, was not then in use; that Goneau was not engaged in any coupling operation or car movement, but was doing repair work at the place where the defect was first discovered, which was permitted by the Act of 1910, and whose risk he assumed; and that the defective condition of the carrier iron was merely a condition presenting the occasion for making the repairs, and not a proximate cause of the accident.\n We cannot sustain this contention. Under the circumstances indicated it is clear that the use of the defective car had not ended at the time of the accident, although it was then motionless. A defective car is still in use when it has been moved with the train from the main line to a siding, to be cut out and left so that the other cars may proceed on their journey. Chicago Railroad v. \n\n[269 U.S. 406, 410]\n\u00a0\n Schendel, \n267 \nU.S. 287, 291\n, 45 S. Ct. 303. And so it is while still in a section of the train on the main line, to be coupled up and proceed on its journey as a part of the train. And see Baltimore Railroad v. Tittle (C. C. A.) 4 F. (2d) 818, 820.\n Nor can it be said that Goneau was engaged in doing repair work. He was not a repair man, but a brakeman, and was not repairing the carrier iron, but attempting to move it into place to support the coupler, so that the coupling could be made and the train proceed. In short, he was engaged in the work of coupling the cars, that is, as was said by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, 'in a coupling operation.' Where, on the failure of cars to couple by impact, a switchman goes between them for the purpose of adjusting the knuckle of a coupler so that it will make a coupling, and is injured by the fall of the knuckle, due to a broken lip, he is not engaged in repair work, but in coupling, and is within the protection of the Safety Appliance Act. Baltimore Railroad v. Tittle, supra, 820. And although Goneau, in testifying, stated that when he found the coupler in such a condition that he could not couple up the train unless he fixed it, it became his duty to 'repair it and get the train going,' his use of the word 'repair,' upon which the Railway Company lays great stress, does not change the situation in the eyes of the law or transform the coupling operation into repair work.\n Since he was injured as a result of the defect in the coupler while attempting to adjust it for the purpose of making an immediate coupling, the defective coupler was clearly a proximate cause of the accident as distinguished from a condition creating the situation in which it occurred. And under the Employer's Liability Act he cannot be held to have assumed the risk.\n The Act of 1910, obviously, has no application.\n As there was substantial evidence tending to show that the defective coupler was a proximate cause of the acci- \n\n[269 U.S. 406, 411]\n\u00a0\n dent resulting in the injury to Goneau while he was engaged in making a coupling in the discharge of his duty, the case was rightly submitted to the jury under the Safety Appliance Act; and the issues having been determined by the jury in his favor, the judgment of the trial court was properly affirmed.

St.  8610). \n\n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC. R. CO. v. BOONE(1926)\nNo. 203\nArgued: January 29, 1926Decided: March 22, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 466, 467]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Merritt U. Hayden, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Fred L. English, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1922, Byrd J. Boone, a passenger on an intrastate journey in Missouri over the Missouri Pacific Railroad, checked a trunk which she took with her. It arrived safely at its destination, but was not delivered to her, because a thief obtained possession through the device of changing checks. She brought this suit against the carrier in a court of the state, and claimed that, under section 9941 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri of 1919, she was entitled to the full value. This law, first enacted in 1855 (Rev. Stat. Mo. c. 39, s 45), had never been suspended or repealed by any law of the state. The defendant relied upon a baggage tariff which limited liability to $100 unless a greater value was declared and extra payment made. This tariff, applicable to both intrastate and interstate traffic, had been duly filed by the Director General of Railroads pursuant to the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, s 10, 40 Stat. 451, 456 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 3115 3\/4 j), and was in force on the termination of federal control, February 29, 1920. The defendant contended that, by virtue of \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 468]\n\u00a0\n section 208(a) of Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 464 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 10071 1\/4 d), this limitation had remained in force as applied to intrastate commerce, because the provision for unlimited liability contained in section 9941 of the Missouri Revised Statutes had not been re-enacted after the termination of federal control.\n Section 208(a) provides:\n'All rates, fares, and charges, and all classifications, regulations, and practices, in any wise changing, affecting, or determining, any part or the aggregate of rates, fares, or charges, or the value of the service rendered, which on February 29, 1920, are in effect on the lines of carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, shall continue in force and effect until thereafter changed by state or federal authority, respectively, or pursuant to authority of law; but prior to September 1, 1920, no such rate, fare, or charge shall be reduced, and no such classification, regulation, or practice shall be changed in such manner as to reduce any such rate, fare, or charge, unless such reduction or change is approved by the Commission.'\n\n The trial court entered judgment for $1,000 and interest. The judgment was affirmed by the St. Louis Court of Appeals, the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had. 263 S. W. 495. The court held that, under the law of Missouri, misdelivery of the trunk was a conversion which rendered the carrier liable for its full value, and that the state law governed because the journey was intrastate. This court granted a writ of certiorari. 45 S. Ct. 196, \n266 U.S. 600\n. Under the federal law misdelivery is not deemed a conversion depriving a carrier of the benefit of the provision limiting liability. American Railway Express Co. v. Levee, 44 S. Ct. 11, \n263 U.S. 19\n, 21. The sole question for decision is the construction and effect to be given section 208(a).\n The provision in the baggage tariff limiting liability is within the purview of that section. There was no \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n legislation by the state on the subject after the termination of federal control. The state had confessedly power to restore the full statutory liability as applied to intrastate commerce unless the Interstate Commerce Commission should, for the purpose of preventing discrimination against interstate commerce, issue an order under Transportation Act 1920 to the contrary. See Railroad Commission of Wis. v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 42 S. Ct. 232, \n257 U.S. 563\n, 22 A. L. R. 1086; New York v. United States, 42 S. Ct. 239, \n257 U.S. 591\n. There was no such order. Compare Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 37 S. Ct. 173, \n242 U.S. 333\n. The precise question is whether the state provision, which had been suspended by the filing of the tariffs of the Director General, became operative on September 1, 1920, without re-enactment, or whether affirmative action by the state after February 29, 1920, was necessary to restore the full liability theretofore created by its statute and which it had not repealed. The analogy of state insolvent laws suspended by the enactment of a bankruptcy act, and again becoming operative upon its repeal, was relied upon. See Tua v. Carriere, 6 S. Ct. 565, \n117 U.S. 201\n; Butler v. Goreley, 13 S. Ct. 84, \n146 U.S. 303\n.\n Most of the rates, fares, and charges in effect on February 29, 1920, had been established without suspending any provision of any statute or the order of any regulatory body. They related to matters with which, both before and after federal control, carriers were, in the main, at liberty to deal in their discretion, without first securing the consent of either the federal or the state commission. For despite the enlarging sphere of regulation, the field in which the carrier may exercise initiative and discretion was and is still a wide one. \n1\n The existing right of the \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 470]\n\u00a0\n carriers to initiate rates was transferred by the second paragraph of section 10 of the Federal Control Act to the Director General, with three modifications. \n2\n The Interstate Commerce Commission for the time was made the regulatory body in respect to intrastate as well as ionterstate rates. The power of suspending tariffs involving increases (which had been first conferred upon the Commission by Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, s 12, 36 Stat. 539, 552 (Comp. St. s 8583)) was denied to it in respect to such as were filed by the Director General. And the power to fix the date when the new tariffs should take effect was vested in the Director General, instead of being fixed (as provided by section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act ( Comp. St. s 8569)) at not less than 30 days subject to the discretion of the Commission. It was by virtue of the ordinary corporate power of carriers to establish rates, so transferred to the Director General, that the rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations and practices referred to in the first clause of section 208(a) had, in the main, been established. 3 \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n In support of the judgment below, it is contended that the section would be unconstitutional, if construed as providing that the Missouri statute, although applicable only to intrastate commerce, should not become operative unless and until re-enacted. The argument is this: If so construed, the Act of Congress would, in effect repeal all such state laws affecting intrastate commerce existing at the termination of federal control, while granting to the states permission to legislate on the subject thereafter or recognizing their power to do so. The prohibition of reductions of intrastate rates during the six months' period of guaranteed return, was a proper exercise of power incident to federal operation and control during the war. Congress could, under that power, also make reasonable provision to ensure workable tariffs on the restoration of the railroads to their owners. But a repeal by Congress of all such existing state laws, affecting intrastate commerce, coupled with permission to enact new ones, would not be an appropriate means to that end, nor could such legislation be sustained under the commerce clause. Regulation by a state of intrastate rates is not a function exercised by permission of the federal government (In re Rahrer, 11 S. Ct. 865, \n140 U.S. 545\n, 564), or because of its inaction. The power of Congress over intrastate rates conferred by the commerce clause is limited to action reasonably necessary for the protection of interstate commerce. Railroad Commission of Wis v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 42 S. Ct. 232, \n257 U.S. 563\n, 22 A. L. R. 1086. No necessity is here shown. Such is the argument. The section, if so construed, would, at least, raise a grave and doubtful \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n constitutional question. Under the settled practice, a construction which does so will not be adopted, where some other is open to us. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 29 S. Ct. 527, \n213 U.S. 366\n, 408; Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., 44 S. Ct. 366, \n264 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 32 S. A. L. R. 786. An examination of the section in the light of the then existing federal and state law will make clear that another and reasonable construction is open to us, and that it should prevail.\n Section 208(a) contains two clauses. Each was to take effect immediately. Each dealt with rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations and practices. But in purpose, character, and scope the two clauses differ widely. The primary purpose of the second clause was to protect the United States from liability on its guaranty to the carriers of the standard return. It sought to do so by prohibiting any reduction of rates, fares or charges without the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The prohibition applied alike to intrastate and to interstate rates. It extended to reductions made by the carriers, as well as to those made by the states. But the prohibition was limited to reductions. Increases might be made. The prohibition was confined to the first six months after the surrender of the railroads to their owners, because the government guaranty was limited to that period.\n The first clause of section 208(a) is legislation permanent in character. It relates alike to changes which increase rates and to those which reduce. It contains no prohibition. It explains. Its purpose was not to conserve revenues but to remove doubts and avoid confusion. A clarifying provision was needed. Comprehensive changes in the rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations and practices had been made by the Director General by filing the same with the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to power conferred by section 10 of the Federal Control \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 473]\n\u00a0\n Act. It was important that carriers and the public should know whether, and to what extent, these changed rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations and practices would continue in force after the return of the railroads to their owners. This information the first clause supplied by specifying what tariffs were applicable. To facilitate the conduct of business by this means was an appropriate exercise of the power of Congress. To have undertaken to do so by means of abrogating all rates, fares and charges established by the several states in respect to intrastate commerce, and all classifications and regulations affecting them, would not have been. It is not lightly to be assumed that Congress would have resorted to means so extraordinary for securing workable tariffs.\n It is suggested that, although the primary purpose of the first clause of section 208(a) was to facilitate the conduct of business, Congress intended thereby also to protect the carrier's revenues, and that a requirement of an affirmative exercise of state power after termination of federal control would, by presenting an obstacle to change make reductions of rates by the states difficult, and thus result in protecting the carrier's revenues. That Congress did not devise the first clause as a means of so protecting revenues appears from the character of the provision there made. The clause applies equally, whether the rate made by the Director General was a reduction or an increase of the rate in effect before federal control. The clause left the several states free to proceed at once to establish reductions, and to make them effective upon the expiration of the government's guaranty. Whether a particular state could avail itself of that liberty would thus depend wholly upon its own Constitution, legislation and practice. If at the time Transportation Act 1920 was enacted the Legislature either happened to be in session or could be promptly convened, the state might by a single statute \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 474]\n\u00a0\n have restored, as of September 1, 1920, its rates, fares, and charges and all classifications, regulations, and practices affecting them, no matter what change the Director General had made. In those states where the rate- making power was vested in a regulatory body in continuous session, a like result could have been attained through a single order. On the other hand, in those states where the local law did not permit such prompt action by the rate-making authority, the restoration of rates by state action would necessarily have been deferred. It is not to be assumed that Congress intended to adopt a means of protection which would have been indirect, fortuitous and largely futile, and which would obviously have produced such inequalities among the states, when direct, certain, and better means of protection were available.\n Moreover, there was no purpose in Congress to maintain in force, after the expiration of the six months' guaranty period, either the interstate or the intrastate rates which had been established by the Director General. It was recognized, when Transportation Act 1920 was enacted, that these were not high enough to yield to the carriers adequate revenues. Means of increasing them were specifically provided by those sections of Transportation Act 1922 which prescribe the essentials of a fair return and empower the Commission, upon notice to the states and with their co-operation, to prevent discrimination against interstate commerce resulting from unduly low intrastate rates, fares and charges. See sections 415, 416, and 422 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, ss 8576, 8581, 8583a). Proceedings were in contemplation by means of which it was proposed to establish largely increased rates on the expiration of the government's guaranty, September 1, 1920. The order for such general increase made by Exparte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 220, on July 29, 1920, followed extensive hearings in which commissions representing the states participated. \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 475]\n\u00a0\n Proceedings were instituted in the states before September 1, 1920, to secure corresponding increases of the intrastate rates. And further proceedings were had before the federal commission to remove obstacles to increases of the intrastate rates which existed in same of the states. \n4\n The six months' prohibition of reductions provided for by the second clause of section 208(a) afforded carriers and the Interstate Commerce Commission ample opportunity to take such action as might be deemed advisable for carrying out the new policy established by Transportation Act 1920\n\n\n When the first clause of section 208(a) is examined in the light of these facts, the construction to be given it becomes clear. In order to remove doubts as to what tariffs were to be applicable after the termination of federal control, Congress declared that the existing tariffs, largely initiated by the Director General, should be deemed operative, except so far as changed thereafter-that is, after February 29, 1920-pursuant to law. Such modification of intrastate tariffs might result from action of the carriers taken on their own initiative. It might result from orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It might result from the making either of new state laws or of new orders of a state commission acting under old laws still in force and again becoming operative. Or such modification might result from the mere cessation of the suspension, which had been effected through federal control, of statutes or orders theretofore in force and still unaffected by any \n\n[270 U.S. 466, 476]\n\u00a0\n action of the authority which made them. In any of these cases, the change would be effected 'thereafter'; that is, after the termination of federal control. The statute of Missouri enforced by its courts was in effect in 1922.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Even under Transportation Act 1920, the power inheres in the carriers, to initiate increases or decreases of rates, fares, and charges, subject, of course to the control of the appropriate regulatory body. Increases or decreases of interstate rates may, without action by the Interstate Commerce Commission, become operative after 30 days' notice by the simple act of filing, unless the Commission suspends them. See Interstate Commerce Act, section 6(3) and section 15(7) (Comp. St. ss 8569, 8583). The power of the carrier to initiate intrastate rates, fares and charges, is even broader in many states.

St.  7482a), the Interstate Commerce Commission was directed 'to fix and determine from time to time the fair and reasonable rates and compensation for the transportation of ... mail matter by railway common carriers and the service connected therewith, prescribing the method or methods by weight, or space, or both, or otherwise, for ascertaining such rate or compensation. ...' In respect of land grant lines, the act provides:\n'The Interstate Commerce Commission shall allow to railroad companies whose railroads were constructed in \n\n[271 U.S. 603, 605]\n\u00a0\n whole or in part by a land grant made by Congress on condition that the mails should be transported over their roads at such price as Congress should by law direct only eighty per centum of the compensation paid other railroads for transporting the mails and all service by the railroads in connection therewith.'\n\n The act confers upon the Postmaster General the power to state railroad mail routes and authorizes mail service thereon of four classes, the first two of which are: (1) Full railway post office car service; (2) apartment railway post office car service. For the first class, service is to be 'by cars forty feet or more in length, constructed, fitted up, and maintained for the distribution of mails on trains.' For the second class, the service is the same 'by apartments less than forty feet in length,' etc. The service is to include the carriage of mail matter, equipment, and supplies for the mail service and the employees of the Postal Service or Post Office Department, as the Postmaster General shall direct to be carried. All cars and parts of cars used for the service are to be of such construction, style, length, and character, and furnished in such manner as the Postmaster General shall require, and are to be constructed, fitted up, maintained, heated, lighted, and cleaned by and at the expense of the railroad companies. The railroad companies are required to furnish all necessary facilities for caring for and handling the mails while in their custody. The act further provides that all railway common carriers are required to transport such mail matter as may be offered for transportation, etc., and shall be entitled to receive fair and reasonable compensation 'for such transportation and for the service connected therewith.'\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, after a hearing, made an exhaustive report and determined that mail should be carried upon the basis of space, instead of weight. Upon that basis, the Commission fixed rates for \n\n[271 U.S. 603, 606]\n\u00a0\n all services required to be performed by the act and declared that the land grant railroads were entitled to 80 per cent. thereof under the law. It was urged before the Commission on behalf of these railroads that this provision of the law 'should not apply to the distributing space in R. P. O. and apartment cars, because the service of carrying distributing facilities cannot properly be construed as transportation of the mails as defined in the law.' But the Commission held otherwise. Railway Mail Pay, 56 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 1, 77. Thereupon appellant filed its petition in the court below, alleging the facts and praying judgment against the United States for $189,880.54 as compensation for the use of the distributing space upon the same ground as that urged before the Commission. The amount of the demand was arrived at by separating the car space said to be used for mail distributing purposes from the space devoted to storage purposes, and adding 20 per cent. to that portion of the 80 per cent. allowance which was claimed to be assignable to the distributing space. The Court of Claims sustained a demurrer to the petition and entered judgment of dismissal. 59 Ct. Cl. 524; 60 Ct. Cl. 183.\n That the Commission is authorized by the act of 1916 to fix rates for the transportation of the mails, that the rates fixed by the Commission are reasonable, and that Congress has plenary power to determine the price at which the land grant roads shall transport the mail, are propositions which are not here in dispute. The contention is that this power does not enable Congress to fix the pay of the land grant roads for furnishing distributing space and facilities, but that these items under the requirement of the land grant acts are separable from and in addition to transportation, and should be paid for at the same rates accorded other railroads.\n Unmistakably, the act of 1916 authorized the Commission to do precisely what it did, namely, to determine the \n\n[271 U.S. 603, 607]\n\u00a0\n fair and reasonable rates and compensation to be paid, upon a space basis, for the transportation of mail matter 'and the service connected therewith,' and thereupon to allow the land grant roads 80 per cent. of those rates and compensation for like transportation 'and all service ... in connection therewith.' It would do manifest violence to these plain words to say that Congress intended, in the one case, that the Commission should fix the compensation to be paid railroads generally for transportation, including service connected therewith, but did not intend, in the other case, although it used almost the same words, that 80 per cent. of that compensation, and no more, should be allowed the land grant roads for like transportation and service.\n But it is urged that thus to construe the act of 1916 is to enlarge the authority of Congress under the land grant acts, so as to permit that body to require the land grant roads, without compensation, to perform service in addition to that embraced within the word 'transportation.' It is said that railway postal cars originated after the passage of the land grant acts. But it does not follow that such cars are not fairly within the meaning of those acts as essentially incident to transportation. The provision reaches into the future, and, while its meaning does not change, its application may well embrace new conditions and new instrumentalities which come within the scope of the terms employed. This is in accordance with the universal law of language. In a sense, words do not change their meaning; but the application of words grows and expands with the growth and expansion of society. Compare South Carolina v. United States, \n199 U.S. 437\n, 448-449, 26 S. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737.\n To transport and article involves, as a necessary incident, furnishing facilities for its transportation, and the character and extent of these facilities will depend upon the nature of the thing transported. Facilities appropri- \n\n[271 U.S. 603, 608]\n\u00a0\n ately employed in the transportation of lumber, for example, would be wholly inappropriate in the transportation of live stock. The mail includes a variety of things gathered from and carried to innumerable places. Letters and parcels must be received, more or less piecemeal, and then assorted and put in convenient form for delivery at the places to which they are addressed, and, if the mails are to go forward with dispatch, this involves assortment and preparation for delivery in transit, and this, in turn, necessarily requires that facilities to that end must be provided.\n Nor can we ignore the provision of the land grant acts that the mails are to be transported 'under the direction of the Post Office Department.' The authority is a continuing one and not to be limited to such methods of direction as were customary at the dates of the acts. The mail was to be transported 'at all times' under this direction. The power of the Post Office Department to direct the transportation is of the same quality as the power of Congress to fix the price, and includes not only the authority to say when the transportation shall take place and between what points, but to impose such conditions as are necessarily incident to the transportation, having regard to the peculiar nature of the things to be transported. We fully agree with the court below that the land grant acts are not to be so narrowly construed as to render their operation impracticable. 'When they declare that the mails shall be transported under the direction of the Post Office Department, we think they imply more than the mere placing of the mails in bulk in a car to be carried between given termini. The bulk changes by additions to it and subtractions from it. The making of these additions and subtractions as the different stations are reached involves space additional to that occupied by the bulk itself. What is to be transported is not mere weight, bulk or freight, but the 'mails,' and the act must be construed to give effect to its purpose.'\n\n\n[271 U.S. 603, 609]\n\u00a0\n We fairly may assume, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that, in fixing the allowance to be paid to the land grant roads at 80 per cent. of the fair and reasonable compensation to be paid railroads generally, Congress has given due weight to all the circumstances-not only to the kind and character of the service, but to the fact that the companies are required to furnish all facilities incidental thereto. In any event, it was for Congress to say what reduction should be made from the amount of full compensation in consideration of the land grants, and its action in that respect is not open to judicial review.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K. & T. RY. CO. v. STATE OF OKL.(1926)\nNo. 205\nArgued: Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Jeseph M. Bryson and Charles S. Burg, both of St. Louis, Mo., Maurice D. Green, of Muskogee, Okl., and Howard L. Smith, of Tulsa, Okl., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Wm. J. Horton, of McAlester, Okl., E. S. Ratiff, of Oklahoma City, Okl., and Jackman A. Gill, of McAlester, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The railroad of plaintiff in error runs through the city of McAlester, Okl. At Comanche avenue the main \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 304]\n\u00a0\n line is on a fill, and at least one industrial or side track is on a lower level. In September, 1921, the city applied to the state Corporation Commission for an order requiring the railway company to provide at that place a pass under its tracks and a highway across its right of way. The commission ordered that the company prepare a plan and an estimate of quantities and cost for a reinforced concrete subway, having two openings of specified dimensions; that the plan show the location of industrial tracks, and that these tracks conform to the street grade; that the plan and estimate be filed with the mayor of the city and the Corporation Commission; and that, if the company and the city failed to agree on an apportionment of cost of the underpass, the commission would hear evidence on that subject. The company was ordered to have the underpass constructed and open for traffic within 90 days after arrangement by the city to pay its portion of the cost. The company filed its petition in the Supreme Court to have the order set aside on the grounds, among others, that it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and impairs the obligation of a contract, in violation of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. The court affirmed the order (107 Okl. 23, 229 P. 172), and the case is here on writ of error. Section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n The line was built about 1873 on land granted by Congress to the company-then known as the Union Pacific Railroad Company, southern branch- for the construction of its railroad. Act July 26, 1866,  8, c. 270, 14 Stat. 289, 291. The city of South McAlester and the town site of McAlester were laid out subsequently, pursuant to the Act of Congress of June 28, 1898,  14, c. 517, 30 Stat. 495, 499. In platting these town sites, streets were laid out to the boundary line on each side of the land constituting the company's right of way. November 8, 1901, the city passed Ordinance No. 74. At \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 305]\n\u00a0\n that time there were a number of unauthorized crossings in use by the public, but the city had not acquired by purchase or condemnation the right of way for the extension of any street across the railroad. The ordinance was accepted by the company and is in form a contract. It provided for the immediate extension of certain platted streets across the right of way, tracks, and station grounds of the company in lieu of the unauthorized crossings then in use. Some of the new crossings were to be constructed by the company at its own expense, and the cost of others was to be borne equally by the parties. Terms and conditions for the construction of other crossings were set forth in the ordinance. It was declared that thereafter the city would open no other street across the right of way and tracks of the company, except upon payment of amounts specified in the ordinance as stipulated damages for a right of way across the railroad, any determination in condemnation proceedings instituted by the city, whether more or less than the agreed sum, to the contrary notwithstanding. It was stated that nothing contained in the ordinance should constitute a waiver of the company's right to contest the opening of additional streets. But there is no provision purporting to limit power or authority of the city to establish or regulate street crossings over, under or upon the tracks and other property of the company. And it was specifically agreed that, if at any time the city should desire to extend and open Comanche avenue across the company's right of way and station grounds, the crossing should be constructed under the tracks located upon the fill and at grade across tracks laid at the street level, according to plans and specifications approved by the company and at the sole cost and expense of the city. The company, for this and other considerations mentioned in the ordinance, agreed to waive all claims for damages caused by the opening and establishing of this crossing. \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 306]\n\u00a0\n Pursuant to the Act of Congress of March 29, 1906, c. 1351, 34 Stat. 91, the city of McAlester was created by the consolidation of the city of South McAlester and the town of McAlester. In performance of the agreements contained in the ordinance, the city of McAlester in 1909 and again in 1912 assumed and paid portions of the cost of construction of some of the crossing covered by the ordinance; and ever since the consolidation it has been recognized and treated as the successor of the city of South McAlester and as a party to the contract. The present city is bound to the same extent as was its predecessor that passed the ordinance.\n The court held that the state laws gave the commission full jurisdiction over all highways where they cross railways; that the commission had authority to order the crossing in question and to assess the cost of it against the city and the railway company, but not more than 50 per cent. against the city; that the company was the owner in fee of its right of way lands; that they could not be appropriated or damaged for public use without just compensation; and that the commission could not enforce obedience to its order to construct the grade crossing until the question of damage to the fee had been determined either by amicable settlement or by condemnation proceedings.\n The order, as interpreted and affirmed, directly contravenes the provisions of the ordinance in respect of the Comanche avenue crossing. It sets at naught the undertaking of the city to bear the cost of construction and the agreement of the company to give the city the right of way for the street crossing and to waive all claims for damages. The effect is to require the company forthwith to prepare the plan and estimate, and to direct the company-upon the determination of its just compensation and the consummation of arrangements by the city to pay the portion of the cost, if any, that may be imposed upon \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 307]\n\u00a0\n it-to proceed to construct the underpass and to have it open for traffic within the time specified. If a contract exists between the parties in respect of this crossing, it is manifest that it would be impaired by the enforcement of the commission's order.\n But defendants in error contend that the ordinance is void because it attempts to surrender police power; and therefore that there is no such contract.\n It is elementary that for the safety and convenience of the public, the state, either directly or through its municipalities, may reasonably regulate the construction and use of highways where they cross railroads. The legitimate exertion of police power to that end does not violate the constitutional rights of railroad companies. They may be required at their own expense to construct bridges or viaducts whenever the elimination of grade crossings reasonably may be required, whether constructed before or after the building of the railroads. Northern Pacific Railway v. Duluth, \n208 \nU.S. 583, 597\n, 28 S. Ct. 341; Chi., Mil. & St. P. Ry. v. Minneapolis, \n232 \nU.S. 430, 438\n, 34 S. Ct. 400; Mo. Pac. Ry. v. Omaha, \n235 \nU.S. 121, 127\n, 35 S. Ct. 82; Erie R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Com'rs, \n254 \nU.S. 394, 409\n, 412 S., 41 S. Ct. 169. And such costs are not included in the just compensation which the railroad companies are entitled to receive. Cincinnati, I. & W. Ry. v. Connersville, \n218 \nU.S. 336, 343\n, 31 S. Ct. 93, 20 Ann. Cas. 1206; Chi., Mil. & St. P. Ry. v. Minneapolis, supra, 440 (34 S. Ct. 400). If the enforcement of its provisions operates to hamper the state's power reasonably to regulate the construction and use of the Comanche avenue crossing, then undoubtedly the ordinance is void. Chicago & Alton R. R. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67, 76\n, 35 S. Ct. 678; Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 34 S. Ct. 364; Denver & R. G. R. R. Co. v. Denver, \n250 \nU.S. 241, 244\n, 39 S. Ct. 450.\n The precise question is whether the agreement of the city to bear the cost of construction is inconsistent with the proper exertion of the police power. \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 308]\n\u00a0\n When the ordinance was passed, it was the purpose of the parties to get rid of unauthorized crossings then in use and to arrange for the extension of platted streets across the tracks and station grounds. It was necessary for the city to obtain rights of way for that purpose, and it was empowered to acquire them by contract, purchase or condemnation. Sections 11, 14, c. 517, 30 Stat. 498, 499; Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas (1884)  749, 760, 907-912. It could not take them without making just compensation to the owner. The company owned its right of way lands and station grounds in fee. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Roberts, \n152 \nU.S. 114\n, 14 S. Ct. 496. It was entitled to compensation for any of its property that might be taken or damaged by the construction and use of the crossings. Chieago, Burlington, etc., R. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 251\n, 17 S. Ct. 581; Cincinnati, I. & W. Ry. v. Connersville, supra.\n The ordinance did not purport to limit the number of crossings that might be opened. Retention by the company of the right to resort to litigation to determine whether the opening of additional streets across the railroad is reasonably necessary does not at all impinge upon police power. Quite independently of the ordinance the opening and regulation of such crossings is subject to judicial scrutiny, and action that is arbitrary or capricious will be held invalid. Denver & R. G. R. R. Co. v. Denver, supra, 244 (39 S. Ct. 450). Indeed the reservation contemplates the exertion of the police power and plainly implies that the parties did not intend to restrict the authority of the city to open crossings.\n The agreement of the city to pay the amounts stipulated for the opening of certain crossings does not involve or contemplate any surrender of the power of eminent domain. It was authorized to contract, purchase, or condemn as it saw fit. The opinion of the state court rightly approves amicable settlement of the compensa- \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 309]\n\u00a0\n tion to be given the owner. The parties were not bound to resort to litigation. It was competent for them in advance to settle the form and amount of compensation. The company's agreement to grand a right of way for the crossing was a valid consideration for the city's undertaking to bear the cost of construction.\n This case is not like Northern Pacific Railroad v. Duluth, supra, cited by defendants in error. There the city had the right of way for the street, and a grade crossing existed for many years. The elimination of that crossing became necessary. The company refused to comply with the city's demands in that respect. Then a contract was made. The city agreed to build a bridge to carry the street over the railroad tracks and the company agreed to contribute $50,000 to its cost. The city undertook to maintain the bridge over the tracks for 15 years and to maintain the approaches perputually. The city built the bridge at a cost of $23,000 in addition to the amount paid by the company. Years later, when repairs were needed, the company refused to make them. This court, following the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court (98 Minn. 429, 108 N. W. 269), held that the contract was without consideration, against public policy, and void. The Northern Pacific Company gave up nothing. The city already had the right of way. The company might have been required to build the bridge. The contract relieved it of a part of the cost, and attempted for all time to suspend the proper exertion of the police power in respect of maintenance. The ordinance now before us is very different from the situation and contract considered in that case.\n There is nothing in the ordinance that involves any attempt to interfere with or hinder the proper exertion of police power. Evidently it was the intention of the parties to make a permanent settlement in respect of the crossings covered by the ordinance. The city was em- \n\n[271 U.S. 303, 310]\n\u00a0\n powered to open the Comanche avenue crossing at any time without condemnation or other proceedings. Neither party could terminate the contract without the consent of the other. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsyvania Co., 129 F. 849, 862, 64 C. C. A. 285, 68 L. R. A. 968. The city's agreement to bear the cost of construction of the Comanche avenue crossing does not infringe the police power. The enforcement of the commission's order would deprive plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law and would impair the obligation of the contract in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v. FIDELITY & DEPOSIT CO.(1926)\nNo. 185\nArgued: October 12, 1926Decided: November 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n Miss Grace E. Smith, of Salem, Or., for appellant.\n Mr. John S. Coke, of Portland, Or., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Three companies licensed to do business in Oregon brought this suit against its insurance commissioner in the federal court for that state. The bill alleges that a former commissioner had authorized these companies to issue indemnity bonds, commonly called 'confiscation coverage,' by which those who sell automobiles on conditional sale are insured against loss arising from their confiscation for violation of law; that the defendant has entered an order canceling this authorization, on the ground that insurance of this nature is void as against public policy, because it serves to encourage the transportation of intoxicating liquors in violation of law; and that he has threatened to annul the plaintiffs' licenses unless they refrain entirely from writing such indemnity \n\n[272 U.S. 317, 319]\n\u00a0\n bonds. The bill charges that the defendant's action is in excess of the powers conferred upon him by the statutes of the state, and that his wrongful acts will, unless restrained, deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The bill prays for both a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\n The defendant moved to dismiss the bill, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The motion was overruled. An answer was filed. Parts of it were stricken out on plaintiff's motion. What remained admitted substantially all the allegations of the bill. The case was then heard further by a single judge, who on May 18, 1925, entered a final decree for an injunction. The constitutional question presented by the bill was not passed upon. The decision was rested solely upon the ground that the order complained of was in excess of the powers conferred by the statutes upon the insurance commissioner. 3 F.(2d) 652. An appeal to this court was allowed by the District Judge. A motion having been made to advance the case for argument, this court, of its own motion, entered a rule that the appellant show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in this court. Upon return to the rule, the case was set for argument.\n The bill invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court on the ground of diversity of citizenship, as well as on the ground that plaintiffs' constitutional rights were threatened. Although the constitutional question raised was not passed upon by the District Court, the allegations of the bill would have supplied the basis for a direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code, before that section was amended by Act Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (Comp. St.  1215). Compare Winchester v. Winchester Waterworks, \n251 \nU.S. 192, 193\n, 43 S. Ct. 123. But section 238 was so far changed by that act that now there is no right to a \n\n[272 U.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n direct appeal on constitutional grounds alone; the right exists now only in cases falling within the provisions enumerated in that section as amended. Otherwise the case must go in the first instance to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and may come here only for review of that court's action. See Application of Burder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n, 46 S. Ct. 557\n\n\n The act of 1925 applies, as the decree of which review is sought was entered after May 13, 1925. Among the provisions enumerated in section 238 as amended is section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). It is contended that this case falls within the latter section. It was amended by the addition of the following provision:\n'The requirement respecting the presence of three judges shall also apply to the final hearing in such suit in the district court; and a direct appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction in such suit.'\n\n Appellant contends that this appeal lies under section 266, because the order of the insurance commissioner is an order of an administrative board, and the suit is one which seeks relief by way of 'interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement ... of an order made by an administrative board ... acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such state, ... upon the ground of unconstitutionality. ...'\n In the case at bar there was an attack upon the order of the insurance commissioner 'upon the ground of unconstitutionality,' within the meaning of section 266. Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 292\n, 43 S. Ct. 353. It may be assumed that the order was action of an administrative board within the meaning of that section. Compare Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, \n270 \nU.S. 426\n, 46 S. Ct. 331. But the prayer for a preliminary injunction was not pressed, nor was there any request that the case be heard by a court consisting of three judges, which would have been necessary under section 266, if the prayer had been pressed. That section as originally enacted applied only where interlocutory relief was actually sought, regardless of the \n\n[272 U.S. 317, 321]\n\u00a0\n scope of the bill. Its purpose was to minimize, in an important class of cases, the delay incident to a review of a decree granting or denying an interlocutory injunction. The general purpose of the act of 1925 was to relieve this court by limiting further the absolute right to a review by it. There is nothing in the provision added by that act to section 266 which indicates a purpose to extend the application of that section-either as to the requirement of three judges or as to the right to a direct appeal-to a case in which an interlocutory injunction was not actually applied for. The occasion for the provision was considered in the Buder Case. It authorizes a direct appeal to this court from the final decree of the District Court only where an application was made for an interlocutory injunction and the case was heard before three judges.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v.

The members of the New Cotton Exchange, which is organized under a special act of the New York Legislature (chapter 365, p. 724, Laws 1871), also make contracts for the purchase and sale of cotton for further delivery, either for themselves or for customers; such contracts being made only upon open viva voce bidding, between certain hours of the day and in the rooms of the exchange in New York City. Quotations of prices thus established are collected by the New York exchange, and, under the terms of a written agreement with that exchange, the Western Union company pays $27,500 annually for the privilege of receiving and distributing them throughout the United States, to such persons as the exchange approves. Applicants for such quotations must sign an application and agree not to \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 602]\n\u00a0\n use them in connection with a bucket shop or to give them out to other persons. The Gold & Stock Telegraph Company, a New York corporation and a subsidiary of, and controlled by, the Western Union, is engaged in disseminating quotations of cotton prices by means of ticker service, owned and operated by it, tickers being located in exchanges, brokerage houses, and elsewhere in the several states. The Odd-Lot Exchange made application to the two telegraph companies for this service in the form required by the contract with the New York exchange. It was refused; the New York exchange having declined to give its consent to the installation on the ground, among others, that, after investigation, it had ascertained that the Odd-Lot had succeeded another exchange, which had been convicted of conducting a bucket shop, and that the Odd-Lot had in its membership many members of the convicted exchange, and was organized as a cover to enable its members to engage in the same unlawful business.\n Federal jurisdiction is invoked under the anti-trust laws of the United States. The bill avers that the contracts between members of the Odd-Lot are chiefly for producers of cotton and others located, resident and in business in other states than New York, and are made and effectuated by communications through the Western Union by wire; that such contracts concern and include deliveries of cotton from cotton-growing states to and into the state of New York, involving actual interstate shipment and transportation; that the New York exchange has a monopoly upon the receipt and dissemination of cotton price quotations, through which quotations and prices of cotton, both spot and for future delivery, are influenced, guided, and fixed in the exchanges and markets throughout the United States; that the contract with the Western Union is in restraint of interstate trade and commerce in cotton, and was entered into for \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 603]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of monopolizing and restraining that commerce. There is an attempt to allege unfair methods of competition, which may be put aside at once, since relief in such cases under the Trade Commission Act (Comp. St. ss 8836a-8836k) must be afforded in the first instance by the commission.\n The prayer is for a decree canceling the Western Union contract, adjudging the New York Cotton Exchange to be a monopoly, restraining appellees from refusing to install a ticker and furnish the Odd-Lot and its members, as they do others, with continuous cotton quotations, and for other relief.\n The answer, in addition to denials and affirmative defensive matter, sets up a counterclaim to the effect that the Odd-Lot, though it had been refused permission to use the quotations of the New York exchange, was purloining them, or receiving them from some person who was purloining them, and giving them out to its members, who were distributing them to bucket ships, with the consequent impairment of the value of appellees' property therein. An injunction against the continuance of this practice was asked.\n Both parties moved for interlocutory injunctions. The district court denied appellant's motion and granted that of appellees. 291 F. 681. Upon appeal, both orders were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 296 F. 61. By stipulation of the parties authorizing such action, the Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the cause, with directions to the District Court to enter a final decree dismissing the bill and making permanent the injunction granted appellees. Since this left to the District Court only the ministerial duty of complying with the mandate, the decree below, for purposes of appeal, is final. Gulf Refining Co. v. United States, 46 S. Ct. 52, \n269 U.S. 125\n, 136.\n First. We are of opinion that upon the allegations of the bill no case is made under the federal anti-trust laws. \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 604]\n\u00a0\n The only possible ground on which the suit can be maintained rests in the claim that there is a violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti- Trust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St. ss 8820, 8821), for which appellant is entitled to sue under section 16 of the Clayton Act, c. 323, 38 Stat. 737 (Comp. St. s 8835o). And whether this claim is tenable turns alone upon the effect of the contract between the New York exchange and the Western Union. Independent of that contract, there is no averment of fact in the bill upon which a violation of the Anti-Trust Act can be predicated. The New York exchange is engaged in a local business. Transactions between its members are purely local in their inception and in their execution. They consist of agreements made on the spot for the purchase and sale of cotton for future delivery, with a provision that such cotton must be represented by a warehouse receipt issued by a licensed ware-house in the Port of New York and be deliverable from such warehouse. Such agreements do not provide for, nor does it appear that they contemplate, the shipment of cotton from one state to another. If interstate shipments are actually made, it is not because of any contractual obligation to that effect; but it is a chance happening which cannot have the effect of converting these purely local agreements or the transactions to which they relate into subjects of interstate commerce. Ware & Leland Co. v. Mobile County, 28 S. Ct. 526, \n209 \nU.S. 405, 412\n, 413 S., 14 Ann. Cas. 1031. The most that can be said is that the agreements are likely to give rise to interstate shipments. This is not enough. Engel v. O'Malley, 31 S. Ct. 190, \n219 U.S. 128\n, 139. See also Hopkins v. United States, 19 S. Ct. 40, \n171 \nU.S. 578, 588\n, 590 S.; Anderson v. United States, 19 S. Ct. 50, \n171 \nU.S. 604, 615\n, 616 S..\n It is equally clear that the contract with the Western Union for the distribution of the quotations to such persons as the New York exchange shall approve does not fall within the reach of the Anti-Trust Act. Under that contract, the exchange at its own expense collects the quo- \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 605]\n\u00a0\n tations and delivers them to the telegraph company for distribution to such approved persons. The real distributor is the exchange; the telegraph company is an agency through which the distribution is made. In effect, the exchange hands over the quotations, as it might any other message, to the telegraph company for transmission, charges to be collected from the receivers. The payment which the telegraph company makes to the exchange is for the privilege of having the business. It does not alter the character of the service rendered.\n In furnishing the quotations to one and refusing to furnish them to another, the exchange is but exercising the ordinary right of a private vendor of news or other property. As a common carrier of messages for hire, the telegraph company, of course, is bound to carry for alike. But it cannot be required-indeed, it is not permitted-to deliver messages to others than those designated by the sender. We fully agree with what is said upon similar facts by Judge Ingraham in Matter of Renville, 61 N. Y. S. 549, 554, 46 App. Div. 37, 43, 44:\n'I cannot see that it makes any difference whether a dispatch is given to a telegraph company to be communicated to a single individual, or to be communicated to ten, a hundred or a thousand individuals. Under this agreement between the stock exchange and the respondents, certain information is given to the telegraph company to be communicated to individuals or corporations designated by the Stock Exchange. Whether we call this information a special dispatch or general information which the Stock Exchange desires to communicate, seems to me to be entirely immaterial. The fact that the telegraph company pays to the stock exchange a certain sum of money for the information which it receives to transmit is also immaterial. The substance is that those to whom this information is directed to be given by the stock exchange are willing to pay the Stock Exchange for such \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 606]\n\u00a0\n information, and are also willing to pay the telegraph company the expense of transmitting the information. The information delivered to the respondents for transmission is a communication which the Stock Exchange wishes to transmit to the persons it designates and to no one else. I can see no reason why the Stock Exchange should be required to furnish the appellant with this information, which relates solely to its own business upon its own property, or why the respondents should be required to violate their agreement with the Stock Exchange and the law of this state, and furnish to the appellant information which had been communicated to the respondents by the Stock Exchange for a specific purpose and none other.'\n\n So far as the exchange is concerned, the evident purpose of the contract was to further and protect its business. The terms are entirely appropriate and legitimate to that end. The effect of the making and execution of the contract upon interstate trade or commerce, if any, is indirect and incidental. Neither in purpose nor effect does it directly or unreasonably restrain such commerce or operate to create a monopoly. It has long been settled by this court that under such circumstances a trader or manufacturer engaged in a purely private business may freely exercise his independent discretion in respect of the persons with whom he will deal and to whom he will sell and refuse to sell. Cases to this effect are cited in the opinion of the court below. It is unnecessary to repeat, or add to, those citations here. It is enough to refer to the decision of this court in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., 25 S. Ct. 637, \n198 \nU.S. 236, 250\n, 252 S., where, in all essential particulars, the question now under review was presented and determined. There a suit was brought by the Board of Trade to enjoin the defendants from getting and distributing price quotations on sales of grain and provisions for future delivery. They were \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 607]\n\u00a0\n obtained in some way not disclosed, but not from either of the telegraph companies authorized by contract to distribute them, as the Western Union was authorized here. This court held that the collection of quotations belonged to the board and was entitled to protection; that the board did not lose its rights by communicating the information to others in confidential relations to it and under contract not to make it public; and that defendants should be enjoined. Holding the contracts with the telegraph companies not to be in conflict with the Anti-Trust Act, it was said (page 252 (25 S. Ct. 640)):\n'But so far as these contracts limit the communication of what the plaintiff might have refrained from communicating to any one, there is no monopoly or attempt at monopoly, and no contract in restraint of trade, either under the statute or at common law. Bement v. National Harrow Co. (22 S. Ct. 747), \n186 U.S. 70\n (46 L. Ed. 1058); Fowle v. Park (9 S. Ct. 658), \n131 U.S. 88\n (33 L. Ed. 67); Elliman v. Carrington (1901), 2 Ch. 275. It is argued that the true purpose is to exclude all persons who do not deal through members of the Board of Trade. Whether there is anything in the law to hinder these regulations being made with that intent we shall not consider, as we do not regard such a general scheme as shown by the contracts or proved. A scheme to exclude bucket shops is shown and proclaimed, no doubt-and the defendants, with their contention as to the plaintiff, call this an attempt at a monopoly in bucket shops. But it is simply a restraint on the acquisition for illegal purposes of the fruits of the plaintiff's work. Central Stock & Grain Exchange v. Board of Trade (63 N. E. 740), 196 Ill. 396. We are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction as prayed.'\n\n Second. The decree granting an injunction upon the counterclaim is challenged on the grounds, shortly stated: (1) That the court, having dismissed the bill for lack of jurisdictional facts, should have dismissed the counter \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 608]\n\u00a0\n claim also, there being no independent basis of jurisdiction; (2) that the counterclaim does not arise out of any transaction which is the subject- matter of the suit; and (3) that the decree is not justified by the allegations of the counterclaim or the proof.\n\n 1. \nWe do not understand that the dismissal was for the reason that there was an absence of jurisdiction to entertain the bill. What the court held was that the facts alleged were insufficient to establish a case under the Anti-Trust Act. Whether the objection that a bill of complaint does not state a case within the terms of a federal statute challenges the jurisdiction or goes only to the merits, is not always easy to determine. The question has been recently reviewed at some length by this court in Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 44 S. Ct. 96, 98, \n263 U.S. 291\n, 305 (68 L. Ed. 308), and the distinction pointed out as follows:\n'Jurisdiction is the power to decide a justiciable controversy, and includes questions of law as well as of fact. A complaint setting forth a substantial claim under a federal statute presents a case within the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court; and this jurisdiction cannot be made to stand or fall upon the way the court may chance to decide an issue as to the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged any more than upon the way it may decide as to the legal sufficiency of the facts proven. Its decision either way upon either question is predicated upon the existence of jurisdiction, not upon the absence of it. Jurisdiction, as distinguished from merits, is wanting only where the claim set forth in the complaint is so unsubstantial as to be frivolous or, in other words, is plainly without color of merit (citing cases). In that event the claim of federal right under the statute, is a mere pretense and, in effect, is no claim at all.'\n\n Here facts are set forth in a serious attempt to justify the claim that the federal statute has been violated, and, while we hold them to be insufficient to sustain the claim, \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 609]\n\u00a0\n we are not prepared to say that they are so obviously insufficient as to cause it to be without color of merit and in effect no claim at all. We think there is enough in the bill to call for the exercise of the jurisdiction of a federal court to decide, upon the merits, the issue of the issue of the legal sufficiency of the allegations to make out the claim of federal right. This was evidently the view of the court below, and we construe it mandate as a direction to dismiss the bill on the merits and not for want of jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nEquity rule 30 in part provides:\n'The answer must state in short and simple form any counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit, and may, without cross-bill, set up any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him, and such set-off or counterclaim, so set up, shall have the same effect as a cross-suit, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final decree in the same suit on both the original and the cross-claims.'\n\n Two classes of counterclaims thus are provided for: (a) One 'arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit,' which must be pleaded; and (b) another 'which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity' and which may be brought forward at the option of the defendant. We are of opinion that this counterclaim comes within the first branch of the rule, and we need not consider the point that, under the second branch, federal jurisdiction independent of the original bill must appear, as was held in Cleveland Engineering Co. v. Galion D. M. Truck Co. (D. C.) 243 F. 405, 407.\n The bill sets forth the contract with the Western Union and the refusal of the New York exchange to allow appellant to receive the continuous cotton quotations, and asks a mandatory injunction to compel appellees to furnish them. The answer admits the refusal and justifies it. The counterclaim sets up that, nevertheless, appellant is \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 610]\n\u00a0\n purloining or otherwise illegally obtaining them, and asks that this practice be enjoined. 'Transaction' is a word of flexible meaning. It may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship. The refusal to furnish the quotations is one of the links in the chain which constitutes the transaction upon which appellant here bases its cause of action. It is an important part of the transaction constituting the subject-matter of the counterclaim. It is the one circumstance without which neither party would have found it necessary to seek relief. Essential facts alleged by appellant enter into and constitute in part the cause of action set forth in the counterclaim. That they are not precisely identical, or that the counterclaim embraces additional allegations, as, for example, that appellant is unlawfully getting the quotations, does not matter. To hold otherwise would be to rob this branch of the rule of all serviceable meaning, since the facts relied upon by the plaintiff rarely, if ever, are, in all particulars, the same as those constituting the defendant's counterclaim. Compare the Xenia Branch Bank v. Lee, 7 Abb. Prac. (N. Y.) 372, 390, 394. And see, generally, Cleveland Engineering Co. v. Galion D. M. Truck Co., supra, page 408; Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Ignition Co. (D. C.) 247 F. 200, 203, 205.\n So close is the connection between the case sought to be stated in the bill and that set up in the counterclaim, that it only needs the failure of the former to establish a foundation for the latter; but the relief afforded by the dismissal of the bill is not complete without an injunction restraining appellant from continuing to obtain by stealthy appropriation what the court had held it could not have by judicial compulsion.\n\n 3. \nFinally, the point is made that the court of appeals erred in directing the District Court to enter a final decree making permanent the interlocutory injunction granted \n\n[270 U.S. 593, 611]\n\u00a0\n on the counterclaim because not warranted by the allegations or proof. Evidently for the purpose of facilitating an appeal to this court, appellant, by stipulation, consented that the affidavits filed in support of the preliminary application should be treated as testimony in support of the counterclaim and, on this, that the court of appeals might direct the entry of a final decree. The district court thought the pleadings and affidavits sufficient to warrant a preliminary injunction and the court of appeals thought them sufficient to sustain a decree making that injunction permanent. We see no reason to differ with their conclusions.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORRIS v. DUBY(1926)\nNo. 372\nArgued: Decided: October 29, 1926\n\n\n Messrs.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frank A. Bernero, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner libeled the Northern Star alleging a lien for repairs furnished in New York, the home port of the vessel. The intervener, Luber, set up a mortgage from the owner, the American Star Line, Inc., for over a million dollars, and the question here is which is entitled to priority. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals decided in favor of the mortgage. 295 F. 366, 7 F.(2d) 505. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n268 \nU.S. 683\n, 45 S. Ct. 509\n\n\n The mortgage, originally given to the United States when the ship was purchased, was executed and recorded on August 11, 1920, and a certified copy was left and kept with the ship's papers from September 23, 1920, but it was not indorsed upon the ship's papers until June 27, 1921. The repairs were made between November 14 and November 7, 1920, at the owner's request. One of the covenants of the mortgage was not to suffer or permit to be continued any lien that might have priority over the mortgage, and in any event within fifteen days after the same became due to satisfy it. Another covenant, probably shaped before the then recent Ship Mortgage Act, \n\n[271 U.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n 1920, June 5, 1920, c. 250,  30, 41 Stat. 988, 1000 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 jjj et seq.), required the mortgagor to carry a certified copy of the mortgage with the ship's papers, and to take other appropriate steps to give notice that the owner had no right to permit to be imposed on the vessel any lien superior to the mortgage. On these facts we feel no doubt that the petitioner got a lien upon the ship, as was assumed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Ship Mortgage Act, subsection P, 41 Stat. 1005 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 ooo).\n The owner of course had 'authority to bind the vessel' by virtue of his title without the aid of statute. The only importance of the statute was to get rid of the necessity for a special contract or for evidence that credit was given to the vessel. Subsection R, being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 pp, it is true, after providing that certain officers shall be included among those presumed to have authority from the owner to create a lien for supplies goes on that 'nothing in this section shall be construed to confer a lien when the furnisher knew, or by exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained, that because of the terms of a charter party, agreement for sale of the vessel, or for any other reason, the person ordering the repairs, supplies, or other necessaries was without authority to bind the vessel therefor.' But even if this language be construed as dealing with anything more than the authority of a third person to represent the owner so as to create a lien, still when supplies are ordered by the owner the statute does not attempt to forbid a lien simply because the owner has contracted with a mortgagee not to give any paramount security on the ship. The most that such a contract can do is to postpone the claim of a party chargeable with notice of it to that of the mortgagee.\n The petitioner's lien was valid and on the other hand there is equally little doubt that the mortgage was valid as soon as it was executed and recorded, before the indorsement upon the ship's papers. This view seems to \n\n[271 U.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n us plainly to be taken in subsections C and D of the Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 kk, 8146 1\/4 kkk). So the question more precisely stated is whether the above-mentioned covenants postponed the lien to the mortgage security, as they would seem to do on the facts of the case but for the language of the statute that we shall quote.\n The statute, after requiring the instrument to be recorded in the office of the Collector of Customs of the port of documentation, in order to be valid against persons not having actual notice (subsection C), provides in subsection (D (a) that 'a valid mortgage which ... shall in addition have, in respect to such vessel and as of the date of the compliance with all the provisions of this subdivision, the preferred status given by the provisions of subsection M, if-(1) the mortgage is indorsed upon the vessel's documents in accordance with the provisions of this section,' with other conditions; (b) upon compliance with which the mortgage is called a 'preferred mortgage.' Then follows in (c) a statement of what shall be indorsed. By (d) the indorsement is to be made by the collector of customs of the port of documentation or by the collector of any port in which the vessel is found if so directed by the former, and no clearance is to be issued to the vessel until such indorsement is made. Subsection M, being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 nnn, gives priority to a preferred mortgage over all claims against the vessel 'except (1) preferred maritime liens and (2) expenses and fees allowed and costs taxed, by the court.' By (a) of the subsection \"preferred maritime lien' means (1) a lien arising prior in time to the recording and indorsement of a preferred mortgage in accordance with the provisions of this section.' Obviously the statute taken literally may work harshly if by any oversight or otherwise the collector does not do his duty, and excellent reasons could be found for charging the petitioner with notice of a document that both was recorded and was kept with the ship's papers. \n\n[271 U.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n But the words of the statute seem to us too clear to be escaped. The mortgage is made preferred only upon compliance with all the conditions specified, one of which is indorsement, and the maritime lien is preferred if it arises before the recording and indorsement of the mortgage. We see no room for construction, and there is nothing for the courts to do but to bow their heads and obey.\n Decree reversed.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:\n The repairs for which petitioner claims a lien were made at the vessel's home port, and there is nothing whatever to show any effort to bind her for their payment by special agreement. Under such circumstances the general maritime law gives no lien. If the repair company acquired one it arose from the provisions of the act of 1920, and not otherwise. While subsection P, section 30, of that act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 ooo), declares generally that any person furnishing repairs shall have a lien on the vessel without allegation or proof that credit was extended to her, subsection R of the same section, being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  8146 1\/4 pp, expressly provides that:\n'Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer a lien when the furnisher knew, or by exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained, that because of the terms of a charter party, agreement for sale of the vessel, or for any other reason, the person ordering the repairs, supplies or other necessaries was without authority to bind the vessel therefor.'\n\n When the petitioner furnished the repairs at the home port there was on the public record in the collector's office at that same port a duly authenticated bill of sale and a purchase-money mortgage (a copy of the latter was also on board), which disclosed an express agreement by the owner 'not to suffer nor permit to be continued any lien, incumbrance or charge which has or might have pri- \n\n[271 U.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n ority over this mortgage of the vessel.' The petitioner had easy access to these instruments, and by exercising slight diligence might have ascertained their contents. They deprived the owner of both right and authority, within the true intent of the statute, to create the lien now claimed by the repair company. The purpose of this enactment was to protect honest furnishers who exercise diligence, and not to offer a wide- opened door for crooked transactions.\n The trial judge held that under the circumstances the petitioner acquired no lien. I agree with him, and even venture to think that the argument in support of his conclusion cannot be vaporized by mere negation. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORSE v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 201\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 151, 152]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. D. Mitchell, Sol, Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States.\n Mr. Hohn H. Morse, pro se.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n John H. Morse, claiming that he had been illegally separated from the Civil Service of the United States, filed his petition in the Court of Claims for $4,000 for his salary. Upon a general traverse the case was heard and the court made findings of fact and entered judgment that the petition of the plaintiff should be dismissed on the merits. The judgment was entered on the 21st of January, 1924. On March 19, 1924, Morse filed a motion for a new trial. This motion was overruled by the court on May 4, 1924. On May 28, 1924, Morse presented a motion for leave to file a motion to amend the findings of fact. This motion for leave to file was overruled by the Court of Claims on June 2, 1924. On June 9, 1924, Morse presented a motion for leave to file a motion to reconsider and grant a new trial, and on the same day the Court of Claims overruled the motion for leave to file. On September 5, 1924, Morse made application for an appeal to this court. The Court of Claims allowed the appeal on October 13, 1924. At the time of allowing the appeal, the Court of Claims filed a memorandum, calling attention to the dates upon which the steps referred to above had occurred and to the rule of the Court of Claims on the subject, and added:\n'In this state of the record the court is in doubt whether an appeal is allowable, but grants the appeal to give plaintiff the benefit of any doubt upon the question.' \n\n[270 U.S. 151, 153]\n\u00a0\n Rule 90 of the Court of Claims provides as follows:\n\n'Whenever it is desired to question the correctness or the sufficiency of the court's findings of fact or its conclusions or to amend the same, the complaining party shall file a motion which shall be known and maybe considered as a motion for a new trial. All grounds relied upon for any or all of said objects shall be included in one motion. After the court has announced its decision upon such motion no other motion by the same party shall be filed unless by leave of court. Motions for new trial, except as provided by section 1088 of the Revised Statutes (section 175 of the Judicial Code) shall be filed within sixty days from the time the judgment of the court is announced.'\n\n Section 243 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1220), which was in force at the time the appeal herein was taken, but which was later repealed by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, provided as follows:\n'All appeals from the Court of Claims shall be taken within ninety days after the judgment is rendered, and shall be allowed under such regulations as the Supreme Court may direct.'\n\n It is clear from the sequence of detes above given that more than 90 days elapsed between the overruling of the motion for a new trial and application for appeal by the appellant. The appellant contends that the motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial on June 9, 1924, prevented the beginning of the period of limitation within which application for an appeal could be made to the judgment of the Court of Claims, and therefore that the appeal taken on the 5th of September was within the statutory 90 days.\n There is no doubt under the decisions and practice in this court that where a motion for a new trial in a court of law, or a petition for a rehearing in a court of equity, is duly and seasonably filed, it suspends the running of the time for taking a writ of error or an appeal, and that the time within which the proceeding to review must be \n\n[270 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n initiated begins from the date of the denial of either the motion or petition.

The suspension of the running of the period limited for the allowance of an appeal, after a judgment has been entered, depends upon the due and seasonable filing of the motion for a new trial or the petition for rehearing. In this case after the first motion for a new trial had been overruled, on May 4, 1924, no motion for a new trial could be duly and seasonably filed under rule 90 of the Court of Claims, except upon leave of the Court of Claims. This leave, though applied for twice, was not granted. Applications for leave did not suspend the running of the 90 days after the denial of the motion for a new trial within which the application for appeal must have been made. For that reason, the motion of the government to dismiss the appeal as not in time, and so for\n Appeal dismisses. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOTTRAM v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 142\nArgued: January 15, 1926Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Jennings C. Wise, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff filed his petition claiming 44,773. 16s. 3d. damages because of failure of the United States to de- \n\n[271 U.S. 15, 16]\n\u00a0\n liver him certain steam packing for which he bid at an auction sale of surplus war materials held at Slough, England. The Court of Claims made findings of fact and gave judgment for the United States dismissing the petition.\n By an Act of Congress approved May 10, 1918, c. 70, 40 Stat. 548 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6941a), the President was authorized to sell property acquired in connection with the prosecution of the war. Pursuant to that act, an agreement was made by an army contracting officer, acting for the United States, with J. G. White & Co., Limited, of London, by which the latter agreed to sell at auction engineers' stores and equipment enumerated and described in an inventory compiled by such officer. The selling agents agreed to employ the auctioneer and other persons required to prepare and distribute catalogues and to conduct the sale. They employed an auctioneer to sell the stores and equipment at the United States Engineers' Depot at Slough, and advertised an auction sale to be held at that place on June 24, 1919, and days following. They issued a catalogue purporting to contain a list giving descriptions and quantities of the things to be sold. It showed that the United State was vendor, and specified that:\n'The whole shall be sold, with all faults, imperfections, errors of description, in the lots of the catalogue ... and without any warranty whatever, the buyers being held to have satisfied themselves as to the condition, quality, and description of the lots before bidding. ...'\n\n There were listed 22 lots of steam packing, and 11 of these were described as Garlock packing. Due to an error in transcribing a list furnished by the officer in command at the depot, the quantity of each lot of Garlock packing was expressed in hundredweights instead of pounds, and so indicated one hundred times the quantities intended. Plaintiff received notice of the sale through the press and from the catalogue which was fur- \n\n[271 U.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n nished to him at his request by the auctioneer. He made many visits to the depot before the sale, and had full opportunity to ascertain the character and quantities of the property to be sold. At his request the Garlock packing was shown to him by one of the employees at the depot on the day before the sale. It was all housed together, and he had full opportunity to determine its quantity. He then had the catalogue which listed 278,432 pounds for sale. It would have required 560 cases to hold that amount and 15,000 cubic feet of space to house it. Such a quantity would have supplied the needs of Great Britain for that article for 20 years. June 25, 1919, the plaintiff attended the sale as a bidder. And when the Garlock packing was offered, and after the question of the quantity of such packing had been raised and the auctioneer had stated that he would not guarantee any quantity, the plaintiff bid three and onefourth pence per pound for the lots of Garlock packing shown by the catalogue to amount in all to 278,432 pounds, and these lots were knocked down to him at that price.\n The auctioneer did not know that a mistake had been made in the catalogue, and sent plaintiff a bill which included the amount bid for the packing. June 30, 1919, plaintiff sent a check for the amount of the bill to the sales agents. The same day he gave to one Davies an option to buy from 50 to 90 tons of the packing. The option contained the following clause: 'Subject to the quantity being in stock as sold by the U. S. A.' When the sales agents received the check, they knew that there was no such quantity of steam packing at the depot. July 4, 1919, plaintiff was notified that a mistake had been made and that no such quantity had ever been at the depot. He then wrote the sales agents that he expected delivery of the quantity for which he had paid. \n\n[271 U.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n They answered explaining the mistake, and stated that they considered the explanation sufficient to close the incident with the return of the money. Plaintiff replied that he would hold them to the contract, and afterwards he made demands for delivery of the quantity erroneously stated in the catalogue. Delivery was refused on the ground that the quantity demanded had never been in existence. Under an arrangement that it was done without prejudice to either party, there was returned to the plaintiff the amount paid by him according to his bid for the packing.\n It was not the purpose of the United States to sell any property other than that belonging to it and then at its depot at Slough; and the facts found show that plaintiff so understood when he made his bid. The authority to sell conferred by Congress was limited to property acquired for the prosecution of the war. More than seven months had elapsed after the Armistice; a large part of the American Expeditionary Forces had been withdrawn from Europe, and the United States was disposing of its surplus war supplies there. Plaintiff was warned by the statement in the catalogue that the sales were to be held subject to errors of description and were to be made without any warranty He went to see the packing and had opportunity to determine quantities. It was obvious that the amount stated in the catalogue was erroneous and enormously in excess of that on hand. Plaintiff made his bid after the auctioneer had stated that he would not guarantee any quantity of Garlock packing. And the clause in the option to Davies shows that he was not relying on the statement of quantity in the catalogue.\n It is clear that the facts are sufficient to show that when plaintiff made his bid he was charged with knowledge that the United States was not offering for sale any such quantity of Garlock packing as stated in the catalogue. He was not entitled to a greater amount than the United \n\n[271 U.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n States had in the depot at Slough. There was no finding that delivery of that quantity was refused or that he was willing to accept it. He cannot recover. Lipshitz & Cohen v. United States, 46 S. Ct. 45, \n269 U.S. 90\n; Brawley v.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 443\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1926\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. Thomas Murphy and Vincent Murphy, pro se.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Thomas Murphy and Vincent Murphy were tried for maintaining a nuisance in violation of section 21, tit. 2, of the National Prohibition Act (Act Oct. 28, 1919, c. 85; 41 Stat. 305, 314 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 jj )) and were acquitted. Subsequently the United States brought a suit in equity to abate the same alleged nuisance under section 22 of the same title. At the trial the defendants proved their former acquittal and \n\n[272 U.S. 630, 631]\n\u00a0\n moved that the bill be dismissed. The District Court denied the motion and entered a decree abating the nuisance and enjoining the defendants from occupying or using the premises for one year. The defendants appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals certified to this court the question whether the former acquittal is a bar.\n By section 21 any room, house, or place where intoxicating liquor is manufactured, sold, or kept in violation of the statute is declared to be a common nuisance, and maintaining it is made a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. Then follows the section under which the defendants now are sued, authorizing a suit in equity for an injunction against the nuisance as defined. A temporary writ restraining the continuance of it until the conclusion of the trial is to be issued if it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court of judge in vacation that such nuisance exists. It is not necessary for the court to find that the property was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court 'shall order' that no liquors shall be manufactured, sold, or stored, etc., in the place; and upon judgment that the nuisance be abated, 'may order' that the place shall not be occupied or used for one year thereafter, but may permit it to be occupied if the owner or occupant gives a bond for not less than $500 nor more than $1,000, that intoxicating liquor will not thereafter be manufactured, sold, or kept, etc., therein, etc.\n The appellants say that an additional penalty is imposed by tit. 2, section 22 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 k), and that after they have been acquitted of the crime they cannot be punished for it in a second proceeding. Coffey v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 430\n, 6 S. Ct. 432. But although the contention is plausible it seems to us unsound. It is true, especially if the premises are closed for \n\n[272 U.S. 630, 632]\n\u00a0\n a year, that a pecuniary detriment is inflicted, but that is true of a tax, and sometimes it is hard to say how a given detriment imposed by the law shall be regarded. Hodge v. Muscatine County, \n196 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 280 S., 25 S. Ct. 237; St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 43 S. Ct. 125; The Creole, Fed. Cas. No. 13,033, 2 Wall. Jr. 485. The mere fact that it is imposed in consequence of a crime is not conclusive. A government may endeavor to prevent certain facts and yet provide that if they happen they shall yield as much revenue as they might have yielded if lawful. United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile (November 22, 1926), \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 71 L. Ed. -. In like manner it may provide for the abatement of a nuisance whether or not the owners of it have been guilty of a crime. The only question is what the twenty-second section is intended to accomplish. It appears to us that the purpose is prevention, not a second punishment that could not be inflicted after acquittal from the first. This seems to us to be shown by the whole scope of the section as well as by the unreasonableness of interpreting it as intended to accomplish a plainly unconstitutional result. The imperative words go only to the immediate stopping of what is clearly a nuisance. The permissive words allow closing for a year (a not unreasonable time to secure a stoppage of the unlawful use, United States v. Boynton (D. C.) 297 F. 261, 267), and show the purpose of that by providing the alternative of a bond conditioned against such uses.\n If we are right as to the purpose of section 22 the decree in the present case did not impose a punishment for the crime from which the appellants were acquitted by the former judgment. That it did impose a punishment is the only ground on which the former judgment would be a bar. For although the parties to the two cases are the same, the judgment in the criminal case does not make the issues in the present one res judicata, as is sufficiently explained in Stone v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 178\n, 17 S. Ct. 778, and \n\n[272 U.S. 630, 633]\n\u00a0\n Chantangco v. Abaroa, \n218 \nU.S. 476\n, 31 S. Ct. 34. The Government may have failed to prove the appellants guilty and yet may have been and may be able to prove that a nuisance exists in the place.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 77\nArgued: Decided: October 25, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Will R. King, of Portland, Or., and L. H. Cake, of Washington, D. C. (Martin L. Pipes, of Portland, Or., of counsel), for appellant.\n Mr. George Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., amicus curiae.\n Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of New York City, and Rebert P. Reeder, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 106]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether under the Constitution the President has the exclusive power of removing executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n Myers, appellant's intestate, was on July 21, 1917, appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to be a postmaster of the first class at Portland, Or., for a term of four years. On January 20, 1920, Myers' resignation was demanded. He refused the demand. On February 2, 1920, he was removed from office by order of the Postmaster General, acting by direction of the President. February 10th, Myers sent a petition to the President and another to the Senate committee on post offices, asking to be heard, if any charges were filed. He protested to the department against his removal, and continued to do so until the end of his term. He pursued no other occupation and drew compensation for no other service during the interval. On April 21, 1921, he brought this suit in the Court of Claims for his salary from the date of his removal, which, as claimed by supplemental petition filed after July 21, 1921, the end of his term, amounted to $8,838.71. In August, 1920, the President made a recess appointment of one Jones, who took office September 19, 1920. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 107]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Claims gave judgment against Myers and this is an appeal from that judgment. The court held that he had lost his right of action because of his delay in suing, citing Arant v. Lane, \n249 \nU.S. 367\n, 39 S. Ct. 293; Nicholas v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 71\n, 42 S. Ct. 7, and Norris v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 77\n, 42 S. Ct. 9. These cases show that when a United States officer is dismissed, whether in disregard of the law or from mistake as to the facts of his case, he must promptly take effective action to assert his rights. But we do not find that Myers failed in this regard. He was constant in his efforts at reinstatement. A hearing before the Senate committee could not be had till the notice of his removal was sent to the Senate or his successor was nominated. From the time of his removal until the end of his term, there were three sessions of the Senate without such notice or nomination. He put off bringing his suit until the expiration of the Sixty- Sixth Congress, March 4, 1921. After that, and three months before his term expired, he filed his petition. Under these circumstances, we think his suit was not too late. Indeed the Solicitor General, while not formally confessing error in this respect, conceded at the bar that no laches had been shown.\n By the sixth section of the Act of Congress of July 12, 1876, 19 Stat. 80, 81, c. 179 (Comp. St.  7190), under which Myers was appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate as a first-class postmaster, it is provided that:\n'Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law.'\n\n The Senate did not consent to the President's removal of Myers during his term. If this statute in its requirement that his term should be four years unless sooner removed by the President by and with the consent of the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 108]\n\u00a0\n Senate is valid, the appellant, Myers' administratrix, is entitled to recover his unpaid salary for his full term and the judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed. The government maintains that the requirement is invalid, for the reason that under article 2 of the Constitution the President's power of removal of executive officers appointed by him with the advice and consent of the Senate is full and complete without consent of the Senate. If this view is sound, the removal of Myers by the President without the Senate's consent was legal, and the judgment of the Court of Claims against the appellant was correct, and must be affirmed, though for a different reason from the given by that court. We are therefore confronted by the constitutional question and cannot avoid it.\n The relevant parts of article 2 of the Constitution are as follows:\n'Section 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. ...\n\n'Section 2. The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any subject relating to the Duties of their respective Officers, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\n\n'He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be estab- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 109]\n\u00a0\n lished by Law; but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n\n'The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\n\n'Section 3. He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.\n\n'Section 4. The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'\n\n Section 1 of article 3 provides:\n'The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the Supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior . ...'\n\n The question where the power of removal of executive officers appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate was vested, was presented early in the first session of the First Congress. There is no express provision respecting removals in the Constitution, except as section 4 of article 2, above quoted, provides for removal from office by impeachment. The subject \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 110]\n\u00a0\n was not discussed in the Constitutional Convention. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was given the power of appointing certain executive officers of the Confederation, and during the Revolution and while the articles were given effect, Congress exercised the power of removal. May, 1776, 4 Journals of the Continental Congress, Library of Congress Ed., 361; August 1, 1777, 8 Journals, 596; January 7, 1779, 13 Journals, 32-33; June, 1779, 14 Journals, 542, 712, 714; November 23, 1780, 18 Journals, 1085; December 1, 1780, 18 Journals, 1115\n\n\n Consideration of the executive power was initiated in the Constitutional Convention by the seventh resolution in the Virginia Plan introduced by Edmund Randolph. 1 Farrand. Records of the Federal Convention, 21. It gave to the executive 'all the executive powers of the Congress under the Confederation,' which would seem therefore to have intended to include the power of removal which had been exercised by that body as incident to the power of appointment. As modified by the committee of the whole this resolution declared for a national executive of one person to be elected by the Legislature, with power to carry into execution the national laws and to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for. It was referred to the committee on detail (1 Farrand, 230), which recommended that the executive power should be vested in a single person to be styled the President of the United States, that he should take care that the laws of the United States be duly and faithfully executed, and that he should commission all the officers of the United States and appoint officers in all cases not otherwise provided by the Constitution (2 Farrand, 185). The committee further recommended that the Senate be given power to make treaties, and to appoint ambassadors and judges of the Supreme Court.\n After the great compromises of the convention-the one giving the states equality of representation in the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 111]\n\u00a0\n Senate, and the other placing the election of the President, not in Congress, as once voted, but in an electoral college, in which the influence of larger states in the selection would be more nearly in proportion to their population-the smaller states led by Roger Sherman, fearing that under the second compromise the President would constantly be chosen from one of the larger states, secured a change by which the appointment of all officers, which theretofore had been left to the President without restriction, was made subject to the Senate's advice and consent, and the making of treaties and the appointments of ambassadors, public ministers, consuls, and judges of the Supreme Court were transferred to the President, but made subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. This third compromise was affected in a special committee in which Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania represented the larger states, and Roger Sherman the smaller states. Although adopted finally without objection by any state in the last days of the convention, members from the larger states, like Wilson and others, criticized this limitation of the President's power of appointment of executive officers and the resulting increase of the power of the Senate. 2 Farrand, 537, 538, 539.\n In the House of Representatives of the First Congress, on Tuesday, May 18, 1789, Mr. Madison moved in the committee of the whole that there should be established three executive departments, one of Foreign Affairs, another of the Treasury, and a third of War, at the head of each of which there should be a Secretary, to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and to be removable by the President. The committee agreed to the establishment of a Department of Foreign Affairs, but a discussion ensued as to making the Secretary removable by the President. 1 Annals of Congress, 370, 371. 'The question was now taken and carried, by a considerable majority, in favor \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 112]\n\u00a0\n of declaring the power of removal to be in the President.' 1 Annals of Congress, 383.\n On June 16, 1789, the House resolved itself into a committee of the whole on a bill proposed by Mr. Madison for establishing an executive department to be denominated the Department of Foreign Affairs, in which the first clause, after stating the title of the officer and describing his duties, had these words 'to be removable from office by the President of the United States.' 1 Annals of Congress, 455. After a very full discussion the question was put; Shall the words 'to be removable by the President' be struck out? It was determined in the negative-yeas 20, nays 34. 1 Annals of Congress, 576.\n On June 22, in the renewal of the discussion:\n'Mr. Benson moved to amend the bill, by altering the second clause, so as to imply the power of removal to be in the President alone. The clause enacted that there should be a chief clerk, to be appointed by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and employed as he thought proper, and who, in case of vacancy, should have the charge and custody of all records, books, and papers appertaining to the department. The amendment proposed that the chief clerk, 'whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States, or in any other case of vacancy,' should during such vacancy, have the charge and custody of all records, books, and papers appertaining to the department.' 1 Annals of Congress, 578.\n\n'Mr. Benson stated that his objection to the clause 'to be removable by the President' arose from an idea that the power of removal by the President hereafter might appear to be exercised by virtue of a legislative grant only, and consequently be subjected to legislative instability, when he was well satisfied in his own mind that it was fixed by a fair legislative construction of the Constitution.' 1 Annals of Congress, 579.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 113]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. Benson declared, if he succeeded in this amendment, he would move to strike out the words in the first clause, 'to be removable by the President,' which appeared somewhat like a grant. Now, the mode he took would evade that point and establish a legislative construction of the Constitution. He also hoped his amendment would succeed in reconciling both sides of the House to the decision, and quieting the minds of gentlemen.' 1 Annals of Congress, 578.\n Mr. Madison admitted the objection made by the gentleman near him (Mr. Benson) to the words in the bill. He said:\n'They certainly may be construed to imply a legislative grant of the power. He wished everything like ambiguity expunged, and the sense of the House explicitly declared, and therefore seconded the motion. Gentlemen have all along proceeded on the idea that the Constitution vests the power in the President, and what arguments were brought forward respecting the convenience or inconvenience of such disposition of the power were intended only to throw light upon what was meant by the compilers of the Constitution. Now, as the words proposed by the gentleman from New York expressed to his mind the meaning of the Constitution, he should be in favor of them, and would agree to strike out those agreed to in the committee.' 1 Annals of Congress, 578, 579.\n\n Mr. Benson's first amendment to alter the second clause by the insertion of the italicized words, made that clause read as follows:\n'That there shall be in the State Department an inferior officer to be appointed by the said principal officer, and to be employed therein as he shall deem proper, to be called the chief clerk in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and who, whenever the principal officers shall be removed from office by the President of the United States, or in any other case of vacancy, shall, during such va- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 114]\n\u00a0\n cancy, have charge and custody of all records, books and papers appertaining to said department.'\n\n The first amendment was then approved by a vote of 30 to 18. 1 Annals of Congress, 580. Mr. Benson then moved to strike out in the first clause the words 'to be removable by the President,' in pursuance of the purpose he had already declared, and this second motion of his was carried by a vote of 31 to 19. 1 Annals of Congress, 585.\n The bill as amended was ordered to be engrossed, and read the third time the next day, June 24, 1789, and was then passed by a vote of 29 to 22, and the clerk was directed to carry the bill to the Senate and desire their concurrence. 1 Annals of Congress, 591.\n It is very clear from this history that the exact question which the House voted upon was whether it should recognize and declare the power of the President under the Constitution to remove the Secretary of Foreign Affairs without the advice and consent of the Senate. That was what the vote was taken for. Some effort has been made to question whether the decision carries the result claimed for it, but there is not the slightest doubt. after an examination of the record, that the vote was, and was intended to be, a legislative declaration that the power to remove officers appointed by the President and the Senate vested in the President alone, and until the Johnson impeachment trial in 1868 its meaning was not doubted, even by those who questioned its soundness.\n The discussion was a very full one. Fourteen out of the 29 who voted for the passage of the bill and 11 of the 22 who voted against the bill took part in the discussion. Of the members of the House, 8 had been in the Constitutional Convention, and of these 6 voted with the majority, and 2, Roger Sherman and Elbridge Gerry, the latter of whom had refused to sign the Constitution, voted in the minority. After \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 115]\n\u00a0\n the bill as amended had passed the House, it was sent to the Senate, where it was discussed in secret session, without report. The critical vote there was upon the striking out of the clause recognizing and affirming the unrestricted power of the President to remove. The Senate divided by 10 to 10, requiring the deciding vote of the Vice President, John Adams, who voted against striking out, and in favor of the passage of the bill as it had left the House. \n1\n Ten of the Senators had been in the Constitutional Convention, and of them 6 voted that the power of removal was in the President alone. The bill, having passed as it came from the House, was signed by President Washington and became a law. Act July 27, 1789, 1 Stat. 28, c. 4.\n The bill was discussed in the House at length and with great ability. The report of it in the Annals of Congress is extended. James Madison was then a leader in the House, as he had been in the convention. His arguments in support of the President's constitutional power of removal independently of congressional provision, and without the consent of the Senate, were masterly, and he carried the House.\n It is convenient in the course of our discussion of this case to review the reasons advanced by Mr. Madison and his associates for their conclusion, supplementing them, so far as may be, by additional considerations which lead this court to concur therein.\n First. Mr. Madison insisted that article 2 by vesting the executive power in the President was intended to grant to him the power of appointment and removal of executive officers except as thereafter expressly provided in that article. He pointed out that one of the chief \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 116]\n\u00a0\n purposes of the convention was to separate the legislative from the executive functions. He said:\n'If there is a principle in our Constitution, indeed in any free Constitution more sacred than another, it is that which separates the legislative, executive and judicial powers. If there is any point in which the separation of the legislative and executive powers ought to be maintained with great caution, it is that which relates to officers and offices.' 1 Annals of Congress, 581.\n\n Their union under the Confederation had not worked well, as the members of the convention knew. Montesquieu's view that the maintenance of independence, as between the legislative, the executive and the judicial branches, was a security for the people had their full approval. Madison in the Convention, 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, 56. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 610. Accordingly the Constitution was so framed as to vest in the Congress all legislative powers therein granted, to vest in the President the executive power, and to vest in one Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress might establish the judicial power. From this division on principle, the reasonable construction of the Constitution must be that the branches should be kept separate in all cases in which they were not expressly blended, and the Constitution should be expounded to blend them no more than it affirmatively requires. Madison, 1 Annals of Congress, 497. This rule of construction has been confirmed by this court in Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 472\n, 515; Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 U.S. 168\n, 190; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 662\n, 8 S. Ct. 273.\n The debates in the Constitutional Convention indicated an intention to create a strong executive, and after a controversial discussion the executive power of the government was vested in one person and many of his important functions were specified so as to avoid the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 117]\n\u00a0\n humiliating weakness of the Congress during the Revolution and under the Articles of Confederation. 1 Farrand, 66-97.\n Mr. Madison and his associates in the discussion in the House dwelt at length upon the necessity there was for construing article 2 to give the President the sole power of removal in his responsibility for the conduct of the executive branch, and enforced this by emphasizing his duty expressly declared in the third section of the article to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' Madison, 1 Annals of Congress, 496, 497.\n The vesting of the executive power in the President was essentially a grant of the power to execute the laws. But the President alone and unaided could not execute the laws. He must execute them by the assistance of subordinates. This view has since been repeatedly affirmed by this court. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 513; United States v. Eliason, 16 Pet. 291, 302; Williams v. United States, 1 How. 290, 297; Cunningham v. Neagle, \n135 \nU.S. 1, 63\n, 10 S. Ct. 658; Russell Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 43 S. Ct. 428. As he is charged specifically to take care that they be faithfully executed, the reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that as part of his executive power he should select those who were to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws. The further implication must be, in the absence of any express limitation respecting removals, that as his selection of administrative officers is essential to the execution of the laws by him, so must be his power of removing those for whom he cannot continue to be responsible. Fisher Ames, 1 Anals of Congress, 474. It was urged that the natural meaning of the term 'executive power' granted the President included the appointment and removal of executive subordinates. If such appointments and removals were not an exercise of the executive power, what were they? They certainly \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 118]\n\u00a0\n were not the exercise of legislative or judicial power in government as usually understood.\n It is quite true that, in state and colonial governments at the time of the Constitutional Convention, power to make appointments and removals had sometimes been lodged in the Legislatures or in the courts, but such a disposition of it was really vesting part of the executive power in another branch of the government. In the British system, the crown, which was the executive, had the power of appointment and removal of executive officers, and it was natural, therefore, for those who framed our Constitution to regard the words 'executive power' as including both. Ex parte Grossman, \n267 \nU.S. 87, 110\n, 45 S. Ct. 332, 38 A. L. R. 131. Unlike the power of conquest of the British crown, considered and rejected as a precedent for us in Fleming v. Page, 9 How. 603, 618, the association of removal with appointment of executive officers is not incompatible with our republican form of government.\n The requirement of the second section of article 2 that the Senate should advise and consent to the presidential appointments, was to be strictly construed. The words of section 2, following the general grant of executive power under section 1, were either an enumeration and emphasis of specific functions of the executive, not all inclusive, or were limitations upon the general grant of the executive power, and as such, being limitations, should not be enlarged beyond the words used. Madison, 1 Annals, 462, 463, 464. The executive power was given in general terms strengthened by specific terms where emphasis was regarded as appropriate, and was limited by direct expressions where limitation was needed, and the fact that no express limit was placed on the power of removal by the executive was convincing indication that none was intended. This is the same construction of article 2 as that of Alexander Hamilton quoted infra. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 119]\n\u00a0\n Second. The view of Mr. Madison and his associates was that not only did the grant of executive power to the President in the first section of article 2 carry with it the power of removal, but the express recognition of the power of appointment in the second section enforced this view on the well-approved principle of constitutional and statutory construction that the power of removal of executive officers was incident to the power of appointment. It was agreed by the opponents of the bill, with only one or two exceptions, that as a constitutional principle the power of appointment carried with it the power of removal. Roger Sherman, 1 Annals of Congress, 491. This principle as a rule of constitutional and statutory construction, then generally conceded, has been recognized ever since. Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259; Reagan v. United States, \n182 \nU.S. 419\n, 21 S. Ct. 842; Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311, 315\n, 23 S. Ct. 535. The reason for the principle is that those in charge of and responsible for administering functions of government, who select their executive subordinates, need in meeting their responsibility to have the power to remove those whom they appoint.\n Under section 2 of article 2, however, the power of appointment by the executive is restricted in its exercise by the provision that the Senate, a part of the legislative branch of the government, may check the action of the executive by rejecting the officers he selects. Does this make the Senate part of the removing power? And this, after the whole discussion in the House is read attentively, is the real point which was considered and decided in the negative by the vote already given.\n The history of the clause by which the Senate was given a check upon the President's power of appointment makes it clear that it was not prompted by any desire to limit removals. As already pointed out, the important purpose of those who brought about the restriction was to lodge in the Senate, where the small states had equal \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 120]\n\u00a0\n representation with the larger states, power to prevent the President from making too many appointments from the larger states. Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, delegates from Connecticut, reported to its Governor: 'The equal representation of the states in the Senate and the voice of that branch in the appointment to offices will secure the rights of the lesser as well as of the greater states.' 3 Farrand, 99. The formidable opposition to the Senate's veto on the President's power of appointment indicated that in construing its effect, it should not be extended beyond its express application to the matter of appointments. This was made apparent by the remarks of Abraham Baldwin, of Georgia, in the debate in the First Congress. He had been a member of the Constitutional Convention. In opposing the construction which would extend the Senate's power to check appointments to removals from office, he said:\n'I am well authorized to say that the mingling of the powers of the President and Senate was strongly opposed in the convention which had the honor to submit to the consideration of the United States and the different States the present system for the government of the Union. Some gentlemen opposed it to the last, and finally it was the principal ground on which they refused to give it their signature and assent. One gentleman called it a monstrous and unnatural connection, and did not hesitate to affirm it would bring on convulsions in the government. This objection was not confined to the walls of the convention; it has been subject of newspaper declamation and perhaps justly so. Ought we not, therefore, to be careful not to extend this unchaste connection any further?' 1 Annals of Congress, 557.\n\n Madison said:\n'Perhaps there was no argument urged with more success or more plausibly grounded against the Constitution under which we are now deliberating than that founded \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 121]\n\u00a0\n on the mingling of the executive and legislative branches of the government in one body. It has been objected that the Senate have too much of the executive power even, by having control over the President in the appointment to office. Now shall we extend this connection between the legislative and executive departments which will strengthen the objection and diminish the responsibility we have in the head of the executive?' 1 Annals of Congress, 380.\n\n It was pointed out in this great debate that the power of removal, though equally essential to the executive power is different in its nature from that of appointment. Madison, 1 Annals of Congress, 497 et seq.; Clymer, 1 Annals, 489; Sedgwick, 1 Annals, 522; Ames, 1 Annals, 541, 542; Hartley, 1 Annals, 481. A veto by the Senate-a part of the legislative branch of the government-upon removals is a much greater limitation upon the executive branch, and a much more serious blending of the legislative with the executive, than a rejection of a proposed appointment. It is not to be implied. The rejection of a nominee of the President for a particular office does not greatly embarrass him in the conscientious discharge of his high duties in the selection of those who are to aid him, because the President usually has an ample field from which to select for office, according to his preference, competent and capable men. The Senate has full power to reject newly proposed appointees whenever the President shall remove the incumbents. Such a check enables the Senate to prevent the filling of offices with bad or incompetent men, or with those against whom there is tenable objection.\n The power to prevent the removal of an officer who has served under the President is different from the authority to consent to or reject his appointment. When a nomination is made, it may be presumed that the Senate is, or may become, as well advised as to the fitness of the nomi- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 122]\n\u00a0\n nee as the President, but in the nature of things the defects in ability or intelligence or loyalty in the administration of the laws of one who has served as an officer under the President are facts as to which the President, or his trusted subordinates, must be better informed than the Senate, and the power to remove him may therefor be regarded as confined for very sound and practical reasons, to the governmental authority which has administrative control. The power of removal is incident to the power of appointment, not to the power of advising and consenting to appointment, and when the grant of the executive power is enforced by the express mandate to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it emphasizes the necessity for including within the executive power as conferred the exclusive power of removal.\n Oliver Ellsworth was a member of the Senate of the First Congress, and was active in securing the imposition of the Senate restriction upon appointments by the President. He was the author of the Judiciary Act in that Congress (1 Stat. 73), and subsequently Chief Justice of the United States. His view as to the meaning of this article of the Constitution, upon the point as to whether the advice of the Senate was necessary to removal, like that of Madison, formed and expressed almost in the very atmosphere of the convention, was entitled to great weight. What he said in the discussion in the Senate was reported by Senator William Patterson ( 2 Bancroft, History of the Constitution of the United States, 192), as follows:\n'The three distinct powers, legislative, judicial and executive should be placed in different hands. 'He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed' are sweeping words. The officers should be attentive to the President to whom the Senate is not a council. To turn a man out of office is an exercise neither of legislative nor of judicial power; it is like a tree growing upon land that has been granted. The advice of the Senate does not make the appointment. The President appoints. There \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 123]\n\u00a0\n are certain restrictions in certain cases, but the restriction is as to the appointment, and not as to the removal.'\n\n In the discussion in the First Congress fear was expressed that such a constitutional rule of construction as was involved in the passage of the bill would expose the country to tyranny through the abuse of the exercise of the power of removal by the President. Underlying such fears was the fundamental misconception that the President's attitude in his exercise of power is one of opposition to the people, while the Congress is their only defender in the government, and such a misconception may be noted in the discussions had before this court. This view was properly contested by Mr. Madison in the discussion (1 Annals of Congress, 461), by Mr. Hartley (1 Annals, 481), by Mr. Lawrence (1 Annals, 485), and by Mr. Scott (1 Annals, 533). The President is a representative of the people, just as the members of the Senate and of the House are, and it may be at some times, on some subjects, that the President, elected by all the people, is rather more representative of them all than are the members of either body of the Legislature, whose constituencies are local and not country wide, and as the President is elected for four years, with the mandate of the people to exercise his executive power under the Constitution, there would seem to be no reason for construing that instrument in such a way as to limit and hamper that power beyond the limitations of it, expressed or fairly implied.\n Another argument advanced in the First Congress against implying the power of removal in the President alone from its necessity in the proper administration of the executive power was that all embarrassment in this respect could be avoided by the President's power of suspension of officers, disloyal or incompetent, until the Senate could act. To this, Mr. Benson, said:\n'Gentlemen ask, Will not the power of suspending an officer be sufficient to prevent malconduct? Here is some \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 124]\n\u00a0\n inconsistency in their arguments. They declare that Congress have no right to construe the Constitution in favor of the President, with respect to removal; yet they propose to give a construction in favor of the power of suspension being exercised by him. Surely gentlemen do not pretend that the President has the power of suspension granted expressly by the Constitution; if they do, they have been more successful in their researches into that instrument than I have been. If they are willing to allow a power of suspending, it must be because they construe some part of the Constitution in favor of such a grant. The construction in this case must be equally unwarrantable. But admitting it proper to grant this power, what then? When an officer is suspended, does the place become vacant? May the President proceed to fill it up? Or must the public business be likewise suspended? When we say an officer is suspended, it implies that the place is not vacant; but the parties may be heard, and, after the officer is freed from the objections that have been taken to his conduct, he may proceed to execute the duties attached to him. What would be the consequence of this? If the Senate, upon its meeting, were to acquit the officer, and replace him in his station, the President would then have a man forced on him whom he considered as unfaithful, and could not, consistent with his duty, and a proper regard to the general welfare, go so far as to intrust him with full communications relative to the business of his department. Without a confidence in the Executive Department, its operations would be subject to perpetual discord, and the administration of the government become impracticable.' 1 Annals of Congress, 506.\n\n Mr. Vining said:\n'The Departments of Foreign Affairs and War are peculiarly within the powers of the President, and he must be responsible for them; but take away his controlling power, and upon what principle do you require his responsibility?\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 125]\n\u00a0\n 'The gentlemen say the President may suspend. They were asked if the Constitution gave him this power any more than the other? Do they contend the one to be a more inherent power than the other? If they do not, why shall it be objected to us that we are making a Legislative construction of the Constitution. when they are contending for the same thing?' 1 Annals of Congress, 512.\n In the case before us, the same suggestion has been made for the same purpose, and we think it is well answered in the foregoing. The implication of removal by the President alone is no more a strained construction of the Constitution than that of suspension by him alone and the broader power is much more needed and more strongly to be implied.\n Third. Another argument urged against the constitutional power of the President alone to remove executive officers appointed by him with the consent of the Senate is that, in the absence of an express power of removal granted to the President, power to make provision for removal of all such officers is vested in the Congress by section 8 of article 1.\n Mr. Madison, mistakenly thinking that an argument like this was advanced by Roger Sherman, took it up and answered it as follows:\n'He seems to think (if I understand him rightly) that the power of displacing from office is subject to legislative discretion, because, it having a right to create, it may limit or modify as it thinks proper. I shall not say but at first view this doctrine may seem to have some plausibility. But when I consider that the Constitution clearly intended to maintain a marked distinction between the legislative, executive and judicial powers of government, and when I consider that, if the Legislature has a power such as is contended for, they may subject and transfer at discretion powers from one department of our government to another, they may, on that principle, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 126]\n\u00a0\n exclude the President altogether from exercising any authority in the removal of officers, they may give to the Senate alone, or the President and Senate combined, they may vest it in the whole Congress, or they may reserve it to be exercised by this house. When I consider the consequences of this doctrine, and compare them with the true principles of the Constitution, I own that I cannot subscribe to it . ...' 1 Annals of Congress, 495, 496.\n\n Of the 11 members of House who spoke from amongst the 22 opposing the bill, 2 insisted that there was no power of removing officers after they had been appointed, except by impeachment, and that the failure of the Constitution expressly to provide another method of removal involved this conclusion. Eight of them argued that the power of removal was in the President and Senate; that the House had nothing to do with it; and most of these were very insistent upon this view in establishing their contention that it was improper for the House to express in legislation any opinion on the constitutional question whether the President could remove without the Senate's consent.\n The constitutional construction that excludes Congress from legislative power to provide for the removal of superior officers finds support in the second section of article 2. By it the appointment of all officers, whether superior or inferior, by the President is declared to be subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. In the absence of any specific provision to the contrary, the power of appointment to executive office carries with it, as a necessary incident, the power of removal. Whether the Senate must concur in the removal is aside from the point we now are considering. That point is that by the specific constitutional provision for appointment of executive officers with its necessary incident of removal, the power of appointment and removal is clearly provided for by \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 127]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution, and the legislative power of Congress in respect to both is excluded save by the specific exception as to inferior offices in the clause that follows. This is 'but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.' These words, it has been held by this court, give to Congress the power to limit and regulate removal of such inferior officers by heads of departments when it exercises its constitutional power to lodge the power of appointment with them. United States v. Perkins, \n116 \nU.S. 483, 485\n, 6 S. Ct. 449, 450 (29 L. Ed. 700). Here then is an express provision introduced in words of exception for the exercise by Congress of legislative power in the matter of appointments and removals in the case of inferior executive officers. The phrase, 'But Congress may by law vest,' is equivalent to 'excepting that Congress may by law vest.' By the plainest implication it excludes congressional dealing with appointments or removals of executive officers not falling within the exception and leaves unaffected the executive power of the President to appoint and remove them.\n A reference of the whole power of removal to general legislation by Congress is quite out of keeping with the plan of government devised by the framers of the Constitution. It could never have been intended to leave to Congress unlimited discretion to vary fundamentally the operation of the great independent executive branch of government and thus most seriously to weaken it. It would be a delegation by the convention to Congress of the function of defining the primary boundaries of another of the three great divisions of government. The inclusion of removals of executive officers in the executive power vested in the President by article 2 according to its usual definition, and the implication of his power of removal of such officers from the provision of section 2 expressly recognizing in him the power of their appoint- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 128]\n\u00a0\n ment, are a much more natural and appropriate source of the removing power.\n It is reasonable to suppose also that had it been intended to give to Congress power to regulate or control removals in the manner suggested, it would have been included among the specifically enumerated legislative powers in article 1, or in the specified limitations on the executive power in article 2. The difference between the grant of legislative power under article 1 to Congress which is limited to powers therein enumerated, and the more general grant of the executive power to the President under article 2 is significant. The fact that the executive power is given in general terms strengthened by specific terms where emphasis is appropriate, and limited by direct expressions where limitation is needed, and that no express limit is placed on the power of removal by the executive is a convincing indication that none was intended.\n It is argued that the denial of the legislative power to regulate removals in some way involves the denial of power to prescribe qualifications for office, or reasonable classification for promotion, and yet that has been often exercised. We see no conflict between the latter power and that of appointment and removal, provided of course that the qualifications do not so limit selection and so trench upon executive choice as to be in effect legislative designation. As Mr. Madison said in the First Congress:\n'The powers relative to offices are partly legislative and partly executive. The Legislature creates the office, defines the powers, limits its duration, and annexes a compensation. This done, the legislative power ceases. They ought to have nothing to do with designating the man to fill the office. That I conceive to be of an executive nature. Although it be qualified in the Constitution, I would not extend or strain that qualification beyond the limits precisely fixed for it. We ought always to con- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 129]\n\u00a0\n sider the Constitution with an eye to the principles upon which it was founded. In this point of view, we shall readily conclude that if the Legislature determines the powers, the honors, and emoluments of an office, we should be insecure if they were to designate the officer also. The nature of things restrains and confines the legislative and executive authorities in this respect; and hence it is that the Constitution stipulates for the independence of each branch of the government.' 1 Annals of Congress, 581, 582.\n\n The legislative power here referred to by Mr. Madison is the legislative power of Congress under the Constitution, not legislative power independently of it. Article 2 expressly and by implication withholds from Congress power to determine who shall appoint and who shall remove except as to inferior offices. To Congress under its legislative power is given the establishment of offices, the determination of their functions and jurisdiction, the prescribing of reasonable and relevant qualifications and rules of eligibility of appointees, and the fixing of the term for which they are to be appointed and their compensation-all except as otherwise provided by the Constitution.\n An argument in favor of full congressional power to make or withhold provision for removals of all appointed by the President is sought to be found in an asserted analogy between such a power in Congress and its power in the establishment of inferior federal courts. By article 3 the judicial power of the United States is vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time establish. By section 8 of article 1 also Congress is given power to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court. By the second section of article 3 the judicial power is extended to all cases in law and equity under this Constitution and to a substantial number of other classes of cases. Under the ac- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 130]\n\u00a0\n cepted construction the cases mentioned in this section are treated as a description and reservoir of the judicial power of the United States and a boundary of that federal power as between the United States and the states, and the field of jurisdiction within the limits of which Congress may vest particular jurisdiction in any one inferior federal court which it may constitute. It is clear that the mere establishment of a federal inferior court does not vest that court with all the judicial power of the United States as conferred in the second section of article 3, but only that conferred by Congress specifically on the particular court. It must be limited territorially and in the classes of cases to be heard, and the mere creation of the courts does not confer jurisdiction except as it is conferred in the law of its creation or its amendments. It is said that similarly in the case of the executive power, which is 'vested in the President,' the power of appointment and removal cannot arise until Congress creates the office and its duties and powers, and must accordingly be exercised and limited only as Congress shall in the creation of the office prescribe.\n We think there is little or no analogy between the two legislative functions of Congress in the cases suggested. The judicial power described in the second section of article 3 is vested in the courts collectively, but is manifestly to be distributed to different courts and conferred or withheld as Congress shall in its discretion provide their respective jurisdictions, and is not all to be vested in one particular court. Any other construction would be impracticable. The duty of Congress, therefore, to make provision for the vesting of the whole federal judicial power in federal courts, were it held to exist, would be one of imperfect obligation and unenforceable. On the other hand, the moment an office and its powers and duties are created, the power of appointment and removal, as limited by the Constitution, vests in the execu- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 131]\n\u00a0\n tive. The functions of distributing jurisdiction to courts and the exercise of it when distributed and vested are not at all parallel to the creation of an office, and the mere right of appointment to, and of removal from, the office which at once attaches to the executive by virtue of the Constitution.\n Fourth. Mr. Madison and his associates pointed out with great force the unreasonable character of the view that the convention intended, without express provision, to give to Congress or the Senate, in case of political or other differences, the means of thwarting the executive in the exercise of his great powers and in the bearing of his great responsibility by fastening upon him, as subordinate executive officers, men who by their inefficient service under him, by their lack of loyalty to the service, or by their different views of policy might make his taking care that the laws be faithfully executed most difficult or impossible.\n As Mr. Madison said in the debate in the First Congress:\n'Vest this power in the Senate jointly with the President, and you abolish at once that great principle of unity and responsibility in the executive department, which was intended for the security of liberty and the public good. If the President should possess alone the power of removal from office, those who are employed in the execution of the law will be in their proper situation, and the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest officers, the middle grade, and the highest will depend, as they ought, on the President, and the President on the community.' 1 Annals of Congress, 499.\n\n Mr. Boudinot of New Jersey said upon the same point:\n'The supreme executive officer against his assistant; and the Senate are to sit as judges to determine whether sufficient cause of removal exists. Does not this set the Senate over the head of the President? But suppose they \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 132]\n\u00a0\n shall decide in favor of the officer, what a situation is the President then in, surrounded by officers with whom, by his situation, he is compelled to act, but in whom he can have no confidence, reversing the privilege given him by the Constitution, to prevent his having officers imposed upon him who do not meet his approbation?' 1 Annals of Congress, 468.\n\n Mr. Sedgwick of Massachusetts asked the question:\n'Shall a man under these circumstances be saddled upon the President, who has been appointed for no other purpose but to aid the President in performing certain duties? Shall he be continued, I ask again, against the will of the President? If he is, where is the responsibility? Are you to look for it in the President, who has no control over the officer, no power to remove him if he acts unfeelingly or unfaithfully? Without you make him responsible, you weaken and destroy the strength and beauty of your system.' 1 Annals of Congress, 522.\n\n Made responsible under the Constitution for the effective enforcement of the law, the President needs as an indispensable aid to meet it the disciplinary influence upon those who act under him of a reserve power of removal. But it is contended that executive officers appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate are bound by the statutory law, and are not his servants to do his will, and that his obligation to care for the faithful execution of the laws does not authorize him to treat them as such. The degree of guidance in the discharge of their duties that the President may exercise over executive officers varies with the character of their service as prescribed in the law under which they act. The highest and most important duties which his subordinates perform are those in which they act for him. In such cases they are exercising not their own but his discretion. This field is a very large one. It is sometimes described as political. Kendall v. United States, 12 \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 133]\n\u00a0\n Pet 524, at page 610. Each head of a department is and must be the President's alter ego in the matters of that department where the President is required by law to exercise authority.\n The extent of the political responsibility thrust upon the President is brought out by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court in Cunningham v. Neagle, \n135 U.S. 1\n, at page 63, 10 S. Ct. 658, 668 (34 L. Ed. 55):\n'The Constitution, section 3, article 2, declares that the President 'shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,' and he is provided with the means of fulfilling this obligation by his authority to commission all the officers of the United States, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to appoint the most important of them and to fill vacancies. He is declared to be commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. The duties with are thus imposed upon him he is further enabled to perform by the recognition in the Constitution, and the creation by Acts of Congress, of executive departments, which have varied in number from four or five to seven or eight, the heads of which are familiarly called Cabinet ministers. These aid him in the performance of the great duties of his office, and represent him in a thousand acts to which it can hardly be supposed his personal attention is called, and thus he is enabled to fulfill the duty of his great department, expressed in the phrase that 'he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\n\n He instances executive dealings with foreign governments, as in the case of Martin Koszta, and he might have added the Jonathan Robins Case as argued by John Marshall in Congress, 5 Wheat. Appendix 1, and approved by this court in Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 714\n, 13 S. Ct. 1016. He notes the President's duty as to the protection of the mails, as to which the case of In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 582\n, 584 S., 15 S. Ct. 900, affords an illustration. He \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 134]\n\u00a0\n instances executive obligation in protection of the public domain, as in United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., \n125 \nU.S. 273\n, 8 S. Ct. 850, and United States v. Hughes, 11 How. 552. The possible extent of the field of the President's political executive power may be judged by the fact that the quasi civil governments of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, in the silence of Congress, had to be carried on for several years solely under his direction as commander-in-chief.\n In all such cases, the discretion to be exercised is that of the President in determining the national public interest and in directing the action to be taken by his executive subordinates to protect it. In this field his cabinet officers must do his will. He must place in each member of his official family, and his chief executive subordinates, implicit faith. The moment that he loses confidence in the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the power to remove him without delay. To require him to file charges and submit them to the consideration of the Senate might make impossible that unity and co- ordination in executive administration essential to effective action.\n The duties of the heads of departments and bureaus in which the discretion of the President is exercised and which we have described are the most important in the whole field of executive action of the government. There is nothing in the Constitution which permits a distinction between the removal of the head of a department or a bureau, when he discharges a political duty of the President or exercises his discretion, and the removal of executive officers engaged in the discharge of their other normal duties. The imperative reasons requiring an unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates in their most important duties must therefore control the interpretation of the Constitution as to all appointed by him. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 135]\n\u00a0\n But this is not to say that there are not strong reasons why the President should have a like power to remove his appointees charged with other duties than those above described. The ordinary duties of officers prescribed by statute come under the general administrative control of the President by virtue of the general grant to him of the executive power, and he may properly supervise and guide their construction of the statutes under which they act in order to secure that unitary and uniform execution of the laws which article 2 of the Constitution evidently contemplated in vesting general executive power in the President alone. Laws are often passed with specific provision for adoption of regulations by a department or bureau head to make the law workable and effective. The ability and judgment manifested by the official thus empowered, as well as his energy and stimulation of his subordinates, are subjects which the President must consider and supervise in his administrative control. Finding such officers to be negligent and inefficient, the President should have the power to remove them. Of course there may be duties so peculiarly and specifically committed to the discretion of a particular officer as to raise a question whether the President may overrule or revise the officer's interpretation of his statutory duty in a particular instance. Then there may be duties of a quasi judicial character imposed on executive officers and members of executive tribunals whose decisions after hearing affect interests of individuals, the discharge of which the President cannot in a particular case properly influence or control. But even in such a case he may consider the decision after its rendition as a reason for removing the officer, on the ground that the discretion regularly entrusted to that officer by statute has not been on the whole intelligently or wisely exercised. Otherwise he does not discharge his own constitutional duty of seeing that the laws be faithfully executed. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 136]\n\u00a0\n We have devoted much space to this discussion and decision of the question of the presidential power of removal in the First Congress, not because a congressional conclusion on a constitutional issue is conclusive, but first because of our agreement with the reasons upon which it was avowedly based, second because this was the decision of the First Congress on a question of primary importance in the organization of the government made within two years after the Constitutional Convention and within a much shorter time after its ratification, and third because that Congress numbered among its leaders those who had been members of the convention. it must necessarily constitute a precedent upon which many future laws supplying the machinery of the new government would be based and, if erroneous, would be likely to evoke dissent and departure in future Congresses. It would come at once before the executive branch of the government for compliance and might well be brought before the judicial branch for a test of its validity. As we shall see, it was soon accepted as a final decision of the question by all branches of the government.\n It was, of course, to be expected that the decision would be received by lawyers and jurists with something of the same division of opinion as that manifested in Congress, and doubts were often expressed as to its correctness. But the acquiescence which was promptly accorded it after a few years was universally recognized.\n A typical case of such acquiescence was that of Alexander Hamilton. In this discussion in the House of Representatives in 1789, Mr. White and others cited the opinion of Mr. Hamilton in respect to the necessity for the consent of the Senate to the removals by the that of Alexander Hamilton. In the discussion Annals, First Congress, 456. It was expressed in No. 77 of the Federalist, as follows:\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 137]\n\u00a0\n 'It has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the Senate in the business of appointments, that it would contribute to the stability of the administration. The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint. A change of the Chief Magistrate, therefore, would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected if he were the sole disposer of offices.'\n Hamilton changed his view of this matter during his incumbency as Secretary of the Treasury in Washington's Cabinet, as is shown by his view of Washington's first proclamation of neutrality in the war between France and Great Britain. That proclamation was at first criticized as an abuse of executive authority. It has now come to be regarded as one of the greatest and most valuable acts of the first President's administration, and has been often followed by succeeding Presidents. Hamilton's argument was that the Constitution, by vesting the executive power in the President, gave him the right, as the organ of intercourse between the nation and foreign nations, to interpret national treaties and to declare neutrality. He deduced this from article 2 of the Constitution on the executive power, and followed exactly the reasoning of Madison and his associates as to the executive power upon which the legislative decision of the first Congress as to Presidential removals depends, and he cites it as authority. He said:\n'The second article of the Constitution of the United States, section first, establishes this general proposition, that 'the Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.'\n\n'The same article, in a succeeding section, proceeds to delineate particular cases of executive power. It declares, among other things, that the President shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 138]\n\u00a0\n States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States; that he shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties; that it shall be his duty to receive ambassadors and other public ministers, and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n\n'It would not consist with the rules of sound construction, to consider this enumeration of particular authorities as derogating from the more comprehensive grant in the general clause, further than as it may be coupled with express restrictions or limitations, as in regard to the co-operation of the Senate in the appointment of officers and the making of treaties, which are plainly qualifications of the general executive powers of appointing officers and making treaties. The difficulty of a complete enumeration of all the cases of executive authority would naturally dictate the use of general terms, and would render it improbable that a specification of certain particulars was designed as a substitute for those terms, when antecedently used. The different mode of expression employed in the Constitution, in regard to the two powers, the legislative and the executive, serves to confirm this inference. In the article which gives the legislative powers of the government, the expressions are 'All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States.' In that which grants the executive power, the expiressions are 'The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.'\n\n'The enumeration ought therefore to be considered, as intended merely to specify the principal articles implied in the definition of executive power; leaving the rest to flow from the general grant of that power, interpreted in conformity with other parts of the Constitution, and with the principles of free government.\n\n'The general doctrine of our Constitution then is that the executive power of the nation is vested in the Presi- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 139]\n\u00a0\n dent, subject only to the exceptions and qualifications, which are expressed in the instrument.\n\n'Two of these have already been noticed, the participation of the Senate in the appointment of officers, and in the making of treaties. A third remains to be mentioned; the right of the Legislature to 'declare war, and grant letters of marque and reprisal.'\n\n'With these exceptions, the executive power of the United States is completely lodged in the President. This mode of construing the Constitution has indeed been recognized by Congress in formal acts upon full consideration and debate, of which the power of removal from office is an important instance. It will follow that if a proclamation of neutrality is merely an executive act, as it is believed, has been shown, the step which has been taken by the President is liable to no just exception on the score of authority.' 7 J. C. Hamilton's Works of Hamilton, 80, 81.\n\n The words of a second great constitutional authority quoted as in conflict with the congressional decision are those of Chief Justice Marshall. They were used by him in his opinion in Marbury v. Madison (1803) 1 Cranch, 137. The judgment in that case is one of the great landmarks in the history of the construction of the Constitution of the United States, and is of supreme authority first in respect to the power and duty of the Supreme Court and other courts to consider and pass upon the validity of acts of Congress enacted in violation of the limitations of the Constitution when properly brought before them in cases in which the rights of the litigating parties require such consideration and decision, and second in respect to the lack of power of Congress to vest in the Supreme Court original jurisdiction to grant the remedy of mandamus in cases in which by the Constitution it is given only appellate jurisdiction. But it is not to be regarded as such authority in respect of the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 140]\n\u00a0\n power of the President to remove officials appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate, for that question was not before the court.\n The case was heard upon a rule served upon James Madison, Secretary of State, to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue directing the defendant, Madison, to deliver to William Marbury his commission as a justice of the peace for the county of Washington in the District of Columbia. The rule was discharged by the Supreme Court, for the reason that the court had no jurisdiction in such a case to issue a writ of mandamus.\n The court had therefore nothing before it calling for a judgment upon the merits of the question of issuing the mandamus. Notwithstanding this, the opinion considered preliminarily, first, whether the relator had the right to the delivery of the commission; and, second, whether it was the duty of the Secretary of State to deliver it to him and a duty which could be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction at common law by a writ of mandamus. The facts disclosed by affidavits filed were that President Adams had nominated Marbury to be a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia under a law of Congress providing for such appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for the term of five years, and that the Senate had consented to such an appointment, that the President had signed the commission as provided by the Constitution, and had transmitted it to the Secretary of State, who, as provided by statute, had impressed the seal of the United States thereon. The opinion of the Chief Justice on these questions was that the commission was only evidence of the appointment, that upon delivery of the signed commission by the President to the Secretary of State, the office was filled and the occupant was thereafter entitled to the evidence of his appointment in the form of the commission, that the duty of the Secretary in delivering the commission to the officer entitled \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 141]\n\u00a0\n was merely ministerial and could be enforced by mandamus, that the function of the Secretary in this regard was entirely to be distinguished from his duty as a subordinate to the President in the discharge of the President's political duties which could not be controlled.\n It would seem that this conclusion applied, under the reasoning of the opinion, whether the officer was removable by the President or not, if in fact the President had not removed him. But the opinion assumed that in the case of a removable office the writ would fail on the presumption that there was in such a case discretion of the appointing power to withhold the commission. And so the Chief Justice proceeded to express an opinion on the question whether the appointee was removable by the President. He said:\n'As the law creating the office gave the officer a right to hold it for five years, independent of the executive, the appointment was not revocable; but vested in the officer legal rights, which are protected by the laws of his country.'\n\n There was no answer by Madison to the rule issued in the case. The case went by default. It did not appear even by avowed opposition to the issue of the writ that the President had intervened in the matter at all. It would seem to have been quite consistent with the case as shown that this was merely an arbitrary refusal by the Secretary to perform his ministerial function, and therefore that the expression of opinion that the officer was not removable by the President was unnecessary, even to the conclusion that a writ in a proper case could issue. However this may be, the whole statement was certainly obiter dictum with reference to the judgment actually reached. The question whether the officer was removable was not argued to the court by any counsel contending for that view. Counsel for the relator, who made the only argument, contended that the officer was not removable by the President, because he held a judicial office and \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 142]\n\u00a0\n under the Constitution could not be deprived of his office for the five years of his term by presidential action. The opinion contains no wider discussion of the question than that quoted above.\n While everything that the great Chief Justice said, whether obiter dictum or not, challenges the highest and most respectful consideration, it is clear that the mere statement of the conclusion made by him, without any examination of the discussion which went on in the First Congress, and without reference to the elaborate arguments there advanced to maintain the decision of 1789, cannot be regarded as authority in considering the weight to be attached to that decision, a decision which, as we shall see, he subsequently recognized as a well-established rule of constitutional construction.\n In such a case we may well recur to the Chief Justice's own language in Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, in which, in declining to yield to the force of his previous language in Marbury v. Madison, which was unnecessary to the judgment in that case and was obiter dictum, said:\n'It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they to beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.'\n\n The weight of this dictum of the Chief Justice as to a presidential removal in Marbury v. Madison, was considered by this Court in Parsons v. United States, 167 \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 143]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 324, 17 S. Ct. 880. It was a suit by Parsons against the United States for the payment of the balance due for his salary and fees as United States district attorney for Alabama. He had been commissioned as such under the statute for the term of four years from the date of the commission, subject to the conditions prescribed by law. There was no express power of removal provided. Before the end of the four years he was removed by the President. He was denied recovery.\n The language of the court in Marbury v. Madison, already referred to, was pressed upon this court to show that Parsons was entitled, against the presidential action of removal, to continue in office. If it was authoritative, and stated the law as to an executive office, it ended the case; but this court did not recognize it as such, for the reason that the Chief Justice's language relied on was not germane to the point decided in Marbury v. Madison. If his language was more than a dictum and a decision, then the Parsons' Case overrules it.\n Another distinction suggested by Mr. Justice Peckham in Parsons' Case was that the remarks of the Chief Justice were in reference to an office in the District of Columbia, over which by article 1,  8, subd. 17, Congress had exclusive jurisdiction in all cases, and might not apply to offices outside of the District in respect to which the constant practice and the congressional decision had been the other way (page 335 (17 S. Ct. 880)). How much weight should be given to this distinction, which might accord to the special exclusive jurisdiction conferred on Congress over the District power to ignore the usual constitutional separation between the executive and legislative branches of the government, we need not consider.\n If the Chief Justice in Marbury v. Madison intended to express an opinion for the court inconsistent with the legislative decision of 1789, it is enough to observe that he changed his mind, for otherwise it is inconceivable that \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 144]\n\u00a0\n he should have written and printed his full account of the discussion and decision in the First Congress and his acquiescence in it, to be found in his Life of Washington (volume V, pp. 192-200).\n He concluded his account as follows:\n'After an ardent discussion which consumed several days, the committee divided; and the amendment (i. e., to strike out from the original bill the words 'to be removable by the President') was negatived by a majority of 34 to 20. The opinion thus expressed by the House of Representatives did not explicitly convey their sense of the Constitution. Indeed the express grant of the power of the President, rather implied a right in the Legislature to give or withhold it at their discretion. To obviate any misunderstanding of the principle on which the question had been decided, Mr. Benson ( later) moved in the House, when the report of the committee of the whole was taken up, to amend the second clause in the bill so as clearly to imply the power of removal to be solely in the President. He gave notice that if he should succeed in this, he would move to strike out the words which had been the subject of debate. If those words continued, he said the power of removal by the President might hereafter appear to be exercised by virtue of a legislative grant only and consequently be subjected to legislative instability, when he was well satisfied in his own mind, that it was by fair construction, fixed in the Constitution. The motion was seconded by Mr. Madison, and both amendments were adopted. As the bill passed into a law, it has ever been considered as a full expression of the sense of the Legislature on this important part of the American Constitution.'\n\n This language was first published in 1807, four years after the judgment in Marbury v. Madison, and the edition was revised by the Chief Justice in 1832. 3 Beveridge, Life of Marshall, 248, 252, 272, 273. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 145]\n\u00a0\n Congress in a number of acts followed and enforced the legislative decision of 1789 for 74 years. In the act of the First Congress, which adapted to the Constitution the ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which had provided for the appointment and removal of executive territorial officers by the Congress under the Articles of Confederation, it was said:\n'In all cases where the United States in Congress assembled, might, by the said ordinance, revoke any commission or remove from any office, the President is hereby declared to have the same powers of revocation and removal.' 1 Stat. 53, c. 8.\n\n This was approved 11 days after the act establishing the Department of Foreign Affairs and was evidently in form a declaration in accord with the legislative constitutional construction of the latter act. In the provision for the Treasury and War Departments, the same formula was used as occurred in the act creating the Department of Foreign Affairs, but it was omitted from other creative acts only because the decision was thought to be settled constitutional construction. In re Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259.\n Occasionally we find that Congress thought it wiser to make express what would have been understood. Thus in the Judiciary Act of 1789 we find it provided in section 27 (1 Stat. 87, c. 20):\n'That a marshal shall be appointed in and for each district for the term of four years, but shall be removable ... at pleasure, whose duty it shall be to attend the District and Circuit Courts.'\n\n That act became a law on September 24th. It was formulated by a Senate committee of which Oliver Ellsworth was chairman and which presumably was engaged in drafting it during the time of the congressional debate on removals.\n Section 35 of the same act provided for the appointment of an attorney for the United States to prosecute crimes and conduct civil actions on behalf of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 146]\n\u00a0\n the United States, but nothing was said as to his term of office or of his removal. The difference in the two cases was evidently to avoid any inference from the fixing of the term that a conflict with the legislative decision of 1789 was intended.\n In the Act of May 15, 1820, 3 Stat. 582, c. 102, Congress provided that thereafter all district attorneys, collectors of customs, naval officers and surveyors of the customs, navy agents, receivers of public moneys for land, registers of the land office, paymasters in the army, the apothecary general, the assistant apothecaries general, and the commissary general of purchases, to be appointed under the laws of the United States shall be appointed for the term of four years, but shall be removable from office at pleasure.\n It is argued that these express provisions for removal at pleasure indicate that without them no such power would exist in the President. We cannot accede to this view. Indeed the conclusion that they were adopted to show conformity to the legislative decision of 1789 is authoritatively settled by a specific decision of this court.\n In the Parsons' Case, \n167 \nU.S. 324\n, 17 S. Ct. 880, already referred to, the exact question which the court had to decide was whether, under section 769 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1295), providing that district attorneys should be appointed for a term of four years and their commissions should cease and expire at the expiration of four years from their respective dates, the appellant, having been removed by the President from his office as district attorney before the end of his term, could recover his salary for the remainder of the term. If the President had no power of removal, then he could recover. The court held that under that section the President did have the power of removal because of the derivation of the section from the act of 1820, above quoted. In section 769 the specific provision of the act of 1820 that the officers should be removable \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 147]\n\u00a0\n from office at pleasure was omitted. This court held that the section should be construed as having been passed in the light of the acquiescence of Congress in the decision of 1789, and therefore included the power of removal by the President, even though the clause for removal was omitted. This reasoning was essential to the conclusion reached and makes the construction by this court of the act of 1820 authoritative. The court used in respect to the act of 1820 this language (\n167 \nU.S. 324, 339\n, 17 S. Ct. 880, 885):\n'The provision for a removal from office at pleasure was not necessary for the exercise of that power by the President, because of the fact that he was then regarded as being clothed with such power in any event. Considering the construction of the Constitution in this regard as given by the Congress of 1789, and having in mind the constant and uniform practice of the government in harmony with such construction, we must construe this act as providing absolutely for the expiration of the term of office at the end of four years, and not as giving a term that shall last, at all events, for that time, and we think the provision that the officials were removable from office at pleasure was but a recognition of the construction thus almost universally adhered to and acquiesced in as to the power of the President to remove.'\n\n In the Act of July 17, 1862, 12 Stat. 596, c. 200, Congress actually requested the President to make removals in the following language:\n'The President of the United States be, and hereby is, authorized and requested to dismiss and discharge from the military service either in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or volunteer force, ... any officer for any cause which, in his judgment, either renders such officer unsuitable for, or whose dismission would promote, the public service.' Section 17.\n\n Attorney General Devens (15 Op. A. G. 421) said of this act that, so far as it gave authority to the President, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 148]\n\u00a0\n it was simply declaratory of the long-established law; that the force of the act was to be found in the word 'requested,' by which it was intended to re-enforce strongly this power in the hands of the President at a great crisis of the state-a comment by the Attorney General which was expressly approved by this court in Blake v. United States, \n103 U.S. 227\n, 234 (26 L. Ed. 462).\n The acquiescence in the legislative decision of 1789 for nearly three- quarters of a century by all branches of the government has been affirmed by this court in unmistakable terms. In Parsons v. United States, already cited, in which the matter of the power of removal was reviewed at length in connection with that legislative decision, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Peckham, said (page 330 (17 S. Ct. 882)):\n'Many distinguished lawyers originally had very different opinions in regard to this power from the one arrived at by this Congress, but when the question was alluded to in after years they recognized that the decision of Congress in 1789, and the universal practice of the government under it, had settled the question beyond any power of alteration.'\n\n We find this confirmed by Chancellor Kent's and Mr. Justice Story's comments. Chancellor Kent, in writing to Mr. Webster in January, 1830, concerning the decision of 1789, said:\n'I heard the question debated in the summer of 1789, and Madison, Benson, Ames, Lawrence, etc., were in favor of the right of removal by the President, and such has been the opinion ever since and the practice. I thought they were right because I then thought this side uniformly right.'\n\n Then, expressing subsequent pause and doubt upon this construction as an original question because of Hamilton's original opinion in The Federalist, already referred to, he continued:\n'On the other hand, it is too late to call the President's power in question after a declaratory act of Congress and \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 149]\n\u00a0\n an acquiescence of half a century. We should hurt the reputation of our government with the world, and we are accused already of the Republican tendency of reducing all executive power into the legislative, and making Congress a national convention. That the President grossly abuses the power of removal is manifest, but it is the evil genius of Democracy to be the sport of factions.' 1 Private Correspondence of Daniel Webster (Fletcher Webster Ed.) 486 (1903 National Ed., Little Brown Co.)\n\n In his Commentaries, referring to this question, the Chancellor said:\n'This question has never been made the subject of judicial discussion; and the construction given to the Constitution in 1789 has continued to rest on this loose, incidental, declaratory opinion of Congress, and the sense and practice of government since that time. It may now be considered as firmly and definitely settled, and there is good sense and practical utility in the construction.' 1 Kent, Commentaries, lecture 14, p. 310, subject, 'Marshals.'\n\n Mr. Justice Story, after a very full discussion of the decision of 1789, in which he intimates that as an original question he would favor the view of the minority, says:\n'That the final decision of this question so made was greatly influenced by the exalted character of the President then in office was asserted at the time, and has always been believed. Yet the doctrine was opposed, as well as supported, by the highest talents and patriotism of the country. The public, however, acquiesced in this decision, and it constitutes, perhaps, the most extraordinary case in the history of the government of a power, conferred by implication on the executive by the assent of a bare majority of Congress, which has not been questioned on many other occasions. Even the most jealous advocates of state rights seem to have slumbered over this vast reach of authority, and have left it untouched, as the neutral ground of controversy, in which they de- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 150]\n\u00a0\n sired to reap no harvest, and from which they retired, without leaving any protestations of title or contest. Nor is this general acquiescence and silence without a satisfactory explanation.' 2 Story, Constitution,  1543.\n\n He finds that until a then very recent period, namely, the administration of President Jackson, the power of unrestricted removal had been exercised by all the Presidents, but that moderation and forbearance had been shown; that under President Jackson, however, an opposite course had been pursued extensively and brought again the executive power of removal to a severe scrutiny. The learned author then says:\n'If there has been any aberration from the true constitutional exposition of the power of removal (which the reader must decide for himself), it will be difficult, and perhaps impracticable, after 40 years' experience, to recall the practice to correct theory. But, at all events, it will be a consolation to those who love the Union, and honor a devotion to the patriotic discharge of duty, that in regard to 'inferior officers' (which appellation probably includes ninety- nine out of a hundred of the lucrative offices in the government), the remedy for any permanent abuse is still within the power of Congress, by the simple expedient of requiring the consent of the Senate to removals in such cases.' 2 Story, Constitution,  1544.\n\n In an article by Mr. Fish contained in American Historical Association Reports, for 1899 (page 67), removals from office, not including presidential removals in the Army and the Navy, in the administrations from Washington to Johnson are stated to have been as follows: Washington, 17; Adams, 19; Jefferson, 62; Madison, 24; Jackson, 180; Van Buren, 43; Harrison and Tyler, 389; Polk, 228; Taylor, 491; Fillmore, 73; Pierce, 771; Buchanan, 253; Lincoln, 1,400; Johnson, 726. These, we may infer, were all made in conformity to the legislative decision of 1789.\n Mr. Webster is cited as opposed to the decision of the First Congress. His views were evoked by the contro- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 151]\n\u00a0\n versy between the Senate and President Jackson. The alleged general use of patronage for political purposes by the President and his dismissal of Duane, Secretary of the Treasury, without reference to the Senate, upon Duane's refusal to remove government deposits from the United States Bank, awakened bitter criticism in the Senate, and led to an extended discussion of the power of removal by the President. In a speech, May 7, 1834, on the President's protest, Mr. Webster asserted that the power of removal, without the consent of the Senate, was in the President alone, according to the established construction of the Constitution, and that Duane's dismissal could not be justly said to be a usurpation. 4 Webster, Works, 103-105. A year later, in February, 1835, Mr. Webster seems to have changed his views somewhat, and in support of a bill requiring the President in making his removals from office to send to the Senate his reasons therefor made an extended argument against the correctness of the decision of 1789. He closed his speech thus:\n'But I think the decision of 1789 has been established by practice, and recognized by subsequent laws, as the settled construction of the Constitution, and that it is our duty to act upon the case accordingly for the present, without admitting that Congress may not, hereafter, if necessity shall require it, reverse the decision of 1789.' 4 Webster, 179, 198.\n\n Mr. Webster denied that the vesting of the executive power in the President was a grant of power. It amounted, he said, to no more than merely naming the department. Such a construction, although having the support of as great an expounder of the Constitution as Mr. Webster, is not in accord with the usual canon of interpretation of that instrument, which requires that real effect should be given to all the words it uses. Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537, 544\n, 23 S. Ct. 398; Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 534\n, 4 S. Ct. 111; Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 612; Holmes v. Jennison, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 152]\n\u00a0\n 14 Pet. 540, 570, 571, 614, 618; Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 398; Marbury v. Madison, supra, 1 Cranch, at page 174. Nor can we concur in Mr. Webster's apparent view that when Congress, after full consideration and with the acquiescence and long practice of all the branches of the government, has established the construction of the Constitution, it may by its mere subsequent legislation reverse such construction. It is not given power by itself thus to amend the Constitution. It is not unjust to note that Mr. Webster's final conclusion on this head was after pronounced political controversy with General Jackson, which he concedes may have affected his judgment and attitude on the subject.\n Mr. Clay and Mr. Calhoun, acting upon a like impulse, also vigorously attacked the decision, but no legislation of any kind was adopted in that period to reverse the established constitutional construction, while its correctness was vigorously asserted and acted on by the executive. On February 10, 1835, President Jackson declined to comply with the Senate resolution, regarding the charges which caused the removal of officials from office, saying:\n'The President in cases of this nature possesses the exclusive power of removal from office, and, under the sanctions of his official oath and of his liability to impeachment, he is bound to exercise it whenever the public welfare shall require. If, on the other hand, from corrupt motives he abuses this power, he is exposed to the same responsibilities. On no principle known to our institutions can he be required to account for the manner in which he discharged this portion of his public duties, save only in the mode and under the forms prescribed by the Constitution.' 3 Messages of the Presidents, 1352.\n\n In Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, decided by this court in 1839, the prevailing effect of the legislative decision of 1789 was fully recognized. The question there \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 153]\n\u00a0\n was of the legality of the removal from office by a United States District Court of its clerk, appointed by it under section 7 of the Judiciary Act ( 1 Stat. 76, c. 20). The case was ably argued and the effect of the legislative decision of the First Congress was much discussed. The court said (pages 258, 259):\n'The Constitution is silent with respect to the power of removal from office, where the tenure is not fixed. It provides that the judges, both of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior. But no tenure is fixed for the office of clerks . ... It cannot, for a moment, be admitted that it was the intention of the Constitution that those offices which are denominated inferior offices should be held during life. And if removable at pleasure, by whom is such removal to be made? In the absence of all constitutional provision or statutory regulation, it would seem to be a sound and necessary rule to consider the power of removal as incident to the power of appointment. This power of removal from office was a subject much disputed, and upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained in the early history of this government. This related, however, to the power of the President to remove officers appointed with the concurrence of the Senate, and the great question was whether the removal was to be by the President alone, or with the concurrence of the Senate, both constituting the appointing power. No one denied the power of the President and Senate, jointly, to remove, where the tenure of the office was not fixed by the Constitution, which was a full recognition of the principle that the power of removal was incident to the power of appointment. But it was very early adopted as the practical construction of the Constitution that this power was vested in the President alone. And such would appear to have been the legislative construction of the Constitution. For in the organization of the three great \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 154]\n\u00a0\n Departments of State, War and Treasury, in the year 1789, provision is made for the appointment of a subordinate officer, by the head of the department, who should have the charge and custody of the records, books, and papers appertaining to the office, when the head of the department should be removed from the office by the President of the United States. 1 Story, 5, 31, 47. When the Navy Department was established in the year 1798 (1 Story, 498), ... provision is made for the charge and custody of the books, records and documents of the department, in case of vacancy in the office of secretary, by removal or otherwise. It is not here said, by removal by the President, as is done with respect to the heads of the other departments; and yet there can be no doubt that he holds his office by the same tenure as the other secretaries, and is removable by the President. The change of phraseology arose, probably, from its having become the settled and well-understood construction of the Constitution that the power of removal was vested in the President alone, in such cases, although the appointment of the officer was by the President and Senate.'\n\n The legislative decision of 1789 and this court's recognition of it was followed in 1842 by Attorney General Legare in the administration of President Tyler (4 Op. A. G. 1), in 1847 by Attorney General Clifford in the administration of President Polk (4 Op. A. G. 603), by Attorney General Crittenden in the administration of President Fillmore (5 Op. A. G. 288, 290), and by Attorney General Cushing in the Administration of President Buchanan (6 Op. A. G. 4), all of whom delivered opinions of a similar tenor.\n It has been sought to make an argument refuting our conclusion as to the President's power of removal of executive officers by reference to the statutes passed and practice prevailing from 1789 until recent years in respect to the removal of judges, whose tenure is not fixed by \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 155]\n\u00a0\n article 3 of the Constitution, and who are not strictly United States judges under that article. The argument is that, as there is no express constitutional restriction as to the removal of such judges, they come within the same class as executive officers, and that statutes and practice in respect to them may properly be used to refute the authority of the legislative decision of 1789 and acquiescence therein.\n The fact seems to be that judicial removals were not considered in the discussion in the First Congress, and that the First Congress, August 7, 1789 (1 Stat. 50-53, c. 8), and succeeding Congresses until 1804, assimilated the judges appointed for the territories to those appointed under article 3, and provided life tenure for them, while other officers of those territories were appointed for a term of years unless sooner removed. See, as to such legislation, dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice McLean, United States v. Guthrie, 17 How, 284, 308. In American Insurance Company v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511 (1828), it was held that the territorial judges were not judges of constitutional courts, on which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution on the general government could be deposited. After some 10 or 15 years, the judges in some territories were appointed for a term of years, and the Governor and other officers were appointed for a term of years unless sooner removed. In Missouri and Arkansas only were the judges appointed for 4 years if not sooner removed.\n After 1804 removals were made by the President of territorial judges appointed for terms of years before the ends of their terms. They were sometimes suspended and sometimes removed. Between 1804 and 1867 there were 10 removals of such judges in Minnesota, Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Nebraska. The Executive Department seemed then to consider that territorial judges were subject to removal just as if they had been executive \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 156]\n\u00a0\n officers under the legislative decision of 1789. Such was the opinion of Attorney General Crittenden in the question of the removal of the Chief Justice of Minnesota Territory (5 Op. A. G. 288) in 1851. Since 1867, territorial judges have been removed by the President, seven in Arizona, one in Hawaii, one in Indian Territory, two in Idaho, three in New Mexico, two in Utah, one in Wyoming.\n The question of the President's power to remove such a judge as viewed by Mr. Crittenden came before this court in United States v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284. The relator, Goodrich, who had been removed by the President from his office as a territorial judge, sought by mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Treasury to draw his warrant for the relator's salary for the remainder of his term after removal, and contested the Attorney General's opinion that the President's removal in such a case was valid. This court did not decide this issue, but held that it had no power to issue a writ of mandamus in such a case. Mr. Justice McLean delivered a dissenting opinion (at page 308). He differed from the court in its holding that mandamus would not issue. He expressed a doubt as to the correctness of the legislative decision of the First Congress as to the power of removal by the President alone of executive officers appointed by him with the consent of the Senate, but admitted that the decision as to them had been so acquiesced in, and the practice had so conformed to it, that it could not be set aside. But he insisted that the statutes and practice which had governed the appointment and removal of territorial judges did not come within the scope and effect of the legislative decision of 1789. He pointed out that the argument upon which the decision rested was based on the necessity for presidential removals in the discharge by the President of his executive duties and his taking care that the laws be faithfully executed, and that such an argument could not \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 157]\n\u00a0\n apply to the judges, over whose judicial duties he could not properly exercise any supervision or control after their appointment and confirmation.\n In the case of McAllister v. United States, \n141 \nU.S. 174\n, 11 S. Ct. 949, a judge of the District Court of Alaska it was held could be deprived of a right to salary as such by his suspension under Revised Statutes  1768. That section gave the President in his discretion authority to suspend any civil officer appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, except judges of the courts of the United States, until the end of the next session of the Senate, and to designate some suitable person, subject to be removed in his discretion by the designation of another, to perform the duties of such suspended officer. It was held that the words 'except judges of the courts of the United States' applied to judges appointed under article 3 and did not apply to territorial judges, and that the President under section 1768 had power to suspend a territorial judge during a recess of the Senate, and no recovery could be had for salary during that suspended period. Mr. Justice Field with Justices Gray and Brown dissented on the ground that in England by the act of 13 William III it had become established law that judges should hold their offices independent of executive removal, and that our Constitution expressly makes such limitation as to the only judges specifically mentioned in it, and should be construed to carry such limitation as to other judges appointed under its provisions.\n Referring in Parsons v. United States, \n167 U.S. 324\n, at page 337, 17 S. Ct. 880, 885 (42 L. Ed. 185), to the McAllister Case, this court said:\n'The case contains nothing in opposition to the contention as to the practical construction that had been given to the Constitution by Congress in 1789, and by the government generally since that time and up to the act of 1867.'\n\n The questions, first, whether a judge appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate under an act of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 158]\n\u00a0\n Congress, not under authority of article 3 of the Constitution, can be removed by the President alone without the consent of the Senate; second, whether the legislative decision of 1789 covers such a case; and, third, whether Congress may provide for his removal in some other way-present considerations different from those which apply in the removal of executive officers, and therefore we do not decide them.\n We come now to consider an argument, advanced and strongly pressed on behalf of the complainant, that this case concerns only the removal of a postmaster, that a postmaster is an inferior officer, and that such an office was not included within the legislative decision of 1789, which related only to superior officers to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This, it is said, is the distinction which Chief Justice Marshall had in mind in Marbury v. Madison in the language already discussed in respect to the President's power of removal of a District of Columbia justice of the peace appointed and confirmed for a term of years. We find nothing in Marbury v. Madison to indicate any such distinction. It cannot be certainly affirmed whether the conclusion there stated was based on a dissent from the legislative decision of 1789, or on the fact that the office was created under the special power of Congress exclusively to legislate for the District of Columbia, or on the fact that the office was a judicial one, or on the circumstance that it was an inferior office. In view of the doubt as to what was really the basis of the remarks relied on and their obiter dictum character, they can certainly not be used to give weight to the argument that the 1789 decision only related to superior officers.\n The very heated discussions during General Jackson's administration, except as to the removal of Secretary Duane, related to the distribution of offices, which were most of them inferior offices, and it was the operation of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 159]\n\u00a0\n the legislative decision of 1789 upon the power of removal of incumbents of such offices that led the General to refuse to comply with the request of the Senate that he give his reasons for the removals therefrom. It was to such inferior officers that Chancellor Kent's letter to Mr. Webster already quoted was chiefly directed, and the language cited from his commentaries on the decision of 1789 was used with reference to the removal of United States marishals. It was such inferior offices that Mr. Justice Story conceded to be covered by the legislative decision in his treatise on the Constitution, already cited, when he suggested a method by which the abuse of patronage in such offices might be avoided. It was with reference to removals from such inferior offices that the already cited opinions of the Attorneys General, in which the legislative decision of 1789 was referred to as controlling authority, were delivered. That of Attorney General Legare (4 Op. A. G. 1) affected the removal of a surgeon in the Navy. The opinion of Attorney General Clifford (4 Op A. G. 603, 612) involved an officer of the same rank. The opinion of Attorney General Cushing (6 Op. A. G. 4) covered the office of military storekeeper. Finally, Parsons' Case, where it was the point in judgment, conclusively establishes for this court that the legislative decision of 1789 applied to a United States attorney, an inferior officer.\n It is further pressed on us that, even though the legislative decision of 1789 included inferior officers, yet under the legislative power given Congress with respect to such officers it might directly legislate as to the method of their removal without changing their method of appointment by the President with the consent of the Senate. We do not think the language of the Constitution justifies such a contention.\n Section 2 of article 2, after providing that the President shall nominate and with the consent of the Senate \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 160]\n\u00a0\n appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, judges of the Supreme Court and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law, contains the proviso:\n'But the Congress may be law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law or in the heads of departments.'\n\n In United States v. Perkins, \n116 \nU.S. 483\n, 6 S. Ct. 449, a cadet engineer, a graduate of the Naval Academy, brought suit to recover his salary for the period after his removal by the Secretary of the Navy. It was decided that his right was established by Revised Statutes,  1229 (Comp. St.  2001), providing that no officer in the military or naval service should in time of peace be dismissed from service, except in pursuance of a sentence of court-martial. The section was claimed to be an infringement upon the constitutional prerogative of the executive. The Id., 20 Court of Claims, 438, 444, refused to yield to this argument and said:\n'Whether or not Congress can restrict the power of removal incident to the power of appointment of those officers who are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate under the authority of the Constitution (article 2, section 2), does not arise in this case and need not be considered. We have no doubt that, when Congress by law vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads of departments it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest. The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enact in relation to the officers so appointed. The head of a department has no constitutional prerogative of appointment to offices independently of the legislation of Conggress, and by such legislation he must be governed, not only in making appointments, but in all that is incident thereto.' \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 161]\n\u00a0\n This language of the Court of Claims was approved by this court and the judgment was affirmed.\n\n The power to remove inferior executive officers, like that to remove superior executive officers, in an incident of the power to appoint them, and is in its nature an executive power. The authority of Congress given by the excepting clause to vest the appointment of such inferior officers in the heads of departments carries with it authority incidentally to invest the heads of departments with power to remove. It has been the practice of Congress to do so and this court has recognized that power. The court also has recognized in the Perkins Case that Congress, in committing the appointment of such inferior officers to the heads of departments, may prescribe incidential regulations controlling and restricting the latter in the exercise of the power of removal. But the court never has held, nor reasonably could hold, although it is argued to the contrary on behalf of the appellant, that the excepting clause enables Congress to draw to itself, or to either branch of it, the power to remove or the right to participate in the exercise of that power. To do this would be to go beyond the words and implications of that clause, and to infringe the constitutional principle of the separation of governmental powers.\n Assuming, then, the power of Congress to regulate removals as incidental to the exercise of its constitutional power to vest appointments of inferior officers in the heads of departments, certainly so long as Congress does not exercise that power, the power of removal must remain where the Constitution places it, with the President, as part of the executive power, in accordance with the legislative decision of 1789 which we have been considering.\n Whether the action of Congress in removing the necessity for the advice and consent of the Senate and putting the power of appointment in the President alone would \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 162]\n\u00a0\n make his power of removal in such case any more subject to Congressional legislation than before is a question this court did not decide in the Perkins Case. Under the reasoning upon which the legislative decision of 1789 was put, it might be difficult to avoid a negative answer, but it is not before us and we do not decide it.\n The Perkins Case is limited to the vesting by Congress of the appointment of an inferior officer in the head of a department. The condition upon which the power of Congress to provide for the removal of inferior officers rests is that it shall vest the appointment in some one other than the President with the consent of the Senate. Congress may not obtain the power and provide for the removal of such officer except on that condition. If it does not choose to intrust the appointment of such inferior officers to less authority than the President with the consent of the Senate, it has no power of providing for their removal. That is the reason why the suggestion of Mr. Justice Story, relied upon in this discussion, cannot be supported, if it is to have the construction which is contended for. He says that in regard to inferior officers under the legislative decision of 1789 'the remedy for any permanent abuse (i. e., of executive patronage) is still within the power of Congress by the simple expedient of requiring the consent of the Senate to removals in such cases.' It is true that the remedy for the evil of political executive removals of inferior offices is with Congress by a simple expedient but it includes a change of the power of appointment from the President with the consent of the Senate. Congress must determine, first, that the office is inferior; and, second, that it is willing that the office shall be filled by the appointment by some other authority than the President with the consent of the Senate. That the latter may be an important consideration is manifest, and is the subject of comment by this court in its opinion in the case of Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311, 315\n, 23 S. Ct. 535, 536 (47 L. Ed. 828), where this court said:\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 163]\n\u00a0\n 'To take away this power of removal in relation to an inferior office created by statute, although that statute provided for an appointment thereto by the President and confirmation by the Senate, would require very clear and explicit language. It should not be held to be takenaway by mere inference or implication. Congress has regarded the office as of sufficient importance to make it proper to fill it by an appointment to be made by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It has thereby classed it as appropriately coming under the direct supervision of the President and to be administered by officers appointed by him (and confirmed by the Senate), with reference to his constitutional responsibility to see that the laws are faithfully executed. Article 2,  3.'\n It is said that for 40 years or more postmasters were all by law appointed by the Postmaster General. This was because Congress under the excepting clause so provided. But thereafter Congress required certain classes of them to be, as they now are, appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. This is an indication that Congress deemed appointment by the President with the consent of the Senate essential to the public welfare, and until it is willing to vest their appointment in the head of the department they will be subject to removal by the President alone, and any legislation to the contrary must fall as in conflict with the Constitution.\n Summing up, then, the facts as to acquiescence by all branches of the government in the legislative decision of 1789 as to executive officers, whether superior or inferior, we find that from 1789 until 1863, a period of 74 years, there was no act of Congress, no executive act, and no decision of this court at variance with the declaration of the First Congress; but there was, as we have seen, clear affirmative recognition of it by each branch of the government.\n Our conclusion on the merits, sustained by the arguments before stated, is that article 2 grants to the Presi- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 164]\n\u00a0\n dent the executive power of the government-i, e., the general administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment and removal of executive officers-a conclusion confirmed by his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; that article 2 excludes the exercise of legislative power by Congress to provide for appointments and removals, except only as granted therein to Congress in the matter of inferior offices; that Congress is only given power to provide for appointments and removals of inferior officers after it has vested, and on condition that it does vest, their appointment in other authority than the President with the Senate's consent; that the provisions of the second section of article 2, which blend action by the legislative branch, or by part of it, in the work of the executive, are limitations to be strictly construed, and not to be extended by implication; that the President's power of removal is further established as an incident to his specifically enumerated function of appointment by and with the advice of the Senate, but that such incident does not by implication extend to removals the Senate's power of checking appointments; and, finally, that to hold otherwise would make it impossible for the President, in case of political or other difference with the Senate or Congress, to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n We come now to a period in the history of the government when both houses of Congress attempted to reverse this constitutional construction, and to subject the power of removing executive officers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to the control of the Senate, indeed finally to the assumed power in Congress to place the removal of such officers anywhere in the government.\n This reversal grew out of the serious political difference between the two houses of Congress and President John- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 165]\n\u00a0\n son. There was a two-thirds majority of the Republican party, in control of each house of Congress, which resented what it feared would be Mr. Johnson's obstructive course in the enforcement of the reconstruction meansures in respect to the states whose people had lately been at war against the national government. This led the two houses to enact legislation to curtail the then acknowledged powers of the President. It is true that during the latter part of Mr. Lincoln's term two important voluminous acts were passed, each containing a section which seemed inconsistent with the legislative decision of 1789 (Act Feb. 25, 1863, 12 Stat. 665, c. 58,  1; Act March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 489, c. 79,  12); but they were adopted without discussion of the inconsistency and were not tested by executive or judicial inquiry. The real challenge to the decision of 1789 was begun by the Act of July 13, 1866, 14 Stat. 92, c. 176, forbidding dismissals of Army and Navy officers in time of peace without a sentence by court-martial, which this court in Blake v. United States, \n103 U.S. 227\n, at page 235 (26 L. Ed. 462) attributed to the growing difference between President Johnson and Congress.\n Another measure having the same origin and purpose was a rider on the Army Appropriation Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 487, c. 170,  2, which fixed the headquarters of the General of the Army of the United States at Washington, directed that all orders relating to military operations by the President or Secretary of War should be issued through the General of the Army, who should not be removed, suspended, or relieved from command, or assigned to duty elsewhere, except at his own request, without the previous approval of the Senate; that any orders of instructions relating to military operations issued contrary to this should be void; and that any officer of the Army who should issue, knowingly transmit, or obey any orders issued contrary to the provisions of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 166]\n\u00a0\n this section, should be liable to imprisonment for years. By the Act of March 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 44, c. 34,  2, the next Congress repealed a statutory provision as to appeals in habeas corpus cases, with the design, as was avowed by Mr. Schenck, chairman of the House committee on ways and means, of preventing this court from passing on the validity of reconstruction legislation. 81 Congressional Globe, pp. 1881, 1883; Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506.\n But the chief legislation in support of the reconstruction policy of Congress was the Tenure of Office Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 430, c. 154, providing that all officers appointed by and with the consent of the Senate should hold their offices until their successors should have in like manner been appointed and qualified; that certain heads of departments, including the Secretary of War, should hold their offices during the term of the President by whom appointed and one month thereafter, subject to removal by consent of the Senate. The Tenure of Office Act was vetoed, but it was passed over the veto. The House of Representatives preferred articles of impeachment against President Johnson for refusal to comply with, and for conspiracy to defeat, the legislation above referred to, but he was acquitted for lack of a two- thirds vote for conviction in the Senate.\n In Parsons v. United States, supra, the court thus refers to the passage of the Tenure of Office Act (page 340):\n'The President, as is well known, vetoed the Tenure of Office Act, because he said it was unconstitutional in that it assumed to take away the power of removal constitutionally vested in the President of the United States-a power which had been uniformly exercised by the Executive Department of the government from its foundation. Upon the return of the bill to Congress it was passed over the President's veto by both houses and became a law. The continued and uninterrupted practice of the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 167]\n\u00a0\n government from 1789 was thus broken in upon and changed by the passage of this act, so that, if constitutional, thereafter all executive officers whose appointments had been made with the advice and consent of the Senate could not be removed by the President without the concurrence of the Senate in such order of removal.\n\n'Mr. Blaine, who was in Congress at the time, in afterwards speaking of this bill, said: 'It was an extreme proposition-a new departure from the long-established usage of the federal government-and for that reason, if for no other, personally degrading to the incumbent of the presidential chair. It could only have grown out of abnormal excitement created by dissensions between the two great departments of the government. ... The measure was resorted to as one of self- defense against the alleged aggressions and unrestrained power of the Executive Department.' Twenty Years of Congress, vol. 2, pp. 273, 274.'\n\n The extreme provisions of all this legislation were a full justification for the considerations, so strongly advanced by Mr. Madison and his associates in the First Congress, for insisting that the power of removal of executive officers by the President alone was essential in the division of powers between the executive and the legislative bodies. It exhibited in a clear degree the paralysis to which a partisan Senate and Congress could subject to executive arm, and destroy the principle of executive responsibility, and separation of the powers sought for by the framers of our government, if the President had no power of removal save by consent of the Senate. It was an attempt to redistribute the powers and minimize those of the President.\n After President Johnson's term ended, the injury and invalidity of the Tenure of Office Act in its radical innovation were immediately recognized by the executive and objected to. General Grant, succeeding Mr. Johnson \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 168]\n\u00a0\n in the presidency, earnestly recommended in his first message the total repeal of the act, saying:\n'It may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from leaving on the statute books the so-called 'Tenure of Office Acts,' and to earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution, when providing that appointments made by the President should receive the consent of the Senate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office persons placed there by federal appointment against the will of the President. The law is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of the government. What faith can an executive put in officials forced upon him, and those, too, whom he has suspended for reason? How will such officials be likely to serve an administration which they know does not trust them?' 9 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 3992.\n\n While in response to this a bill for repeal of that act passed the House, it failed in the Senate, and, though the law was changed, it still limited the presidential power of removal. The feeling growing out of the controversy with President Johnson retained the act on the statute book until 1887, when if was repealed. 24 Stat. 500, c. 353. During this interval, on June 8, 1872, Congress passed an act reorganizing and consolidating the Post Office Department, and provided that the Postmaster General and his three assistants should be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and might be removed in the same manner. 17 Stat. 284, c. 335,  2. In 1876 the act here under discussion was passed, making the consent of the Senate necessary both to the appointment and removal of first, second, and third class postmasters. 19 Stat. 80, c. 179,  6 (Comp. St.  7190).\n In the same interval, in March, 1886, President Cleveland, in discussing the requests which the Senate had \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 169]\n\u00a0\n made for his reasons for removing officials, and the assumption that the Senate had the right to pass upon those removals and thus to limit the power of the President, said:\n'I believe the power to remove or suspend such officials is vested in the President alone by the Constitution, which in express terms provides that 'the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America,' and that 'he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'\n\n'The Senate belongs to the legislative branch of the government. When the Constitution by express provision superadded to its legislative duties the right to advise and consent to appointments to office and to sit as a court of impeachment, it conferred upon that body all the control and regulation of executive action supposed to be necessary for the safety of the people; and this express and special grant of such extraordinary powers, not in any way related to or growing out of general senatorial duties, and in itself a departure from the general plan of our government, should be held, under a familiar maxim of construction, to exclude every other right of interference with executive functions.'\n\n 11 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 4964.\n The attitude of the Presidents on this subject has been unchanged and uniform to the present day whenever an issue has clearly been raised. In a message withholding his approval of an act which he thought infringed upon the executive power of removal, President Wilson said:\n'It has, I think, always been the accepted construction of the Constitution that the power to appoint officers of this kind carries with it, as an incident, the power to remove. I am convinced that the Congress is without constitutional power to limit the appointing power and its incident, the power of removal, derived from the Constitution.' 59 Congressional Record (June 4, 1920) 8609. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 170]\n\u00a0\n And President Coolidge, in a message to Congress, in response to a resolution of the Senate that it was the sense of that body that the President should immediately request the resignation of the then Secretary of the Navy, replied:\n\n'No official recognition can be given to the passage of the Senate resolution relative to their opinion concerning members of the Cabinet or other officers under executive control.\n\n'... The dismissal of an officer of the government, such as is involved in this case, other than by impeachment, is exclusively an executive function. I regard this as a vital principle of our government.'\n\n 65 Congressional Record (Feb. 13, 1924) 2335.\n In spite of the foregoing presidential declarations, it is contended that, since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act, there has been general acquiescence by the executive in the power of Congress to forbid the President alone to remove executive officers, an acquiescence which has changed any formerly accepted constitutional construction to the contrary. Instances are cited of the signed approval by President Grant and other Presidents of legislation in derogation of such construction. We think these are all to be explained, not by acquiescence therein, but by reason of the otherwise valuable effect of the legislation approved. Such is doubtless the explanation of the executive approval of the act of 1876, which we are considering, for it was an appropriation act on which the section here in question was imposed as a rider.\n In the use of congressional legislation to support or change a particular construction of the Constitution by acquiescence, its weight for the purpose must depend not only upon the nature of the question, but also upon the attitude of the executive and judicial branches of the government, as well as upon the number of instances in the execution of the law in which opportunity for objec- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 171]\n\u00a0\n tion in the courts or elsewhere is afforded. When instances which actually involve the question are rare or have not in fact occurred, the weight of the mere presence of acts on the statute book for a considerable time as showing general acquiescence in the legislative assertion of a questioned power is minimized. No instance is cited to us where any question has arisen respecting a removal of a Postmaster General or one of his assistants. The President's request for resignations of such officers is generally complied with. The same thing is true of the postmasters. There have been many executive removals of them and but few protests or objections. Even when there has been a refusal by a postmaster to resign, removal by the President has been followed by a nomination of a successor and the Senate's confirmation has made unimportant the inquiry as to the necessity for the Senate's consent to the removal.\n Other acts of Congress are referred to which contain provisions said to be inconsistent with the 1789 decision. Since the provision for an Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, many administrative boards have been created whose members are appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and in the statutes creating them have been provisions for the removal of the members for specified causes. Such provisions are claimed to be inconsistent with the independent power of removal by the President. This, however, is shown to be unfounded by the case of Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311\n, 23 S. Ct. 535 (1903). That concerned an act creating a board of general appraisers, 26 Stat. 131, 136, c. 407,  12 (Comp. St.  5593), and provided for their removal for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The President removed an appraiser without notice or hearing. It was forcibly contended that the affirmative language of the statute implied the negative of the power to remove except for cause and after a hearing. This would \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 172]\n\u00a0\n have been the usual rule of construction, but the court declined to apply it. Assuming for the purpose of that case only, but without deciding, that Congress might limit the President's power to remove, the court held that, in the absence of constitutional or statutory provision otherwise, the President could by virtue of his general power of appointment remove an officer, though appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and notwithstanding specific provisions for his removal for cause, on the ground that the power of removal inhered in the power to appoint. This is an indication that many of the statutes cited are to be reconciled to the unrestricted power of the President to remove, if he chooses to exercise his power.\n There are other later acts pointed out in which doubtless the inconsistency with the independent power of the President to remove is clearer, but these cannot be said to have really received the acquiescence of the executive branch of the government. Whenever there has been a real issue made in respect to the question of presidential removals, the attitude of the executive in Congressional message has been clear and positive against the validity of such legislation. The language of Mr. Cleveland in 1886, 20 years after the Tenure of Office Act, in his controversy with the Senate in respect to his independence of that body in the matter of removing inferior officers appointed by him and confirmed by the Senate, was quite as pronounced as that of General Jackson in a similar controversy in 1835. Mr. Wilson in 1920 and Mr. Coolidge in 1924 were quite as all-embracing in their views of the power of removal as General Grant in 1869, and as Mr. Madison and Mr. John Adams in 1789.\n The fact seems to be that all departments of the government have constantly had in mind, since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act, that the question of power of removal by the President of officers appointed by him \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 173]\n\u00a0\n with the Senate's consent has not been settled adversely to the legislative action of 1789, but, in spite of congressional action, has remained open until the conflict should be subjected to judicial investigation and decision.\n The action of this court cannot be said to constitute assent to a departure from the legislative decision of 1789, when the Parsons and Shurtleff Cases, one decided in 1897, and the other in 1903, are considered, for they certainly leave the question open. Wallace v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 541\n, 42 S. Ct. 221. Those cases indicate no tendency to depart from the view of the First Congress. This court has since the Tenure of Office Act manifested an earnest desire to avoid a final settlement of the question until it should be inevitably presented, as it is here.\n An argument ab inconvenienti has been made against our conclusion in favor of the executive power of removal by the President, without the consent of the Senate, that it will open the door to a reintroduction of the spoils system. The evil of the spoils system aimed at in the Civil Service Law and its amendments is in respect to inferior offices. It has never been attempted to extend that law beyond them. Indeed Congress forbids its extension to appointments confirmed by the Senate, except with the consent of the Senate. Act of January 16, 1883, 22 Stat. 403, 406, c. 27, sec. 7 (Comp. St.  3278). Reform in the federal civil service was begun by the Civil Service Act of 1883. It has been developed from that time, so that the classified service now includes a vast majority of all the civil officers. It may still be enlarged by further legislation. The independent power of removal by the President alone under present conditions works no practical interference with the merit system. Political appointments of inferior officers are still maintained in one important class, that of the first, second, and third class postmasters, collectors of internal revenue, marshals, collectors of customs, and other officers of that \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 174]\n\u00a0\n kind distributed through the country. They are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. It is the intervention of the Senate in their appointment, and not in their removal, which prevents their classification into the merit system. If such appointments were vested in the heads of departments to which they belong, they could be entirely removed from politics, and that is what a number of Presidents have recommended. President Hayes, whose devotion to the promotion of the merit system and the abolition of the spoils system was unquestioned, said in his Fourth annual message of December 6, 1880, that the first step to improvement in the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and the executive on the matter of appointments and he recommended the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act of 1867 for this purpose. 10 and 11 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 4555-4557. The extension of the merit system rests with Congress.\n What, then, are the elements that enter into our decision of this case? We have, first, a construction of the Constitution made by a Congress which was to provide by legislation for the organization of the government in accord with the Constitution which had just then been adopted, and in which there were, as Representatives and Senators, a considerable number of those who had been members of the convention that framed the Constitution and presented it for ratification. It was the Congress that launched the government. It was the Congress that rounded out the Constitution itself by the proposing of the first 10 amendments, which had in effect been promised to the people as a consideration for the ratification. It was the Congress in which Mr. Madison, one of the first in the framing of the Constitution, led also in the organization of the government under it. It was a Congress whose constitutional decisions have always been regarded, as they should be regarded, as of the greatest \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 175]\n\u00a0\n weight in the interpretation of that fundamental instrument. This construction was followed by the legislative department and the executive department continuously for 73 years, and this, although the matter in the heat of political differences between the executive and the Senate in President Jackson's time, was the subject of bitter controversy, as we have seen. This court has repeatedly laid down the principle that a contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution, when the founders of our government and framers of our Constitution were actively participating in public affairs, acquiesced in for a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given its provisions. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299, 309; Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 351; Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 420; Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 544, 621 (10 L. Ed. 1060); Cooley v. Board of Wardens, etc., 12 How. 299, 315; Burrow-Giles Lithographing Company v. Sarony, \n111 \nU.S. 53, 57\n, 4 S. Ct. 279; Ames v. Kansas, \n111 U.S. 449\n, 463-469, 4 S. Ct. 437; The Laura, \n114 \nU.S. 411, 416\n, 5 S. Ct. 881; Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 297\n, 8 S. Ct. 1370; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 28\n, 33 S., 35, 13 S. Ct. 3; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 56\n, 20 S. Ct. 747; Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 308\n, 21 S. Ct. 648; Ex parte Grossman, \n267 \nU.S. 87, 118\n, 45 S. Ct. 332, 38 A. L. R. 131.\n We are now asked to set aside this construction thus buttressed and adopt an adverse view, because the Congress of the United States did so during a heated political difference of opinion between the then President and the majority leaders of Congress over the reconstruction measures adopted as a means of restoring to their proper status the states which attempted to withdraw from the Union at the time of the Civil War. The extremes to which the majority in both Houses carried legislative measures in that matter are now recognized by all who calmly review the history of that episode in our government leading to articles of impeachment against President Johnson and his acquittal. Without animadvert- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 176]\n\u00a0\n ing on the character of the measures taken, we are certainly justified in saying that they should not be given the weight affecting proper constitutional construction to be accorded to that reached by the First Congress of the United States during a political calm and acquiesced in by the whole government for three-quarters of a century, especially when the new construction contended for has never been acquiesced in by either the executive or the judicial departments. While this court has studiously avoided deciding the issue until it was presented in such a way that it could not be avoided, in the references it has made to the history of the question, and in the presumptions it has indulged in favor of a statutory construction not inconsistent with the legislative decision of 1789, it has indicated a trend of view that we should not and cannot ignore. When on the merits we find our conclusion strongly favoring the view which prevailed in the First Congress, we have no hesitation in holding that conclusion to be correct; and it therefore follows that the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, in so far as it attempted to prevent the President from removing executive officers who had been appointed by him by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was invalid, and that subsequent legislation of the same effect was equally so.\n For the reasons given, we must therefore hold that the provision of the law of 1876 by which the unrestricted power of removal of first-class postmasters is denied to the President is in violation of the Constitution and invalid. This leads to an affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Claims.\n Before closing this opinion we wish to express the obligation of the court to Mr. Pepper for his able brief and argument as a friend of the court. Undertaken at our request, our obligation is none the less, if we find ourselves obliged to take a view adverse to his. The strong presentation of arguments against the conclusion of the court \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 177]\n\u00a0\n is of the utmost value in enabling the court to satisfy itself that it has fully considered all that can be said.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 178]\n\u00a0\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n The following provisions of the act making appropriations for the Post Office Department, approved July 12, 1876 (chapter 179, 19 Stat. 78, 80 (Comp. St.  7189, 7190)) have not been repealed or superseded.\n'Sec. 5. That the postmasters shall be divided into four classes ( based on annual compensation). ...\n\n'See. 6. Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law; and postmasters of the fourth class shall be appointed and may be removed by the Postmaster General, by whom all appointments and removals shall be notified to the Auditor for the Post Office Department.'\n\n The President nominated and with consent of the Senate appointed Frank S. Myers first-class postmaster at Portland, Or., for four years, commencing July 21, 1917, and undertook to remove him February 3, 1920. The Senate has never approved the removal. Myers protested, asserted illegality of the order, refused to submit, and was ejected. He sued to recover the prescribed salary for the period between February 3, 1920, and July 21, 1921. Judgment must go against the United States unless the President acted within powers conferred by the Constitution.\n II. May the President oust at will all postmasters appointed with the Senate's consent for definite terms under an act which inhibits removal without consent of that body? May he approve a statute which creates an inferior office and prescribes restrictions on removal, appoint an incumbent, and then remove without regard to the restrictions? Has he power to appoint to an inferior office for a definite term under an act which prohibits removal except as therein specified, and then arbitrarily \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 179]\n\u00a0\n dismiss the incumbent and deprive him of the emoluments? I think there is no such power. Certainly it is not given by any plain words of the Constitution; and the argument advanced to establish it seems to me forced and unsubstantial.\n A certain repugnance must attend the suggestion that the President may ignore any provision of an act of Congress under which he has proceeded. He should promote and not subvert orderly government. The serious evils which followed the practice of dismissing civil officers as caprice or interest dictated, long permitted under congressional enactments, are known to all. It brought the public service to a low estate and caused insistent demand for reform. 'Indeed, it is utterly impossible not to feel, that, if this unlimited power of removal does exist, it may be made, in the hands of a bold and designing man, of high ambition and feeble principles, an instrument of the worst oppression and most vindictive vengenance.' Story on the Constitution,  1539.\n During the notable Senate debate of 1835 (Debates, 23d Cong., 2d Sess .) experienced statesmen pointed out the very real dangers and advocated adequate restraint, through congressional action, upon the power which statutes then permitted the President to exercise.\n Mr. Webster declared (page 469):\n'I deem this degree of regulation, at least, necessary, unless we are willing to submit all these officers to an absolute and perfectly irresponsible removing power, a power which, as recently exercised, tends to turn the whole body of public officers into partisans, dependents, favorites, sycophants, and man-worshippers.'\n\n Mr. Clay asserted (Id. 515):\n'The power of removal, as now exercised, is nowhere in the Constitution expressly recognized. The only mode of displacing a public officer for which it does provide is by impeachment. But it has been argued on this occasion, that it is a sovereign power, an inherent power, and an executive power, and, there- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 180]\n\u00a0\n fore, that it belongs to the President. Neither the premises nor the conclusion can be sustained. If they could be, the people of the United States have all along totally misconceived the nature of their government, and the character of the office of their supreme magistrate. Sovereign power is supreme power; and in no instance whatever is there any supreme power vested in the President. Whatever sovereign power is, if there be any, conveyed by the Constitution of the United States, is vested in Congress, or in the President and Senate. The power to declare war, to lay taxes, to coin money, is vested in Congress; and the treaty-making power in the President and Senate. The Postmaster General has the power to dismiss his deputies. Is that a sovereign power or has he any?\n\n'Inherent power! That is a new principle to enlarge the powers of the general government. ... The partisans of the executive have discovered a third and more fruitful source of power. Inherent power! Whence is it derived? The Constitution created the office of President, and made it just what it is. It had no powers prior to its existence. It can have none but those which are conferred upon it by the instrument which created it, or laws passed in pursuance of that instrument. Do gentlemen mean by inherent power, such power as is exercised by the monarchs or chief magistrates of other countries? If that be their meaning they should avow it.'\n\n And Mr. Calhoun argued (Id. 553):\n'Hear what that sacred instrument says: 'Congress shall have power ... to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers' (those granted to Congress itself) 'and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.' Mark the fullness of the expression. Congress shall have \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 181]\n\u00a0\n power to make all laws, not only to carry into effect the powers expressly delegated to itself, but those delegated to the government or any department or officer thereof; and of course comprehends the power to pass laws necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers expressly granted to the executive department. It follows, of course, to whatever express grant of power to the executive the power of dismissal may be supposed to attach, whether to that of seeing the law faithfully executed, or to the still more comprehensive grant, as contended for by some, vesting executive powers in the President, the mere fact that it is a power appurtenant to another power, and necessary to carry it into effect, transfers it, by the provisions of the Constitution cited, from the executive to Congress, and places it under the control of Congress, to be regulated in the manner which it may judge best.'\n\n The long struggle for civil service reform and the legislation designed to insure some security of official tenure ought not to be forgotten. Again and again Congress has enacted statutes prescribing restrictions on removals, and by approving them many Presidents have affirmed its power therein.\n The following are some of the officers who have been or may be appointed with consent of the Senate under such restricting statutes:\n Members of the Interstate Commerce Commission, Board of General Appraisers, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Trade Commission, Tariff Commission, Shipping Board, Federal Farm Loan Board, Railroad Labor Board; officers of the Army and Navy; Comptroller General; Postmaster General and his assistants; Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes; judge of the United States Court for China; judges of the Court of Claims, established in 1855, the judges to serve 'during good behavior'; judges of territorial (statutory) courts; judges of the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 182]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court and Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (statutory courts), appointed to serve 'during good behavior.' Also members of the Board of Tax Appeals provided for by the Act of February 26, 1926, to serve for 12 years, who 'shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, solely on the grounds of fitness to perform the duties of the office. Members of the board may be removed by the President, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.'\n Every one of these officers, we are now told in effect, holds his place subject to the President's pleasure or caprice. \n2\n And it is further said, that Congress cannot create any office to be filled through appointment by the President with consent of the Senate-except judges of the Supreme, Circuit and District (constitutional) courts-and exempt the incumbent from arbitrary dismissal. These questions press for answer; and thus the cause becomes of uncommon magnitude.\n III. Nothing short of language clear beyond serious disputation should be held to clothe the President with authority wholly beyond congressional control arbitrarily to dismiss every officer whom he appoints except a few judges. There are no such words in the Constitution, and the asserted inference conflicts with the heretofore accepted theory that this government is one of carefully enumerated powers under an intelligible charter.\n'This instrument contains an enumeration of powers expressly granted.' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 187.\n\n'Nor should it ever be lost sight of that the government of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 183]\n\u00a0\n the United States is one of limited and enumerated powers, and that a departure from the true import and sense of its powers is pro tanto the establishment of a new Constitution. It is doing for the people what they have not chosen to do for themselves. It is usurping the functions of a legislator, and deserting those of an expounder of the law. Arguments drawn from impolicy or inconvenience ought here to be of no weight. The only sound principle is to declare, 'ita lex scripta est,' to follow, and to obey. Nor, if a principle so just and conclusive could be overlooked, could there well be found a more unsafe guide in practice than mere policy and convenience.' Story on the Constitution,  426.\n\n If the phrase 'executive power' infolds the one now claimed, many others heretofore totally unsuspected may lie there awaiting future supposed necessity, and no human intelligence can define the field of the President's permissible activities. 'A masked battery of constructive powers would complete the destruction of liberty.'\n IV. Constitutional provisions should be interpreted with the expectation that Congress will discharge its duties no less faithfully than the executive will attend to his. The Legislature is charged with the duty of making laws for orderly administration obligatory upon all. It possesses supreme power over national affairs and may wreck as well as speed them. It holds the purse; every branch of the government functions under statutes which embody its will; it may impeach and expel all civil officers. The duty is upon it 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' all powers of the federal government. We have no such thing as three totally distinct and independent departments; the others must look to the legislative for direction and \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 184]\n\u00a0\n support. 'In republican government the legislative authority necessarily predominates.' The Federalist, XLVI, XVII. Perhaps the chief duty of the President is to carry into effect the will of Congress through such instrumentalities as it has chosen to provide. Arguments, therefore, upon the assumption that Congress may willfully impede executive action are not important.\n The Constitution provides:\n'Article 1,  1. All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. ...\n\n'Sec. 2. ... The House of Representatives ... shall have the sole power of impeachment.\n\n'Sec. 3. ... The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. ...\n\n'Sec. 8. The Congress shall have power ... to establish post offices and post roads; ... to raise and support armies ...; to provide and maintain a navy; to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; ... to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.'\n\n'Art. 2,  1. The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States. ...\n\n'Sec. 2. The President shall be commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States. He may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices; and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons, for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\n\n'He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur; and he shall nomi- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 185]\n\u00a0\n nate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law. But the Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.\n\n'The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions, which shall expire at the end of their next session.\n\n'Sec. 3. He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the state of the Union; and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. He may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper. He shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers. He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and shall commission all the officers of the United States.'\n\n'Art. 3,  1. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish. ...\n\n'Sec. 2. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority. ...'\n\n V. For the United States it is asserted: Except certain judges, the President may remove all officers whether ex- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 186]\n\u00a0\n ecutive or judicial appointed by him with the Senate's consent, and therein he cannot be limited or restricted by Congress. The argument runs thus: The Constitution gives the President all executive power of the national government, except as this is checked or controlled by some other definite provision; power to remove is executive and unconfined; accordingly, the President may remove at will. Further, the President is required to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; he cannot do this unless he may remove at will all officers whom he appoints; therefore he has such authority.\n The argument assumes far too much. Generally, the actual ouster of an officer is executive action; but to prescribe the conditions under which this may be done is legislative. The act of hanging a criminal is executive; but to say when and where and how he shall be hanged is clearly legislative. Moreover, officers may be removed by direct legislation; the act of 1820 hereafter referred to did this. 'The essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other words, to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society; while the execution of the laws, and the employment of the common strength, either for this purpose, or for the common defense, seem to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate.' The Federalist, No. LXXIV.\n The Legislature may create post offices and prescribe qualifications, duties, compensation, and term. And it may protect the incumbent in the enjoyment of his term unless in some way restrained therefrom. The real question, therefore, comes to this: Does any constitutional provision definitely limit the otherwise plenary power of Congress over postmasters, when they are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate? The question is not the much-mooted one whether the Senate is part of the appointing power under the Constitution and therefore must participate in removals.\n Here the restriction \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 187]\n\u00a0\n is imposed by statute alone and thereby made a condition of the tenure. I suppose that beyond doubt Congress could authorize the Postmaster General to appoint all postmasters and restrain him in respect of removals.\n Concerning the insistence that power to remove is a necessary incident of the President's duty to enforce the laws, it is enough now to say: The general duty to enforce all laws cannot justify infraction of some of them. Moreover, Congress, in the exercise of its unquestioned power, may deprive the President of the right either to appoint or to remove any inferior officer, by vesting the authority to appoint in another. Yet in that event his duty touching enforcement of the laws would remain. He must utilize the force which Congress gives. He cannot, without permission, appoint the humblest clerk or expend a dollar of the public funds.\n It is well to emphasize that our present concern is with the removal of an 'inferior officer,' within article 2,  2, of the Constitution, which the statute positively prohibits without consent of the Senate. This is no case of mere suspension. The demand is for salary, and not for restoration to the service. We are not dealing with an ambassador, public minister, consul, judge, or 'superior officer.' Nor is the situation the one which arises when the statute creates an office without a specified term, authorizes appointment and says nothing of removal. In the latter event, under long-continued practice and supposed early legislative construction, it is now accepted doctrine that the President may remove at pleasure. This is entirely consistent with implied legislative assent; power to remove is commonly incident to the right to appoint when not forbidden by law. But there has never been any such usage where the statute prescribed restrictions. From its first session down to the last one Congress has consistently asserted its power to prescribe conditions concerning the removal of inferior officers. The executive \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 188]\n\u00a0\n has habitually observed them, and this court has affirmed the power of Congress therein. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n VI. Some reference to the history of postal affairs will indicate the complete control which Congress has asserted over them with general approval by the executive.\n The Continental Congress (1775) established a post office and made Benjamin Franklin Postmaster General, 'with power to appoint such and so many deputies, as to him may seem proper and necessary.' Under the Articles of Confederation (1781) Congress again provided for a post office and Postmaster General, with 'full power and authority to appoint a clerk, or assistant to himself, and such and so many deputy postmasters as he shall think proper.' The first Congress under the Constitution (1789) directed:\n'That there shall be appointed a Postmaster General; his powers and salary, and the compensation to the assistant or clerk and deputies which he may appoint, and the regulations of the post office shall be the same as they last were under the resolutions and ordinances of the late Congress. The Postmaster General to be subject to the direction of the President of the United States in performing the duties of his office, and in forming contracts for the transportation of the mail.' 1 Stat. 70.\n\n The act of 1792 (1 Stat. 232, 234) established certain post roads, prescribed regulations for the Department, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 189]\n\u00a0\n and continued in the Postmaster General sole power of appointment; but it omitted the earlier provision that he should 'be subject to the direction of the President of the United States in performing the duties of his office.'\n The Act of March 2, 1799 (1 Stat. 733) provided:\n'That there be established at the seat of Government of the United States, a General Post Office, under the direction of a Postmaster General. The Postmaster General shall appoint an assistant, and such clerks as may be necessary for performing the business of his office; he shall establish post offices, and appoint postmasters, at all such places as shall appear to him expedient, on the post roads that are or may be established by law.'\n\n This provision remained until 1836; and prior to that time all postmasters were appointed without designated terms and were subject to removal by the Postmaster General alone.\n In 1814 Postmaster General Granger appointed Senator Leib postmaster at Philadelphia, contrary to the known wishes of President Madison. Granger was removed; but Leib continued to hold his office.\n John Quincy Adams records in his Memoirs (January 5, 1822) that the President 'summoned an immediate meeting of the members of the administration, which was fully attended. It was upon the appointment of the postmaster at Albany.' A warm discussion arose, with much diversity of opinion concerning the propriety of the Postmaster General's request for the Presidents opinion concerning the proposed appointment. 'The President said he thought it very questionable whether he ought to interfere in the case at all.' Some members severely censured the Postmaster General for asking the President's opinion after having made up his own mind, holding it an attempt to shift responsibility. 'I said I did not see his conduct exactly in the same light. The law gave the appointment of all the postmasters exclusively \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 190]\n\u00a0\n to the Postmaster General; but he himself was removable from his own office at the pleasure of the President. Now Mr. Granger had been removed with disgrace by President Madison for appointing Dr. Leib postmaster at Philadelphia. Mr. Meigs, therefore, in determining to appoint General Van Rensselaer, not only exercised a right but performed a duty of his office; but, with the example of Mr. Granger's dismission before him, it was quite justifiable in him to consult the President's wish, with the declared intention of conforming to it. I thought I should have done the same under similar circumstances.'\n Act July 2, 1836,  33 (5 Stat. 80, 87):\n'That there shall be appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a deputy postmaster for each post office at which the commissions allowed to the postmaster amounted to one thousand dollars or upwards in the year ending the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, or which may, in any subsequent year, terminating on the thirtieth day of June, amount to or exceed that sum, who shall hold his office for the term of four years, unless sooner removed by the President.'\n\n This is the first act which permitted appointment of any postmaster by the President; the first also which fixed terms for them. It was careful to allow removals by the President, which otherwise, under the doctrine of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, would have been denied him. And by this legislation Congress itself terminated the services of postmasters who had been appointed to serve at will.\n The act of 1863 (12 Stat. 701) empowered the Postmaster General to appoint and commission all postmasters whose salary or compensation 'have been ascertained to be less than one thousand dollars.' In 1864 five distinct classes were created (13 Stat. 335); and the act of 1872,  63 ( 17 Stat. 292) provided:\n'That postmasters of the fourth and fifth class shall be appointed and may be removed \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 191]\n\u00a0\n by the Postmaster General, and all others shall be appointed and may be removed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law.'\n\n In 1874 (18 Stat. 231, 234) postmasters were divided into four classes according to compensation, and the statute directed that those 'of the first, second, and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law; and postmasters of the fourth class shall be appointed and may be removed by the Postmaster General, by whom all appointments and removals shall be notified to the Auditor for the Post Office Department.' This language reappears in section 6, Act July 12, 1876, supra.\n On July 1, 1925, there were 50,957 postmasters; 35,758 were of the fourth class.\n For 47 years (1789 to 1836) the President could neither appoint nor remove any postmaster. The act which first prescribed definite terms for these officers authorized him to do both. Always it has been the duty of the President to take care that the postal laws 'be faithfully executed'; but there did not spring from this any illimitable power to remove postmasters.\n VII. The written argument for the United States by the former Solicitor General avers that it is based on this premise:\n'The President's supervision of the executive branch of the government, through the necessary power of removal, has always been recognized, and is now recognized, alike by considerations of necessity and the theory of government as an executive power, and is clearly indicated in the text of the Constitution, even though the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 192]\n\u00a0\n power of removal is not expressly granted.'\n\n A discourse proceeding from that premise helps only because it indicates the inability of diligent counsel to discover a solid basis for his contention. The words of the Constitution are enough to show that the framers never supposed orderly government required the President either to appoint or to remove postmasters. Congress may vest the power to appoint and remove all of them in the head of a department and thus exclude them from presidential authority. From 1789 to 1836 the Postmaster General exercised these powers, as to all postmasters (Story on the Constitution,  1536), and the 35,000 in the fourth class are now under his control. For 40 years the President functioned and met his duty to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed' without the semblance of power to remove any postmaster. So I think the supposed necessity and theory of government are only vapors.\n VIII. Congress has authority to provide for postmasters and prescribe their compensation, terms and duties. It may leave with the President the right to appoint them with consent of the Senate or direct another to appoint. In the latter event United States v. Perkins, \n116 \nU.S. 483, 485\n, 6 S. Ct. 449, makes it clear that the right to remove may be restricted. But, so the argument runs, if the President appoints with consent of the Senate his right to remove cannot be abridged because article 2 of the Constitution vests in him the 'executive power,' and this includes an illimitable right to remove. The Constitution empowers the President to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, judges of the Supreme Court and superior officers, and no statute can interfere therein. But Congress may authorize both appointment and removal of all inferior officers without regard to the President's wishes-even in direct opposition to them. This important distinction \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 193]\n\u00a0\n must not be overlooked. And consideration of the complete control which Congress may exercise over inferior officers is enough to show the hollowness of the suggestion that a right to remove them may be inferred from the President's duty to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' He cannot appoint any inferior officer, however humble, without legislative authorization; but such officers are essential to execution of the laws. Congress may provide as many or as few of them as it likes. It may place all of them beyond the President's control; but this would not suspend his duty concerning faithful execution of the laws. Removals, however important, are not so necessary as appointments.\n IX. I find no suggestion of the theory that 'the executive power' of article 2,  1, includes all possible federal authority executive in nature unless definitely excluded by some constitutional provision, prior to the wellknown House debate of 1789, when Mr. Madison seems to have given it support. A resolution looking to the establishment of an executive department-Department of Foreign Affairs (afterwards State)- provided for a secretary, 'who shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and to be removable by the President.' Discussion arose upon a motion to strike out, 'to be removable by the President.' The distinction between superior and inferior officers was clearly recognized; also that the proposed officer was superior and must be appointed by the President with the Senate's consent. The bill prescribed no definite term-the incumbent would serve until death, resignation or removal. In the circumstances most of the speakers recognize the rule that where there is no constitutional or legislative restriction power to remove is incidental to that of appointment. Accordingly, they thought the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 194]\n\u00a0\n President could remove the proposed officer; but many supposed he must do so with consent of the Senate. They maintained that the power to appoint is joint.\n Twenty-four of the fifty-four members spoke and gave their views on the Constitution and sundry matters of expediency. The record fairly indicates that nine, including Mr. Madison, thought the President would have the right to remove an officer serving at will under direct constitutional grant; three thought the Constitution did not and although Congress might it ought not to bestow such power; seven thought the Constitution did not and Congress could not confer it; five were of opinion that the Constitution did not, but that Congress ought to confer it. Thus, only nine members said anything which tends to support the present contention, and fifteen emphatically opposed it.\n The challenged clause, although twice formally approved, was finally stricken out upon assurance that a new provision (afterwards adopted) would direct disposition of the official records 'whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States or in any other case of vacancy.' This was susceptible of different interpretations and probably did not mean the same thing to all. The majority said nothing. The result of the discussion and vote was to affirm that the President held the appointing power with a right of negation in the Senate, and that, under the commonly accepted rule, he might remove without concurrence of the Senate when there was no inhibition by Constitution or statute. That the majority did not suppose they had assented to the doctrine under which the President could remove inferior officers contrary to an inhibition prescribed by Congress is shown plainly enough by the passage later in the same session of two acts containing provisions wholly inconsistent with any such idea. Acts of August 7, 1789, and September 24, 1789, infra. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 195]\n\u00a0\n Following much discussion of Mr. Madison's motion of May 19, a special committee reported this bill to the House on June 2. Debates upon it commenced June 16 and continued until June 24, when it passed by 29 to 22. The Senate gave it great consideration, commencing June 25, and passed it July 18. with amendments accepted by the House July 20. The Diary of President John Adams (Works (1851 Ed.) vol. 3, p. 412) states that the Senate voted 9 to 9 and that the deciding vote was given by the Vice President in favor of the President's power to remove. He also states that Senator Ellsworth strongly supported the bill and Senator Paterson voted for it. These senators were members of the committee which drafted the Judiciary Bill spoken of below.\n It seems indubitable that when the debate began Mr. Madison did not entertain the extreme view concerning illimitable presidential power now urged upon us, and it is not entirely clear that he had any very definite convictions on the subject when the discussion ended. Apparently this notion originated with Mr. Vining, of Delaware, who first advanced it on Mry 19. Considering Mr. Madison's remarks (largely argumentative) as a whole, they give it small, if any, support. Some of them, indeed are distinctly to the contrary. He was author of the provision that the Secretary shall 'be removable by the President'; he thought it 'safe and expedient to adopt the clause' and twice successfully resisted its elimination-May 19 and June 19. He said:\n'I think it absolutely necessary that the President should have the power of removing from office. ... On the constitutionality of the declaration I have no manner of doubt.' 'He believed they (his opponents) would not assert, that any part of the Constitution declared that the only way to remove should be by impeachment; the contrary might be inferred, because Congress may establish offices by law; \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 196]\n\u00a0\n therefore, most certainly, it is in the discretion of the Legislature to say upon what terms the office shall be held, either during good behavior or during pleasure.' 'I have, since the subject was last before the House, examined the Constitution with attention, and I acknowledge that it does not perfectly correspond with the ideas I entertain of it from the first glance. ... I have my doubts whether we are not absolutely tied down to the construction declared in the bill. ... If the Constitution is silent, and it is a power the Legislature have a right to confer, it will appear to the world, if we strike out the clause, as if we doubted the propriety of vesting it in the President of the United States. I therefore think it best to retain it in the bill.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 197]\n\u00a0\n Writing to Edmund Randolph, June 17, 1789, Mr. Madison pointed out the precise point of the debate. 'A very interesting question is started: By whom officers appointed during pleasure by the President and Senate are to be displaced.' And on June 21, 1789, he advised Edmund Pendleton of the discussion, stated the four opinions held by members, and said:\n\n'The last opinion \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 198]\n\u00a0\n (the one he held) has prevailed, but is subject to various modifications, by the power of the Legislature to limit the duration of laws creating offices, or the duration of the appointments for filling them, and by the power over the salaries and appropriations.'\n\n Defending the Virginia Resolutions (of 1798) after careful preparation aided by long experience with national affairs, Mr. Madison emphasized the doctrine that \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 199]\n\u00a0\n the powers of the United States are 'particular and limited,' that the general phrases of the Constitution must not to so expounded as to destroy the particular enumerations explaining and limiting their meaning, and that latitudinous exposition would necessarily destroy the fundamental purpose of the founders. He continued to hold these general views. In his letters he clearly exposed the narrow point under consideration by the first Congress, also the modification to which his views were subject, and he supported, during the same session, the Judiciary Act and probably the Northwest Territory Act, which contained provisions contrary to the sentiment now attributed to him. It therefore seems impossible to regard what he once said in support of a contested measure as present authority for attributing to the executive those illimitable and undefinable powers which he thereafter reprobated. Moreover, it is the fixed rule that debates are not relied upon when seeking the meaning or effect of statutes.\n But, if it were possible to spell out of the debate and action of the first Congress on the bill to establish the Department of Foreign Affairs some support for the present claim of the United States, this would be of little real consequence, for the same Congress on at least two occasions took the opposite position, and time and time again subsequent Congresses have done the same thing. It would be amazing for this court to base the interpretation of a constitutional provision upon a single doubtful congressional interpretation, when there have been dozens of them extending through 135 years, which are directly to the contrary effect.\n Following the debate of 1789 it became the commonly approved view that the Senate is not a part of the appointing power; also it became accepted practice that the President might remove at pleasure all officers appointed by him when neither Constitution nor statute \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 200]\n\u00a0\n prohibited by prescribing a fixed term or otherwise. Prior to 1820 very few officers held for definite terms; generally they were appointed to serve at pleasure, and Mr. Madison seems always to have regarded this as the proper course. He emphatically disapproved the act of 1820, which prescribed such terms, and even doubted its constitutionality. Madison's Writings (1865 Ed.) vol. 3, p. 196. It was said that:\n'He thought the tenure of all subordinate executive officers was necessarily the pleasure of the chief by whom they were commissioned. If they could be limited by Congress to four years, they might to one- to a month-to a day-and the executive power might thus be annihilated.' Diary, John Quincy Adams (1875 Ed.) vol. VII, p. 425.\n\n During the early administrations removals were infrequent and for adequate reasons. President Washington removed ten officers; President John Adams, eight.\n Complying with a resolution of March 2, 1839, President Van Buren sent to the House of Representatives, March 13, 1840, 'a list of all ( civil) officers of the government deriving their appointments from the nomination of the President and concurrence of the Senate whose commissions are recorded in the Department of State and who have been removed from office since the 3d of March, 1789.' Document No. 132, 26th Cong., 1st Sess. Two hundred and eight had been removed, and, after a somewhat careful survey of the statutes, I think it true to say, that not one of these removals had been inhibited by Congress. On the contrary all were made with its consent, either implied from authorization of the appointment for service at pleasure or indicated by express words of the applicable statute. The act of 1789 authorized appointment of marshals for four years, removable at pleasure. The act of 1820 established definite terms for many officers, but directed that they 'shall be removable from office at pleasure.' The act of 1836 prescribed \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 201]\n\u00a0\n fixed terms for certain postmasters and expressly provided for removals by the President.\n A summary of the reported officers with commissions in the State Department who were removed, with the number in each class, is in the margin. \n5\n The Secretary of the Treasury reported that 24 officers in that department had been removed 'since the burning of the Treasury Building in 1833.' The Postmaster General reported that 13 postmasters appointed by the President had been dismissed (prior to 1836 all postmasters were appointed by the Postmaster General; after that time the President had express permission to dismiss those whom he appointed). Nine Indian Agents were removed. One hundred and thirty-nine commissioned officers of the army and 22 of the navy were removed. I find no restriction by Congress on the President's right to remove any of these officers. See Wallace v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 541\n, 42 S. Ct. 221.\n Prior to the year 1839, no President engaged in the practice of removing officials contrary to congressional di- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 202]\n\u00a0\n rection. There is no suggestion of any such practice which originated after that date.\n Rightly understood, the debate and act of 1789 and subsequent practice afford no support to the claim now advanced. In Marbury v. Madison, supra, this court expressly repudiated it, and that decision has never been overruled. On the contrary, Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311\n, 23 S. Ct. 535, clearly recognizes the right of Congress to impose restrictions.\n Concerning the legislative and practical construction following this debate Mr. Justice Story wrote (1833):\n'It constitutes perhaps the most extraordinary case in the history of the government of a power, conferred by implication on the executive by the assent of a bare majority of Congress, which has not been questioned on many other occasions. ... Whether the predictions of the original advocates of the executive power, or those of the opposers of it, are likely, in the future progress of the government, to be realized, must be left to the sober judgment of the community, and to the impartial award of time. If there has been any aberration from the true constitutional exposition of the power of removal ( which the reader must decide for himself), it will be difficult, and perhaps impracticable, after forty years' experience, to recall the practice to the correct theory. But, at all events, it will be a consolation to those who love the Union, and honor a devotion to the patriotic discharge of duty, that in regard to 'inferior officers' ( which appellation probably includes ninety-nine out of a hundred of the lucrative offices in the government), the remedy for any permanent abuse is still within the power of Congress, by the simple expedient of requiring the consent of the Senate to removals in such cases.' Story on the Constitution,  1543, 1544.\n\n Writing in 1826 (309, 310) Chancellor Kent affirmed:\n'The act (the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789,  27 (1 Stat. 87)) \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 203]\n\u00a0\n says that the marshal shall be removable at pleasure, without saying by whom; and on the first organization of the government, it was made a question whether the power of removal, in cases of officers appointed to hold at pleasure, resided anywhere but in the body which appointed, and of course whether the consent of the Senate was not requisite to remove. This was the construction given to the Constitution while it was pending for ratification before the state conventions, by the author of The Federalist. ... But the construction which was given to the Constitution by Congress, after great consideration and discussion, was different. In the act for establishing the Treasury Department, the Secretary was contemplated as being removable from office by the President. The words of the act are, 'That whenever the Secretary shall be removed from office by the President of the United States, or in any other case of vacancy in the office, the assistant shall act,' etc. This amounted to a legislative construction of the Constitution, and it has ever since been acquiesced in and acted upon, as of decisive authority in the case. It applies equally to every other officer of government appointed by the President and Senate, whose term of duration is not specially declared.'\n\n These great expounders had no knowledge of any practical construction of the Constitution sufficient to support the theory here advanced. This court knew nothing of it in 1803 when it decided Marbury v. Madison; and we have the assurance of Mr. Justice McLean (United States v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, 305) that it adhered to the view there expressed so long as Chief Justice Marshall lived. And neither Calhoun, nor Clay, nor Webster knew of any such thing during the debate of 1835, when they advocated limitation, by further legislation, of powers granted to the President by the act of 1820.\n If the remedy suggested by Mr. Justice Story and long supposed to be efficacious should prove to be valueless, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 204]\n\u00a0\n I suppose Congress may enforce its will by empowering the courts or heads of departments to appoint all officers except representatives abroad, certain judges, and a few 'superior' officers-members of the cabinet. And in this event the duty to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed' would remain, notwithstanding the President's lack of control. In view of this possibility, under plain provisions of the Constitution, it seems useless, if not, indeed, presumptuous, for courts to discuss matters of supposed convenience or policy when considering the President's power to remove.\n X. Congress has long and vigorously asserted its right to restrict removals and there has been no common executive practice based upon a contrary view. The President has often removed, and it is admitted that he may remove, with either the express or implied assent of Congress; but the present theory is that he may override the declared will of that body. This goes far beyond any practice heretofore approved or followed; it conflicts with the history of the Constitution, with the ordinary rules of interpretation, and with the construction approved by Congress since the beginning and emphatically sanctioned by this court. To adopt it would be revolutionary.\n The Articles of Confederation contained no general grant of executive power.\n The first Constitutions of the states vested in a Governor or President, sometimes with and sometimes without a council, 'the executive power,' 'the supreme executive power;' but always in association with carefully defined special grants, as in the federal Constitution itself. They contained no intimation of executive powers except those definitely enumerated or necessarily inferred therefrom of from the duty of the executive to enforce the laws. Speaking in the Convention, July 17, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 205]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Madison said:\n'The executives of the states are in general little more than cyphers; the Legislatures omnipotent.'\n\n In the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention no hint can be found of any executive power except those definitely enumerated or inferable therefrom of from the duty to enforce the laws. In the notes of Rufus King (June 1) upon the convention, this appears:\n'Wilson-an extive. ought to possess the powers of secresy, vigour & Dispatch-and to be so constituted as to be responsible-Extive. powers are designed for the execution of Laws, and appointing Officers not otherwise to be appointed-if appointments of Officers are made by a sing. Ex he is responsible for the propriety of the same. Not so where the Executive is numerous.\n\n'Mad: agrees wit. Wilson in his definition of executive powers- executive powers ex vi termini, do not include the Rights of war & peace &c. but the powers shd. be confined and defined-if large we shall have the Evils of elective Monarchies-probably the best plan will be a single Executive of long duration wth. a Council, with liberty to depart from their Opinion at his peril.'-Farrand, Records Fed. Con. v. 1, p. 70.\n\n If the Constitution or its proponents had plainly avowed what is now contended for there can be little doubt that it would have been rejected.\n The Virginia plan, when introduced, provided:\n'That a national executive be instituted; to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of ___ years, to receive punctually at stated times, a fixed compensation for the services rendered, in which no increase or diminution shall be made so as to affect the magistracy, existing at the time of increase or diminution, and to be ineligible a second time; and that besides a general authority to execute the national laws, it ought to enjoy the executive rights vested in Congress by the Confederation.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 206]\n\u00a0\n 'That the executive and a convenient number of the national judiciary, ought to compose a council of revision with authority to examine every act of the national legislature before it shall operate, and every act of a particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final; and that the dissent of the said council shall amount to a rejection, unless the act of the national legislature be again passed, or that of a particular legislature be again negatived by ___ of the members of each branch.'\n This provision was discussed and amended. When reported by the committee of the whole and referred to the committee on detail, June 13, it read thus:\n'Resolved, that a national executive be instituted to consist of a single person, to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of seven years, with power to carry into execution the national laws, to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for-to be ineligible a second time, and to be removable on impeachment and conviction of malpractices or neglect of duty-to receive a fixed stipend by which he may be compensated for the devotion of his time to public service to be paid out of the national treasury. That the national executive shall have a right to negative any legislative act, which shall not be afterwards passed unless by two-thirds of each branch of the national legislature.'\n\n The committee on detail reported:\n'Sec. 1. The executive power of the United States shall be vested in a single person,' etc.\n\n This was followed by section 2 with the clear enumeration of the President's powers and duties. Among them were these:\n'He shall from time to time give information to the Legislature of the state of the Union. ... He shall take care that the laws of the United States be duly and faithfully executed. ... He shall receive ambassadors. ... He shall be commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy.'\n\n Many of these \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 207]\n\u00a0\n were taken from the New York Constitution. After further discussion the enumerated powers were somewhat modified, and others were added, among them (September 7) the power 'to call for the opinions of the heads of departments, in writing.'\n It is beyond the ordinary imagination to picture 40 or 50 capable men, presided over by George Washington, vainly discussing, in the heat of a Philadelphia summer, whether express authority to require opinions in writing should be delegated to a President in whom they had already vested the illimitable executive power here claimed.\n The New Jersey plan:\n'That the United States in Congress be authorized to elect a federal executive to consist of ___ persons, to continue in office for the term or ___ years, to receive punctually at stated times a fixed compensation for their services, in which no increase or diminution shall be made so as to affect the persons composing the executive at the time of such increase or diminution, to be paid out of the federal treasury; to be incapable of holding any other office or appointment during their time of service and for ___ years thereafter; to be ineligible a second time, and removable by Congress on application by a majority of the executives of the several States; that the executives besides their general authority to execute the federal acts ought to appoint all federal officers not otherwise provided for, and to direct all military operations; provided that none of the persons composing the federal executive shall on any occasion take command of any troops, so as personally to conduct any enterprise as general or in other capacity.'\n\n The sketch offered by Mr. Hamilton:\n'The supreme executive authority of the United States to be vested in a governor to be elected to serve during good behavior-the election to be made by electors chosen by the people in the election districts aforesaid-the au- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 208]\n\u00a0\n thorities and functions of the executive to be as follows: to have a negative on all laws about to be passed, and the execution of all laws passed; to have the direction of war when authorized or begun; to have with the advice and approbation of the Senate the power of making all treaties; to have the sole appointment of the heads or chief officers of the Departments of Finance, War and Foreign Affairs; to have the nomination of all other officers (ambassadors to foreign nations included) subject to the approbation or rejection of the Senate; to have the power of pardoning all offences except treason; which he shall not pardon without the approbation of the Senate.'\n\n XI. The Federalist, Article LXXVI, by Mr. Hamilton, says:\n'It has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the Senate, in the business of appointments, that it would contribute to the stability of the administration. The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint. A change of the Chief Magistrate, therefore, would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected, if he were the sole disposer of offices. Where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new President would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him, by the apprehension that a discountenance of the Senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of discredit upon himself. Those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration will be most disposed to prize a provision, which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body, which, from the greater permanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government.' \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 209]\n\u00a0\n XII. Since the debate of June, 1789, Congress has repeatedly asserted power over removals; this court has affirmed the power, and practices supposed to be impossible have become common.\n\n Mr. Madison was much influenced by supposed expediency, the impossibility of keeping the Senate in constant session, etc.; also the extraordinary personality of the President. He evidently supposed it would become common practice to provide for officers without definite terms, to serve until resignation, done until 1820. The office under discussion doen until 1820. The office under discussion was a superior one, to be filled only by presidential appointment. He assumed as obviously true things now plainly untrue and was greatly influenced by them. He said:\n'The danger then consists merely in this: The President can displace from office a man whose merits require that he should be continued in it. What will be the motives which the President can feel for such abuse of his power, and the restraints that operate to prevent it? In the first place, he will be impeachable by this House, before the Senate for such an act of maladministration; for I contend that the wanton removal of meritorious officers would subject him to impeachment and removal from his own high trust. But what can be his motives for displacing a worthy man? It must be that he may fill the place with an unworthy creature of his own. ... Now if this be the case with an hereditary monarch, possessed of those high prerogatives and furnished with so many means of influence, can we suppose a President, elected for four years only, dependent upon the popular voice, impeachable by the Legislature, little, if at all, distinguished for wealth, personal talents, or influence from the head of the department himself; I say, will he bid defiance to all these considerations, and wantonly dismiss a meritorious and virtuous officer? \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 210]\n\u00a0\n Such abuse of power exceeds my conception. If anything takes place in the ordinary course of business of this kind, my imagination cannot extend to it on any rational principle.'\n\n We face as an actuality what he thought was beyond imagination and his argument must now be weighed accordingly. Evidently the sentiments which he then apparently held came to him during the debate and were not entertained when he left the Constitutional Convention, nor during his later years. It seems fairly certain that he never consciously advocated the extreme view now attributed to him by counsel. His clearly stated exceptions to what he called the prevailing view and his subsequent conduct repel any such idea.\n By an Act approved August 7, 1789 (chapter 8, 1 Stat. 50, 53) Congress provided for the future government of the Northwest Territory, originally organized by the Continental Congress. This statute directed:\n'The President shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint all officers which by the said ordinance were to have been appointed by the United States in Congress assembled, and all officers so appointed shall be commissioned by him; and in all cases where the United States in Congress assembled, might, by the said ordinance, revoke any commission or remove from any office, the President is hereby declared to have the same powers of revocation and removal.'\n\n The Ordinance of 1787 authorized the appointment by Congress of a Governor, 'whose commission shall continue in force for the term of three years, unless sooner revoked by Congress,' a secretary, 'whose commission shall continue in force for four years, unless sooner revoked,' and three judges, whose 'commissions shall continue in force during good behavior.' These were not constitutional judges. American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511. Thus Congress, at its first session, inhibited removal of judges \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 211]\n\u00a0\n and assented to removal of the first civil officers for whom it prescribed fixed terms. It was wholly unaware of the now-supposed construction of the Constitution which would render these provisions improper. There had been no such construction; the earlier measure and debate related to an officer appointed by legislative consent to serve at will, and whatever was said must be limited to that precise point.\n On August 18, 1789, the President nominated, and on the twentieth the Senate 'did advise and consent' to the appointment of the following officers for the territory: Arthur St. Clair, Governor; Winthrop Sargent, secretary; Samuel Holden Parsons, John Cleves Symmes, and William Barton, judges of the court.\n The bill for the Northwest Territory was a House measure, framed and presented July 16, 1789, by a special committee of which Mr. Sedgwick, of Massachusetts, was a member, and passed July 21 without roll call. The Senate adopted it August 4. The debate on the bill to create the Department of Foreign Affairs must have been fresh in the legislative mind, and it should be noted that Mr. Sedgwick had actively supported the power of removal when that measure was up.\n The Act of September 24, 1789 (chapter 20,  27, 1 Stat. 73, 87), provided for another civil officer with fixed term:\n'A marshal shall be appointed in and for each district for the term of four years, but shall be removable from office at pleasure, whose duty it shall be,' etc.\n\n This act also provided for district attorneys and an Attorney General without fixed terms and said nothing of removal. The Legislature must have understood that, if an officer be given a fixed term and nothing is said concerning removal, he acquires a vested right to the office for the full period; also that officers appointed without definite terms were subject to removal by the President at will, assent of Congress being implied. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 212]\n\u00a0\n This bill was a Senate measure, prepared by a committee of which Senators Ellsworth and Paterson were members and introduced June 12. It was much considered between June 22 and July 17, when it passed the Senate 14 to 6. During this same period the House bill to create the Department of Foreign Affairs was under consideration by the Senate, and Senators Ellsworth and Paterson both gave it support. The Judiciary Bill went to the House July 20, and there passed September 17. Mr. Madison supported it.\n If the theory of illimitable executive power now urged is correct, then the acts of August 7 and September 24 contained language no less objectionable than the original phrase in the bill to establish the Department of Foreign Affairs over which the long debate arose. As nobody objected to the provisions concerning removals and life tenure in the two later acts it seems plain enough that the First Congress never entertained the constitutional views now advanced by the United States. As shown by Mr. Madison's letter to Edmund Randolph, supra, the point under discussion was the power to remove officers appointed to serve at will. Whatever effect is attributable to the action taken must be confined to such officers.\n Congress first established courts in the District of Columbia by the Act of February 27, 1801, c. 15, 2 Stat. 103. This authorized three judges to be appointed by the President, with consent of the Senate, 'to hold their respective offices during good behavior.' The same tenure has been bestowed on all subsequent superior District of Columbia judges. The same act also provided for a marshal, to serve during four years, subject to removal at pleasure; for a district attorney without definite term, and 'such number of discreet persons to be justices of the peace, as the President of the United States shall from time to time think expedient, to con- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 213]\n\u00a0\n tinue in office five years.' Here, again, Congress undertook to protect inferior officers in the District from executive interference, and the same policy has continued down to this time. See Act of February 9, 1893, c. 74 (27 Stat. 434).\n The acts providing 'for the government of the territory of the United States south of the river Ohio' (1790), and for the organization of the territories of Indiana (1800), Illinois (1809), and Michigan (1805), all provided that the government should be similar to that established by the Ordinance of 1787 for the Northwest Territory. Judges for the Northwest Territory were appointed for life.\n The act establishing the territorial government of Wisconsin (1836) directed:\n'That the judicial power of the said Territory shall be vested in a Supreme Court, district courts, probate courts, and in justices of the peace. The Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice and two associate judges, any two of whom shall be a quorum, and who shall hold a term at the seat of government of the said territory annually, and they shall hold their offices during good behavior.'\n\n The organization acts for the territories of Louisiana (1804), Iowa ( 1838), Minnesota (1849), New Mexico (1850), Utah (1850), North Dakota ( 1861), Nevada (1861), Colorado (1861), and Arizona (1863) provided for judges 'to serve for four years.' Those for the organization of Oregon ( 1848), Washington (1853), Kansas (1854), Nebraska (1854), Idaho (1863), Montana (1864), Alaska (1884), Indian Territory (1889), and Oklahoma (1890) provided for judges 'to serve for four years, and until their successors shall be appointed and qualified.' Those for Missouri (1812), Arkansas ( 1819), Wyoming (1868), Hawaii (1900), and Florida (1822) provided that judges should be appointed to serve 'four years unless sooner removed,' 'four years unless sooner removed by \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 214]\n\u00a0\n the President,' 'four years unless sooner removed by the President with the consent of the Senate of the United States,' 'who shall be citizens of the Territory of Hawaii and shall be appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, and may be removed by the President,' and 'for the term of four years and no longer.'\n May 15, 1820, President Monroe approved the first general Tenure of Office Act (chapter 102, 3 Stat. 582). It directed:\n'All district attorneys, collectors of the customs, naval officers and surveyors of the customs, navy agents, receivers of public moneys for lands, registers of the land offices, paymasters in the army, the apothecary general, the assistant apothecaries general, and the commissary general of purchases, to be appointed under the laws of the United States, shall be appointed for the term of four years, but shall be removable from office at pleasure. (Prior to this time these officers were appointed without term to serve at will.)\n\n'Sec. 2. ... The commission of each and every of the officers named in the first section of this act, now in office, unless vacated by removal from office, or otherwise, shall cease and expire in the manner following: All such commissions, bearing date on or before the thirtieth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, shall cease and expire on the day and month of their respective dates, which shall next ensue after the thirtieth day of September next; all such commissions, bearing date after the said thirtieth day of September, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, and before the first day of October, one thousand eight hundred and sixteen, shall cease and expire on the day and month of their respective dates, which shall next ensue after the thirtieth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one. And all other such commissions shall cease \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 215]\n\u00a0\n and expire at the expiration of the term of four years from their respective dates.'\n\n Thus Congress not only asserted its power of control by prescribing terms and then giving assent to removals, but it actually removed officers who were serving at will under presidential appointment with consent of the Senate. This seems directly to conflict with the notion that removals are wholly executive in their nature.\n XIII. The claim advanced for the United States is supported by no opinion of this court, and conflicts with Marbury v. Madison (1803), supra, concurred in by all, including Mr. Justice Paterson, who was a conspicuous member of the Constitutional Convention and, as Senator from New Jersey, participated in the debate of 1789 concerning the power to remove and supported the bill to establish the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n By an original proceeding here Marbury sought a mandamus requiring Mr. Madison, then Secretary of State, to deliver a commission signed by President Adams which showed his appointment (under the Act of February 27, 1801) as justice of the peace for the District of Columbia, 'to continue in office five years.' The act contained no provision concerning removal. \n6\n As required by the circumstances, the court first considered Marbury's right to demand the commission and affirmed it. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'It is therefore decidedly the opinion of the court that, when a commission has been signed by the President, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 216]\n\u00a0\n the appointment is made, and that the commission is complete when the seal of the United States has been affixed to it by the Secretary of State.\n\n'Where an officer is removable at the will of the executive, the circumstance which completes his appointment is of no concern, because the act is at any time revocable, and the commission may be arrested, if still in the office. But when the officer is not removable at the will of the executive, the appointment is not revocable, and cannot be annulled. It has conferred legal rights which cannot be resumed.\n\n'The discretion of the executive is to be exercised until the appointment has been made. But, having once made the appointment, his power over the office is terminated in all cases where by law the officer is not removable by him. The right to the office is then in the person appointed, and he has the absolute, unconditional power of accepting or rejecting it.\n\n'Mr. Marbury, then, since his commission was signed by the President and sealed by the Secretary of State, was appointed, and as the law creating the office gave the officer a right to hold for five years, independent of the executive, the appointment was not revocable, but vested in the officer legal rights, which are protected by the laws of his country. (This freedom from executive interference had been affirmed by Representative Bayard in February, 1802, during the debate on repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801.)\n\n'To withhold his commission, therefore, is an act deemed by the court not warranted by law, but violative of a vested legal right. ...\n\n'The office of justice of peace in the District of Columbia is such an office (of trust, honor or profit). ... It has been created by special act of Congress, and has been secured, so far as the laws can give security to the person appointed to fill it, for five years. ...\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 217]\n\u00a0\n 'It is then the opinion of the court, first, that by signing the commission of Mr. Marbury the President of the United States appointed him a justice of peace for the county of Washington in the District of Columbia, and that the seal of the United States, affixed thereto by the Secretary of State, is conclusive testimony of the verity of the signature, and of the completion of the appointment, and that the appointment conferred on him a legal right to the office for the space of five years. ...\n'It has already been stated that the applicant has to that commission a vested legal right, of which the executive cannot deprive him. He has been appointed to an office, from which he is not removable at the will of the executive, and, being so appointed, he has a right to the commission which the Secretary has received from the President for his use.'\n\n The point thus decided was directly presentedand essential to proper disposition of the cause. If the doctrine now advanced had been approved, there would have been no right to protect, and the famous discussion and decision of the great constitutional question touching the power of the court to declare an act of Congress without effect would have been wholly out of place. The established rule is that doubtful constitutional problems must not be considered, unless necessary to determination of the cause. The sometime suggestion that the Chief Justice indulged an obiter dictum is without foundation. The court must have appreciated that, unless it found Marbury had the legal right to occupy the office irrespective of the President's will, there would be no necessity for passing upon the much-controverted and farreaching power of the judiciary to declare an act of Congress without effect. In the circumstances then existing it would have been peculiarly unwise to consider the second and more important question without first demonstrating the necessity therefor by ruling upon the first. Both points \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 218]\n\u00a0\n were clearly presented by the record, and they were decided in logical sequence. Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (7th Ed.) 231.7\n But, assuming that it was unnecessary in Marbury v. Madison to determine the right to hold the office, nevertheless this court deemed it essential and decided it. I cannot think this opinion is less potential than Mr. Madison's argument during a heated debate concerning an office without prescribed tenure.\n This opinion shows clearly enough why Congress, when it directed appointment of marshals for definite terms by the act of 1789, also took pains to authorize their removal. The specification of a term, without more, would have prevented removals at pleasure.\n We are asked by the United States to treat the definite holding in Marbury v. Madison that the plaintiff was not subject to removal by the President at will as mere dictum-to disregard it. But a solemn adjudication by this court may not be so lightly treated. For 120 years that case has been regarded as among the most important ever decided. It lies at the very foundation of our jurisprudence. Every point determined was deemed essential, and the suggestion of dictum, either idle or partisan exhortation, ought not to be tolerated. The point here involved was directly passed upon by the great Chief Justice, and we must accept the result, unless prepared to express direct disapproval and exercise the transient power which we possess to overrule our great predecessors; the opinion cannot be shunted.\n At the outset it became necessary to determine whether Marbury had any legal right which could, prima facie at least, create a justiciable or actual case arising under the laws of the United States. Otherwise, there would have \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 219]\n\u00a0\n been nothing more than a moot cause, the proceeding would have been upon an hypothesis, and he would have shown no legal right whatever to demand an adjudication on the question of jurisdiction and constitutionality of the statute. The court proceeded upon the view that it would not determine an important and far-reaching constitutional question unless presented in a properly justiciable cause by one asserting a clear legal right susceptible of protection. It emphatically declared, not by way of argument or illustration, but as definite opinion, that the appointment of Marbury 'conferred on him a legal right to the office for the space of five years,' beyond the President's power to remove, and, plainly on this premise, it thereupon proceeded to consider the grave constitutional question. Indeed, if Marbury had failed to show a legal right to protect or enforce, it could be urged that the decision as to invalidity of the statute lacked force as a precedent, because rendered upon a mere abstract question raised by a moot case. The rule has always been cautiously to avoid passing upon important constitutional questions, unless some controversy properly presented requires their decision.\n The language of Mr. Justice Matthews in Liverpool, etc., Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S. Ct. 352, 355 (28 L. Ed. 899), is pertinent:\n'If, on the other hand, we should assume the plaintiff's case to be within the terms of the statute, we should have to deal with it purely as an hypothesis, and pass upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress as an abstract question. That is not the mode in which this court is accustomed or willing to consider such questions. It has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies. In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 220]\n\u00a0\n rules, to which it has rigidly adhered-one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other, never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. These rules are safe guides to sound judgment. It is the dictate of wisdom to follow them closely and carefully.'\n\n Also the words of Mr. Justice Brewer in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Mason City, etc., Co., \n199 \nU.S. 160, 166\n, 26 S. Ct. 19, 20 (50 L. Ed. 134):\n'Of course, where there are two grounds, upon either of which the judgment of the trial court can be rested, and the appellate court sustains both, the ruling on neither is obiter, but each is the judgment of the court and of equal validity with the other. Whenever a question fairly arises is the course of a trial, and there is a distinct decision of that question, the ruling of the court in respect thereto can, in no just sense, be called mere dictum. Railroad Companies v. Schutte, \n103 U.S. 118\n (26 L. Ed. 327), in which this court said (page 143): 'It cannot be said that a case is not authority on one point because, although that point was properly presented and decided in the regular course of the consideration of the cause, something else was found in the end which disposed of the whole matter. Here the precise question was properly presented, fully argued and elaborately considered in the opinion. The decision on this question was as much a part of the judgment of the court as was that on any other of the several matters on which the case as a whole depended.\"\n\n And see Chicago, etc., Railway Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S. Ct. 400; United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 \nU.S. 250, 262\n, 31 S. Ct. 155; United States v. Title Insurance Co., \n265 \nU.S. 472, 486\n, 44 S. Ct. 621; Watson v. St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co. (C. C.) 169 F. 942, 944, 945.\n Although he was intensely hostile to Marbury v. Madison, and refused to recognize it as authoritative, I do not find that Mr. Jefferson ever controverted the view \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 221]\n\u00a0\n that an officer duly appointed for definite time, without more, held his place free from arbitrary removal by the President. If there had been any generally accepted opinion or practice under which he could have dismissed such an officer, as now claimed, that cause would have been a rather farcical proceeding, with nothing substantial at issue, since the incumbent could have been instantly removed. And, assuming such doctrine, it is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson would have been ignorant of the practical way to end the controversy-a note of dismissal or removal. Evidently he knew nothing of the congressional interpretation and consequent practice here insisted on. And this, notwithstanding Mr. Madison sat at his side.\n Mr. Jefferson's letters to Spencer Roane (1819) and George Hay (1807) give his views:\n'In the case of Marbury and Madison, the federal judges declared that commissions, signed and sealed by the President, were valid, although not delivered. I deemed delivery essential to complete a deed, which, as long as it remains in the hands of the party, is as yet no deed; it is in posse only, but not in esse, and I withheld delivery of the commissions.'\n\n I think it material to stop citing Marbury v. Madison as authority, and have it denied to be law:\n'(1) Because the judges, in the outset, disclaimed all cognizance of the case, although they then went on to say what would have been their opinion, had they had cognizance of it. This, then, was confessedly an extrajudicial opinion, and, as such, of no authority. ( 2) Because, had it been judicially pronounced, it would have been against law; for to a commission, a deed, a bond, delivery is essential to give validity. Until, therefore, the commission is delivered out of the hands of the executive and his agents, it is not his deed.'\n\n The judges did not disclaim all cognizance of the cause; they were called upon to determine the questions \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 222]\n\u00a0\n irrespective of the result reached; and, whether rightly or wrongly, they distinctly held that actual delivery of the commission was not essential. That question does not now arise; here the commission was delivered and the appointee took office.\n Ex parte Hennen (1839) 13 Pet. 230, 258 (10 L. Ed. 136), involved the power of a United States District Judge to dismiss at will the clerk whom he had appointed. Mr. Justice Thompson said:\n'The Constitution is silent with respect to the power of removal from office, where the tenure is not fixed. It provides that the judges, both of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior. But no tenure is fixed for the office of clerks. Congress has by law (3 U. S. Stat. 582) limited the tenure of certain officers to the term of four years (3 Story, 1790), but expressly providing that the officers shall, within that term, be removable at pleasure, which, of course, is without requiring any cause for such removal. The clerks of courts are not included within this law, and there is no express limitation in the Constitution, or laws of Congress, upon the tenure of the office.\n\n'All offices, the tenure of which is not fixed by the Constitution, or limited by law, must be held either during good behavior, or ( which is the same thing in contemplation of law) during the life of the incumbent, or must be held at the will and discretion of some department of the government, and subject to removal at pleasure.\n\n'It cannot, for a moment, be admitted, that it was the intention of the Constitution that those offices which are denominated inferior offices should be held during life; and, if removable at pleasure, by whom is such removal to be made. In the absence of all constitutional provision or statutory regulation, it would seem to be a sound and necessary rule to consider the power of removal as incident to the power of appointment. This power of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 223]\n\u00a0\n removal from office was a subject much disputed, and upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained, in the early history of this government. This related, however, to the power of the President to remove officers appointed with the concurrence of the Senate; and the great question was whether the removal was to be by the President alone, or with the concurrence of the Senate, both constituting the appointing power. No one denied the power of the President and Senate, jointly, to remove, where the tenure of the office was not fixed by the Constitution, which was a full recognition of the principle that the power of removal was incident to the power of appointment. But it was very early adopted, as the practical construction of the Constitution, that this power was vested in the President alone. And such would appear to have been the legislative construction of the Constitution. ...\n\n'It would be a most extraordinary construction of the law that all these offices were to be held during life, which must inevitably follow, unless the incumbent was removable at the discretion of the head of the department; the President has certainly no power to remove. These clerks fall under that class of inferior officers, the appointment of which the Constitution authorizes Congress to vest in the head of the department. The same rule, as to the power of removal, must be applied to offices where the appointment is vested in the President alone. The nature of the power, and the control over the officer appointed, does not at all depend on the source from which it emanates. The execution of the power depends upon the authority of law, and not upon the agent who is to administer it. And the Constitution has authorized Congress, in certain cases, to vest this power in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments; and all inferior officers appointed under each, by authority of law, must hold their office at the discretion \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 224]\n\u00a0\n of the appointing power. Such is the settled usage and practical construction of the Constitution and laws under which these offices are held.'\n\n United States v. Guthrie (1854) 17 How. 284, Goodrich had been removed from the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, territory of Minnesota, to which he had been appointed to serve 'during the period of four years.' He sought to recover salary for the time subsequent to removal through a mandamus to the Secretary of the Treasury. The court held this was not a proper remedy, and did not consider whether the President had power to remove a territorial judge appointed for a fixed term. The reported argument of counsel is enlightening; the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice McLean is important. He points out that only two territorial judges had been removed-the plaintiff Goodrich, in 1851, and William Trimble, May 20, 1830. The latter was judge of the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, appointed to 'continue in office for the term of four years, unless sooner removed by the President.'\n United States ex rel. Bigler v. Avery (1867) Fed. Cas. No. 14,481. This opinion contains a valuable discussion of the general doctrine here involved.\n United States v. Perkins (1886) \n116 \nU.S. 483, 485\n, 6 S. Ct. 449, 450 ( 29 L. Ed. 700), held that:\n'When Congress, by law, vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads of departments, it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest. The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enact in relation to the officers so appointed.'\n\n McAllister v. United States (1891) \n141 \nU.S. 174\n, 11 S. Ct. 949: Plaintiff was appointed District Judge for Alaska 'for the term of four years from the day of the date hereof, and until his successor shall be appointed and qualified, sub- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 225]\n\u00a0\n ject to the conditions prescribed by law.' He was suspended, and the Senate confirmed his successor. He sought to recover salary for the time between his removal and qualification of his successor. Section 1768, R. S ., authorized the President to suspend civil officers 'except judges of the courts of the United States.' This court reviewed the authorities and pointed out that judges of territorial courts were not judges of courts of the United States within section 1768, and accordingly were subject to suspension by the President as therein provided. This argument would have been wholly unnecessary, if the theory now advanced, that the President has illimitable power to remove, had been approved.\n In an elaborate dissent Mr. Justice Field, Mr. Justice Gray, and Mr. Justice Brown expressed the view that it was beyond the President's power to remove the judge of any court during the term for which appointed. They necessarily repudiated the doctrine of illimitable power.\n Parsons v. United States (1897) \n167 \nU.S. 324, 343\n, 17 S. Ct. 880: After a review of the history and cases supposed to be apposite, this court, through Mr. Justice Peckham, held that the President had power to remove Parsons from the office of district attorney, to which he had been appointed 'for the term of four years from the date hereof, subject to the conditions prescribed by law':\n'We are satisfied that its (Congress') intention in the repeal of the tenure of office sections of the Revised Statutes was again to concede to the President the power of removal if taken from him by the original Tenure of Office Act, and by reason of the repeal to thereby enable him to remove an officer when in his discretion he regards it for the public good, although the term of office may have been limited by the words of the statute creating the office.'\n\n He referred to the act of 1820 and suggested that the situation following it had been renewed by repeal of the Tenure of Office Act. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 226]\n\u00a0\n The opinion does express the view that by practical construction prior to 1820 the President had power to remove an officer appointed for a fixed term; but this is a clear mistake. In fact, no removals of such duly commissioned officers were made prior to 1820, and Marbury v. Madison expressly affirms that this could not lawfully be done. The whole discussion in Parsons' Case was futile, if the Constitution conferred upon the President illimitable power to remove. It was pertinent only upon the theory that by apt words Congress could prohibit removals, and this view was later affirmed by Mr. Justice Peckham in Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311\n, 23 S. Ct. 535. Apparently he regarded the specification of a definite term as not equivalent to positive inhibition of removal by Congress.\n Reagan v. United States (1901), \n182 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 21 S. Ct. 842, 845 (45 L. Ed. 1162): Reagan, a commissioner of the United States Court in Indian Territory, was dismissed by the judge, and sued to recover salary. He claimed that the judge's action was invalid, because the cause assigned therefor was not one of those prescribed by law. This court, by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said:\n'The inquiry is therefore whether there were any causes of removal prescribed by law, March 1, 1895 (28 Stat. 693, c. 145), or at the time of removal. It there were, then the rule would apply that where causes of removal are specified by Constitution or statute, as also where the term of office is for a fixed period, notice and hearing are essential. If there were not, the appointing power could remove at pleasure or for such cause as it deemed sufficient. ... The commissioners hold office neither for life, nor for any specified time, and are within the rule which treats the power of removal as incident to the power of appointment, unless otherwise provided. By chapters 45 and 46 (Mansf. Dig. Ark.) justices of the peace on conviction of the offenses enumerated are removable from office, but these necessarily do not \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 227]\n\u00a0\n include all causes which might render the removal of commissioners necessary or advisable. Congress did not provide for the removal of commissioners for the causes for which justices of the peace might be removed, and if this were to be rules otherwise by construction, the effect would be to hold the commissioners in office for life, unless some of those specially enumerated causes became applicable to them. We agree with the Court of Claims that this would be a most unreasonable construction, and would restrict the power of removal in a manner which there is nothing in the case to indicate could have been contemplated by Congress.'\n\n Shurtleff v. United States (1903) \n189 \nU.S. 311, 313\n, 23 S. Ct. 535, 536 (47 L. Ed. 828): The plaintiff sought to recover his salary as general appraiser. He was appointed to that office without fixed term, with consent of the Senate, and qualified July 24, 1890. The act creating the office provided that the incumbents 'shall not be engaged in any other business, avocation or employment, and may be removed from office at any time by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.' Shurtleff was dismissed May 3, 1899, without notice or charges and without knowledge of the reasons for the President's action. Through Mr. Justice Peckham the court said:\n'There is, of course, no doubt of the power of Congress to create such an office as is provided for in the above section. Under the provision that the officer might be removed from office at any time for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, we are of opinion that if the removal is sought to be made for those causes, or either of them, the officer is entitled to notice and a hearing. Reagan v. United States, \n182 U.S. 419\n, 425 (21 S. Ct. 842). ... The appellant contends that, because the statute specified certain causes for which the officer might be removed, it thereby impliedly excluded and denied the right to remove for any other cause, and that the President was \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 228]\n\u00a0\n therefore by the statute prohibited from any removal excepting for the causes, or some of them therein defined. The maxim, 'Expressio unius est exclusio alterius,' is used as an illustration of the principle upon which the contention is founded. We are of opinion that as thus used the maxim does not justify the contention of the appellant. We regard it as inapplicable to the facts herein. The right of removal would exist if the statute had not contained a word upon the subject. It does not exist by virtue of the grant, but it inheres in the right to appoint, unless limited by Constitution or statute. It requires plain language to take it away.'\n\n The distinct recognition of the right of Congress to require notice and hearing, if removal were made for any specified cause, is of course incompatible with the notion that the President has illimitable power to remove. And it is well to note the affirmation that the right of removal inheres in the right to appoint.\n XIV. If the framers of the Constitution had intended 'the executive power,' in article 2,  1, to include all power of an executive nature, they would not have added the carefully defined grants of section 2. They were scholarly men, and it exceeds belief 'that the known advocates in the convention for a jealous grant and cautious definition of federal powers should have silently permitted the introduction of words and phrases in a sense rendering fruitless the restrictions and definitions elaborated by them.' Why say, the President shall be commander-in-chief; may require opinions in writing of the principal officers in each of the executive departments; shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons; shall give information to Congress concerning the state of the union; shall receive ambassadors; shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed-if all of these things and more had already \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 229]\n\u00a0\n been vested in him by the general words? The Constitution is exact in statement. Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540. That the general words of a grant are limited, when followed by those of special import, is an established canon; and an accurate writer would hardly think of emphasizing a general grant by adding special and narrower ones without explanation. 'An affirmative grant of special powers would be absured, as well as useless, if a general authority were intended.' Story on the Constitution,  448. 'The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined.' Federalist, No. XLIV. 'Affirmative words are often, in their operation, negative of other objects than those affirmed; and in this case a negative or exclusive sense must be given to them or they have no operation at all. It cannot be presumed that any clause in the Constitution is intended to be without effect, and therefore such a construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it.' Marbury v. Madison, at page 174.\n In his address to the Senate (February 16 1835) on 'The Appointing an Removing Power,' Mr. Webster considered and demolished the theory that the first section of article 2 conferred all executive powers upon the President except as therein limited (Webster's Works (Little, B. & Co., 1866), vol. 4, pp. 179, 186; Debates of Congress), and showed that the right to remove must be regarded as an incident to that of appointment. He pointed out the evils of uncontrolled removals, and, I think, demonstrated that the claim of illimitable executive power here advanced has no substantial foundation. The argument is exhaustive and ought to be conclusive. A paragraph from it follows:\n'It is true, that the Constitution declares that the executive power shall be vested in the President; but the first question which then arises is, What is executive power? What is the degree, and what are the limitations? Executive power is not a \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 230]\n\u00a0\n thing so well known, and so accurately defined, as that the written Constitution of a limited government can be supposed to have conferred it in the lump. What is executive power? What are its boundaries? What model or example had the framers of the Constitution in their minds, when they spoke of 'executive power'? Did they mean executive power as known in England, or as known in France, or as known in Russia? Did they take it as defined by Montesquieu, by Burlamaqui, or by De Lolme? All these differ from one another as to the extent of the executive power of government. What, then, was intended by 'the executive power'? Now, sir, I think it perfectly plain and manifest that, although the framers of the Constitution meant to confer executive power on the President, yet they meant to define and limit that power, and to confer no more than they did thus define and limit. When they say it shall be vested in a President, they mean that one magistrate, to be called a President, shall hold the executive authority; but they mean, further, that he shall hold this authority according to the grants and limitations of the Constitution itself.'\n\n XV. Article 1,  1, provides:\n'All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress,' etc.\n\n I hardly suppose, if the words 'herein granted' had not been inserted, Congress would possess all legislative power of Parliament, or of some theoretical government, except when specifically limited by other provisions. Such an omission would not have overthrown the whole theory of a government of definite powers, and destroyed the meaning and effect of the particular enumeration which necessarily explains and limits the general phrase. When this article went to the committee on style it provided, 'The legislative power shall be vested in a Congress,' \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 231]\n\u00a0\n etc. The words 'herein granted' were inserted by that committee September 12, and there is nothing whatever to indicate that anybody supposed this radically changed what already had been agreed upon. The same general form of words was used as to the legislative, executive, and judicial powers in the draft referred to the committee on style. The difference between the reported and final draft was treated as unimportant.\n'That the government of the United States is one of delegated, limited, and enumerated powers,' and 'that the federal government is composed of powers specifically granted, with the reservation of all others to the states or to the people.' are propositions which lie at the beginning of any effort rationally to construe the Constitution. Upon the assumption that the President, by immediate grant of the Constitution, is vested with all executive power without further definition or limitation, it becomes impossible to delimit his authority, and the field of federal activity is indefinitely enlarged. Moreover, as the Constitution authorizes Congress 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department of officer thereof,' it likewise becomes impossible to ascertain the extent of congressional power. Such a situation would be intolerable, chaotic indeed.\n\n If it be admitted that the Constitution by direct grant vests the President with all executive power, it does not follow that he can proceed in defiance of congressional action. Congress, by clear language, is empowered to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution powers vested in him. Here he was authorized only to appoint an officer of a certain kind, for a certain period, removable only in a certain way. He undertook to proceed under the law so far as agreeable, but repudiated the remainder. I submit that no warrant can be \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 232]\n\u00a0\n found for such conduct. This thought was stressed by Mr. Calhoun in his address to the Senate, from which quotation has been made, ante.\n XVI. Article 3,  1, provides:\n'The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.'\n\n But this did not endow the federal courts with authority to proceed in all matters within the judicial power of the federal government. Except as to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, it is settled that the federal courts have only such jurisdiction as Congress sees fit to confer. 'Only the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is derived directly from the Constitution. Every other court created by the general government derives its jurisdiction wholly from the authority of Congress. That body may give, withhold or restrict such jurisdiction at its discretion, provided it be not extended beyond the boundaries fixed by the Constitution. ... The Constitution simply gives to the inferior courts the capacity to take jurisdiction in the enumerated cases, but it requires an act of Congress to confer it.' Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 234\n, 43 S. Ct. 79, 82, 24 A. L. R. 1077.\n In sheldon et al. v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 449, it was argued that Congress could not limit the judicial power vested in the courts by the Constitution-the same theory, let it be observed, as the one now advanced concerning executive power. Replying, through Mr. Justice Grier, this court declared:\n'In the case of Turner v. Bank of North America (1799) 4 Dall. 10 (1 L. Ed. 718), it was contended, as in this case, that, as it was a controversy between citizens of different States, the Constitution gave the plaintiff a right to sue in the Circuit Court, notwithstanding he was an assignee within the restriction of the eleventh section of the Judiciary Act. But the court said: 'The political \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 233]\n\u00a0\n truth is that the disposal of the judicial power (except in a few specified instances) belongs to Congress, and Congress is not bound to enlarge the jurisdiction of the federal courts to every subject, in every form which the Constitution might warrant.' This decision was made in 1799; since that time, the same doctrine has been frequently asserted by this court, as may be seen in McIntire v. Wood, 7 Cranch, 506 (3 L. Ed. 420); Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 616 ( 9 L. Ed. 1181), Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 245 (11 L. Ed. 576).'\n\n The argument of counsel, reported in 4 Dall. (1 L. Ed. 718) is interesting. The bad reasoning, there advanced, although exposed a hundred years ago, is back again asking for a vote of confidence.\n XVII. The federal Constitution is an instrument of exact expression. Those who maintain that article 2,  1, was intended as a grant of every power of executive nature not specifically qualified or denied, must show that the term 'executive power' had some definite and commonly accepted meaning in 1787. This court has declared that it did not include all powers exercised by the King of England; and, considering the history of the period, none can say that it had then (or afterwards) any commonly accepted and practical definition. If any one of the descriptions of 'executive power' known in 1787 had been substituted for it, the whole plan would have failed. Such obscurity would have been intolerable to thinking men of that time.\n Fleming et al. v. Page, 9 How. 603, 618 (13 L. Ed. 276):\n'Neither is it necessary to examine the English decisions which have been referred to by counsel. It is true that most of the states have adopted the principles of english jurisprudence, so far as it concerns private and individual rights. And when such rights are in question, we habitually refer to the English decisions, not only with respect, but in many \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 234]\n\u00a0\n cases as authoritative. But in the distribution of political power between the great departments of government, there is such a wide difference between the power conferred on the President of the United States, and the authority and sovereignty which belong to the English crown, that it would be altogether unsafe to reason from any supposed resemblance between them, either as regards conquest in war, or any other subject where the rights and powers of the executive arm of the government are brought into question. Our own Constitution and form of government must be our only guide.'\n\n Blackstone, 190, 250, 252, affirms that 'the supreme executive power of these kingdoms is vested by out laws in a single person, the king or queen,' and that there are certain 'branches of the royal prerogative, which invest thus our sovereign lord, thus all-perfect and immortal in his kingly capacity, with a number of authorities and powers, in the execution whereof consists the executive part of government.' And he defines 'prerogative' as 'consisting (as Mr. Locke has well defined it) in the discretionary power of acting for the public good, where the positive laws are silent.'\n Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws, in 1787 the most popular and influential work on government says:\n'In every government there are three sorts of power: The legislative; the executive, in respect to things dependent on the law of nations; and the executive, in regard to matters that depend on the civil law. By virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power, and the other simply the executive power of the state.' \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 235]\n\u00a0\n Perhaps the best statement concerning 'executive power' known in 1787 was by Mr. Jefferson in his Draft of a Fundamental Constitution for the Commonwealth of Virginia, proposed in 1783 (Writings (Ford's Ed.) 1894, vol. 3, pp. 155, 156):\n\n'The executive powers shall be exercised by a Governor, who shall be chosen by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly. ... By executive powers, we mean no reference to those powers exercised under our former government by the crown as of its prerogative, nor that these shall be the standard of what may or may not be deemed the rightful powers of the Governor. We give them those powers only, which are necessary to execute the laws (and administer the government), and which are not in their nature either legislative or judiciary. The application of this idea must be left to reason. We do, however, expressly deny him the prerogative powers of erecting courts, offices, boroughs, corporations, fairs, markets, ports, beacons, light-house, and sea marks; of laying embargoes, of establishing precedence, of retaining within the state, or recalling to it any citizen thereof, and of making denizens, except so far as he may be authorized from time to time by the Legislature to exercise any of those powers.'\n\n This document was referred to by Mr. Madison in the Federalist, No. XLVIII.\n Substitute any of these descriptions or statements for the term 'executive power' in article 2,  1, and the whole plan becomes hopelessly involved-perhaps impossible.\n The term 'executive power' is found in most, if not all, of the state Constitutions adopted between 1776 and 1787. They contain no definition of it, but certainly it was not intended to signify what is now suggested. It meant in those instruments what Mr. Webster declared it signifies in the federal Constitution:\n'When they say it shall be vested in a President, they mean that one magistrate, to be called a President, shall hold the execu- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 236]\n\u00a0\n tive authority; but they mean, further, that he shall hold this authority according to the grants and limitations of the Constitution itself.'\n\n The Constitution of New York, much copled in the federal Constitution, declared:\n'The supreme executive power and authority of this state shall be vested in a Governor.'\n\n It then defined his powers and duties-among them, 'to take care that the laws are faithfully executed to the best of his ability.' It further provided 'that the treasurer of this state shall be appointed by act of the Legislature,' and intrusted the appointment of civil and military officers to a council. The Governor had no power to remove them, but apparently nobody thought he would be unable to execute the laws through officers designated by another.\n The Constitution of Virginia, 1776, provided:\n'The legislative, executive, and judiciary department, shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other.'\n\n It then imposed upon the two Houses of Assembly the duty of selecting by ballot judges, Attorney General, and treasurer.\n New Jersey Constitution, 1776:\n'That the Governor ... shall have the supreme executive power ... and act as captain-general and commander in chief of all the militia . ... That captains, and all other inferior officers of the militia, shall be chosen by the companies, in the respective counties; but field and general officers, by the council and assembly.'\n\n North Carolina Constitution, 1776:\n'That the legislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers of government, ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other . ... That the General Assembly shall, by joint ballot of both Houses, appoint judges of the Supreme Courts of law and equity, judges of admiralty, and Attorney General. ... That the General Assembly shall, by joint ballot of both Houses triennially appoint a Secretary for this state.' \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 237]\n\u00a0\n During the debate of 1789, Congressman Stone well said:\n\n'If gentlemen will tell us that powers, impliedly executive, belong to the President, they ought to go further with the idea, and give us a correct idea of executive power, as applicable to their rule. In an absolute monarchy there never has been any doubt with respect to implication; the monarch can do what he pleases. In a limited monarchy, the prince has powers incident to kingly prerogative. How far will a federal executive, limited by a Constitution, extend in implications of this kind? Does it go so far as absolute monarchy? Or is it confined to a restrained monarchy? If gentlemen will lay down their rule, it will serve us as a criterion to determine all questions respecting the executive authority of this government. My conception may be dull; but telling me that this is an executive power, raises no complete idea in my mind. If you tell me the nature of executive power, and how far the principle extends, I may be able to judge whether this has relation thereto, and how much is due to implication.'\n\n See The Federalist, No. XLVI.\n XVIII. In any rational search for answer to the questions arising upon this record, it is important not to forget-\n That this is a government of limited powers, definitely enumerated and granted by a written Constitution.\n That the Constitution must be interpreted by attributing to its words the meaning which they bore at the time of its adoption, and in view of commonly-accepted canons of construction, its history, early and long- continued practices under it, and relevant opinions of this court.\n That the Constitution endows Congress with plenary powers 'to establish post offices and post roads.'\n That, exercising this power during the years from 1789 to 1836, Congress provided for postmasters and vested the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 238]\n\u00a0\n power to appoint and remove all of them at pleasure in the Postmaster General.\n That the Constitution contains no words which specifically grant to the President power to remove duly appointed officers. And it is definitely settled that he cannot remove those whom he has not appointed- certainly they can be removed only as Congress may permit.\n That postmasters are inferior officers within the meaning of article 2,  2, of the Constitution.\n That from its first session to the last one Congress has often asserted its right to restrict the President's power to remove inferior officers, although appointed by him with consent of the Senate.\n That many Presidents have approved statutes limiting the power of the executive to remove, and that from the beginning such limitations have been respected in practice.\n That this court, as early as 1803, in an opinion never overruled and rendered in a case where it was necessary to decide the question, positively declared that the President had no power to remove at will an inferior officer appointed with consent of the Senate to serve for a definite term fixed by an act of Congress.\n That the power of Congress to restrict removals by the President was recognized by this court as late as 1903, in Shurtleff v. United States.\n That the proceedings in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the political history of the times, contemporaneous opinion, common canons of construction, the action of Congress from the beginning and opinions of this court, all oppose the theory that by vesting 'the executive power' in the President the Constitution gave him an illimitable right to remove inferior officers.\n That this court has emphatically disapproved the same theory concerning 'the judicial power' vested in the court by words substantially the same as those which \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 239]\n\u00a0\n vest 'the executive power' in the President. 'The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.' 'The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'\n That to declare the President vested with indefinite and illimitable executive powers would extend the field of his possible action far beyond the limits observed by his predecessors, and would enlarge the powers of Congress to a degree incapable of fair appraisement.\n Considering all these things, it is impossible for me to accept the view that the President may dismiss, as caprice may suggest, any inferior officer whom he has appointed with consent of the Senate, notwithstanding a positive inhibition by Congress. In the last analysis, that view has no substantial support, unless it be the polemic opinions expressed by Mr. Madison (and eight others) during the debate of 1789, when he was discussing questions relating to a 'superior officer' to be appointed for an indefinite term. Notwithstanding his justly exalted reputation as one of the creators and early expounder of the Constitution, sentiments expressed under such circumstances ought not now to outweigh the conclusion which Congress affirmed by deliberate action while he was leader in the House and has consistently maintained down to the present year, the opinion of this court solemnly announced through the great Chief Justice more than a century ago, and the canons of construction approved over and over again.\n Judgment should go for the appellant. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n In 1833 Mr. Justice Story, after discussing in sections 1537-1543 his Commentaries on the Constitution the much debated question concerning the President's power of removal, said in section 1544:\n'If there has been any aberration from the true constitutional exposition of the power of removal (which the reader must decide for himself), it will be difficult, and perhaps impracticable, after forty years' experience, to recall the practice to the correct theory. But, at all events, it will be a consolation to those who love the Union, and honor a devotion to the patriotic discharge of duty, that in regard to 'inferior officers' (which appellation probably includes ninety-nine out of a hundred of the lucrative offices in the government), the remedy for any permanent abuse is still within the power of Congress, by the simple expedient of requiring the consent of the Senate to removals in such cases.'\n\n Postmasters are inferior officer. Congress might have vested their appointment in the head of the department. \n1\n The Act of July 12, 1876, cc. 176, 179,  6, 19 Stat. 78, 80 (Comp. St.  7190), re-enacted earlier legislation,2 provided that:\n'Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law.'\n\n That statute has been in force un- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 241]\n\u00a0\n modified for half a century. Throughout the period, it has governed a large majority of all civil officers to which appointments are made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. \n3\n May the President, having acted under the statute in so far as it creates the office and authorizes the appointment, ignore, while the Senate is in session, the provision which prescribes the condition under which a removal may take place?\n It is this narrow question, and this only. which we are required to decide. We need not consider what power the President, being Commander-in- Chief, has over officers in the Army and the Navy. We need not determine whether the President, acting alone, may remove high political officers. We need not even determine whether, acting alone, he may remove inferior civil officers when the Senate is not in session. It was in session when the President purported to remove Myers, and for a long time thereafter. All questions of statutory construction have been eliminated by the language of the act. It is settled that, in the absence of a provision expressly providing for the consent of the Senate to a removal, the clause fixing the tenure will be construed as a limitation, not as a grant, and that, under such legislation, the President, acting alone, has the power of removal. Parsons v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 324\n, 17 S. Ct. 880; Burnap v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 512, 515\n, 40 S. Ct. 374. But, in defining the tenure, this statute used words of grant. Congress clearly intended to preclude a removal without the consent of the Senate.\n Other questions have been eliminated by the facts found, by earlier decisions of this court, and by the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 242]\n\u00a0\n nature of the claim made. It is settled that where the statute creating an office provides for the consent of the Senate to both appointment and removal, a removal by the President will be deemed to have been so made, if consent is given to the appointment of a successor. Wallace v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 541\n, 42 S. Ct. 221. But, in the case at bar, no successor was appointed until after the expiration of Myers' term. It is settled that if Congress had, under clause 2 of section 2, art. 2, vested the appointment in the Postmaster General, it could have limited his power of removal by requiring consent of the Senate. United States v. Perkins, \n116 \nU.S. 483\n, 6 S. Ct. 449. It is not questioned here that the President, acting alone, has the constitutional power to suspend an officer in the executive branch of the government. But Myers was not suspended. It is clear that Congress could have conferred upon postmasters the right to receive the salary for the full term unless sooner removed with the consent of the Senate. Compare Embry v. United States, \n100 U.S. 680\n, 685. It is not claimed by the appellant that the Senate has the constitutional right to share in the responsibility for the removal, merely because it shared, under the act of Congress, in the responsibility for the appointment. Thus the question involved in the action taken by Congress after the great debate of 1789 is not before us. The sole question is whether, in respect to inferior offices, Congress may impose upon the Senate both responsibilities, as it may deny to it participation in the exercise of either function.\n In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 167, it was assumed, as the basis of decision, that the President, acting alone, is powerless to remove an inferior civil officer appointed for a fixed term with the consent of the Senate; and that case was long regarded as so deciding. \n4\n In no \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 243]\n\u00a0\n case, has this court determined that the President's power of removal is beyond control, limitation, or regulation by Congress. nor has any lower federal court ever so decided. \n5\n This is true of the power as it affects officers in the Army or the Navy and the high political officers like heads of departments, as well as of the power in respect to inferior statutory offices in the executive branch. Continuously, for the last 58 years, laws comprehensive in character, enacted from time to time with the approval of the President, have made removal from the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 244]\n\u00a0\n great majority of the inferior presidential offices dependent upon the consent of the Senate. Throughout that period these laws have been continuously applied. We are requested to disregard the authority of Marbury v. Madison and to overturn this long-established constitutional practice.\n The contention that Congress is powerless to make consent of the Senate a condition of removal by the President from an executive office rests mainly upon the clause in section 1 of article 2 which declares that 'the executive Power shall be vested in a President.' The argument is that appointment and removal of officials are executive prerogatives; that the grant to the President of 'the executive power' confers upon him, as inherent in the office, the power to exercise these two functions without restriction by Congress, except in so far as the power to restrict his exercise of then is expressly conferred \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 245]\n\u00a0\n upon Congress by the Constitution; that in respect to appointment certain restrictions of the executive power are so provided for; but that in respect to removal there is no express grant to Congress of any power to limit the President's prerogative. The simple answer to the argument is this: The ability to remove a subordinate executive officer, being an essential of effective government, will, in the absence of express constitutional provision to the contrary, be deemed to have been vested in some person or body. Compare Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259. But it is not a power inherent in a chief executive. The President's power of removal from statutory civil inferior offices, like the power of appointment to them, comes immediately from Congress. It is true that the exercise of the power of removal is said to be an executive act, and that when the Senate grants or withholds consent to a removal by the President, it participates in an executive act. \n6\n But the Constitution has confessedly granted to Congress the legislative power to create offices, and to prescribe the tenure thereof; and it has not in terms denied to Congress the power to control removals. To prescribe the tenure involves prescribing the conditions under which incumbency shall cease. For the possibility of removal is a condition or qualification of the tenure. \n7\n When Congress provides that the incumbent \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 246]\n\u00a0\n shall hold the office for four years unless sooner removed with the consent of the Senate, it prescribes the term of the tenure.\n It is also argued that the clauses in article 2,  3, of the Constitution, which declare that the President 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States' imply a grant to the President of the alleged uncontrollable power of removal. I do not find in either clause anything which supports this claim. The provision that the President 'shall Commission all the Officers of the United States' clearly bears no such implication. Nor can it be spelled out of the direction that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' There is no express grant to the President of incidental powers resembling those conferred upon Congress by clause 18 of article 1,  8. A power implied on the ground that it is inherent in the executive, must, according to established principles \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 247]\n\u00a0\n of constitutional construction, be limited to 'the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.' Compare Marshall v. Gordon, \n243 \nU.S. 521, 541\n, 37 S. Ct. 448, L. R. A. 1917F, 279, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 371; Michaelson v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 42, 66\n, 45 S. Ct. 18, 35 A. L. R. 451. The end to which the President's efforts are to be directed is not the most efficient civil service conceivable, but the faithful execution of the laws consistent with the provisions therefor made by Congress. A power essential to protection against pressing dangers incident to disloyalty in the civil service may well be deemed inherent in the executive office. But that need, and also insubordination and neglect of duty, are adequately provided against by implying in the President the constitutional power of suspension. 8 Such provisional executive power is comparable to the provisional judicial power of granting a restraining order without notice to the defendant and opportunity to be heard. Power to remove, as well as to suspend, a high political officer, might conceivably be deemed indispensable to democratic government and, hence, inherent in the President. But power to remove an inferior administrative officer appointed for a fixed term cannot conceivably be deemed an essential of government.\n To imply a grant to the President of the uncontrollable power of removal from statutory inferior executive offices involves an unnecessary and indefensible limitation upon the constitutional power of Congress to fix the tenure of the inferior statutory offices. That such a limitation cannot be justified on the ground of necessity is demonstrated by the practice of our governments, state and national. In none of the original 13 states did the chief executive \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 248]\n\u00a0\n possess such power at the time of the adoption of the federal Constitution. In none of the 48 states has such power been conferred at any time since by a state Constitution,9 with a single possible exception. \n10\n In a few states the Legislature has granted to the Governor, or other \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 249]\n\u00a0\n appointing power, the absolute power of removal. \n11\n The legislative practice of most states reveals a decided tendency to limit, rather than to extend, the Governor's power of removal. \n12\n The practice of the federal government will be set forth in detail. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 250]\n\u00a0\n Over removal from inferior civil offices, Congress has, from the foundation of our government, exercised continuously some measure of control by legislation. The instances of such laws are many. Some of the statutes were directory in character. Usually, they were mandatory. Some of them, comprehensive in scope, have endured for generations. During the first 40 years of our government, there was no occasion to curb removals. 13 Then, the power of Congress was exerted to insure removals. Thus, the Act of September 2, 1789, c. 12, 1 Stat. 65, 67, establishing the Treasury Department, provided by section 8 (Comp. St.  377), that if any person appointed to any office by that act should be convicted of offending against any of its provisions, he shall 'upon conviction be removed from office.' The Act of March 3, 1791, c. 18,  1, 1 Stat. 215 (Comp. St.  378), extended the provision to every clerk employed in the depart- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 251]\n\u00a0\n ment. The Act of May 8, 1792, c. 37,  12, 1 Stat. 279, 281, extended if further to the Commissioner of the Revenue and the Commissioners of Loans, presidential appointments. The first Tenure of Office Act, May 15, 1820, c. 102, 3 Stat. 582, introduced the 4-year term, which was designed to insure removal under certain conditions. \n14\n The Act of January 31, 1823, c. 9,  3, 3 Stat. 723, directed that officers receiving public money and failing to account quarterly shall be dismissed by the President unless they shall account for such default to his satisfaction. The Act of July 2, 1836, c. 270,  26, 37, 5 Stat. 80, 86, 88, which first vested the appointment of postmasters in the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, directed that postmasters and others offending against certain prohibitions 'be forthwith dismissed from office,' and as to other offenses pro- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 252]\n\u00a0\n vided for such dismissal upon conviction by any court. The Act of July 17, 1854, c. 84,  6, 10 Stat. 305, 306 (Comp. St.  4482), which authorized the President to appoint registers and receivers, provided that 'on satisfactory proof that either of said officers, or any other officer, has charged or received fees or other rewards not authorized by law, he shall be forthwith removed from office.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n In the later period, which began after the spoils system had prevailed for a generation,16 the control of Congress over inferior offices was exerted to prevent removals. The removal clause here in question was first introduced by the Currency Act of February 25, 1863, c. 58,  1, 12 Stat. 665, which was approved by President Lincoln. That statute provided for the appointment of the Comp- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 253]\n\u00a0\n troller, and that he 'shall hold his office for the term of five years unless sooner removed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.' In 1867 this provision was inserted in the Tenure of Office Act of March 2, 1867, c. 154,  1, 3, 6, 14 Stat. 430, 431, which applied, in substance, to all presidential offices. It was passed over President Johnson's veto.17 In 1868, after the termination of the impeachment proceedings, the removal clause was inserted in the Wyoming Act of July 25, 1868, c. 235,  2, 3, 9, 10, 15 Stat. 178-181, which was approved by President Johnson.\n By Act of June 8, 1872, c. 335, 17 Stat. 283, a consolidation and revision of the postal laws was made. The removal clause was inserted in section 63 in the precise form in which it had first appeared in the Currency Act of 1863. From the act of 1872, it was carried as section 3830 into Revised Statutes, which consolidated the statutes in force December 1, 1873. The act of 1872 was amended by the Act of June 23, 1874, c. 456,  11, 18 Stat. 231, 234, so as to reduce the classes of postmasters besides New York City, from five to four. The removal clause was again inserted. When the specific classification of New York City in section 11 of the Act of 1874, was repealed by the Act of July 12, 1876, c. 179,  4, 19 Stat. 80, the removal clause was retained. thus, postmasters of the first three classes were made, independently of the Tenure of Office Act, subject to the removal clause. Each of these postal statutes was approved by President Grant. When President Cleveland secured, by Act of March 3, 1887, c. 353, 24 Stat. 500, the repeal of sections 1767 to 1772 of Revised Statutes (which had re-enacted as to all presidential offices the removal provision of the Tenure of Office Act), he made no attempt to apply the repeal to postmasters, although postmasters constituted then, as they have ever since, a large majority of all presidential appointees. The removal clause, which \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 254]\n\u00a0\n had become operative as to them by specific legislation, was continued in force. For more than half a century this postal law has stood unmodified. No President has recommended to Congress that it be repealed. A few proposals for repeal have been made by bills introduced in the House. Not one of them has been considered by it. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n It is significant that President Johnson, who vetoed in 1867 the Tenure of Office Act, which required the Senate's consent to the removal of high political officers, approved other acts containing the removal clause which related only to inferior officers. Thus, he had approved the Act \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 255]\n\u00a0\n of July 13, 1866, c. 176,  5, 14 Stat. 90, 92, which provided that 'no officer in the military or naval service shall in time of peace, be dismissed from service except upon and in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial to that effect, or in commutation thereof.' \n19\n And in 1868 he approved the Wyoming Act, which required such consent to the removal of inferior officers who had been appointed for fixed terms. It is significant also that the distinction between high political officers and inferior ones had been urged in the Senate in 1867 by Reverdy Johnson, when opposing the passage of the Tenure of Office Act. 20 It had apparently been recognized in 1789 at the time of the great debate in the First Congress, and by Chief Justice Marshall in 1807.21 \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 256]\n\u00a0\n It had been repeatedly pointed out in later years. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 257]\n\u00a0\n The administrative action of President Johnson under the Tenure of Office Act indicates likewise a recognition of this distinction bwtween inferior and high political offices. The procedure prescribed in section 2 required of the President a report to the Senate of the reasons for a suspension and also made its consent essential to a removal. In respect to inferior officers this course appears to have been scrupulously observed by the President in every case. This is true for the period before the institution of the impeachment proceedings23 as well as for the later period. \n24\n On the other hand, in the case of a high political officer, Secretary of War Stanton, President Johnson declined on serveral grounds to follow the procedure prescribed by the act. 16 Ex. Journ. 95. The requirement that the President should report reasons for suspension to the Senate was not retained by the amended Tenure of Office Act of April 5, 1869, c. 10, 16 Stat. 6; the other provisions, however, were substantially reenacted, and affirmative evidence of compliance by succeeding Presidents with its requirements as to inferior officers is recorded between 1869 and the repeal of the act in 1887. Suspensions and not removals were made during recess. \n25\n In those rare instances where removals \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 258]\n\u00a0\n were sought by means other than the appointment of a 'successor,' Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur requested the Senate's consent to the removals. 26 Where the Senate failed to confirm the nomination of a successor, the former incumbent retained office until either the expiry of his commission or the confirmation of a successor. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 259]\n\u00a0\n From the foundation of the government to the enactment of the Tenure of Office Act, during the period while it remained in force, and from its repeal to this time, the administrative practice in respect to all offices has, so far as appears, been consistent with the existence in Congress of power to make removals subject to the consent of the Senate. \n28\n The practice during the earlier period was described by Webster in addressing the Senate on February 16, 1835:\n'If one man be Secretary of State, and another be appointed, the first goes out by the mere force of the ap- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 260]\n\u00a0\n pointment of the other, without any previous act of removal whatever. And this is the practice of the government, and has been, from the first. In all the removals which have been made, they have generally been effected simply by making other appointments. I cannot find a case to the contrary. There is no such thing as any distinct official act of removal. I have looked into the practice, and caused inquiries to be made in the departments, and I do not learn that any such proceeding is known as an entry or record of the removal of an officer from office; and the President could only act, in such cases, by causing some proper record or entry to be made, as proof of the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 261]\n\u00a0\n fact of removal. I am aware that there have been some cases in which notice has been sent to persons in office that their services are, or will be, after a given day, dispensed with. These are usually cases in which the object is, not to inform the incumbent that he is removed, but to tell him that a successor either is, or by a day named will be, appointed.' 4 Works (8th Ed.) 189.\n\n In 1877, President Hayes, in a communication to the Senate in response to a resolution requesting information as to whether removals had been made prior to the appointment of successors, said:\n'In reply I would respectfully inform the Senate that in the instances referred to removals had not been made at the time the nominations were sent to the Senate. The form used for such nominations was one found to have been in existence and heretofore used in some of the departments, and was intended to inform the Senate that if the nomination proposed were approved it would operate to remove an incumbent whose name was indicated. R. B. Hayes.' 7 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 481.\n\n Between 1877 and 1899, the latest date to which the records of the Senate are available for examination, the practice has, with few exceptions, been substantially the same. \n29\n It is, doubtless, because of this practice, and the long-settled rule recently applied in Wallace v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 541, 545\n, 42 S. Ct. 221, that this court has not had occasion heretofore to pass upon the constitutionality of the removal clause. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 262]\n\u00a0\n The practice of Congress to control the exercise of the executive power of removal from inferior offices is evidenced by many statutes which restrict it in many ways besides the removal clause here in question, Each of these restrictive statutes became law with the approval of the President. Every President who has held office since 1861, except President Garfield, approved one or more of such statutes. Some of these statutes, prescribing a fixed term, provide that removal shall be made only for one of several specified causes. \n30\n Some provide a fixed term, subject generally to removal for cause. \n31\n Some pro- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 263]\n\u00a0\n vide for removal only after hearing. \n32\n Some provide a fixed term, subject to removal for reasons to be communicated by the President to the Senate. 33 Some impose the restriction in still other ways. Thus, the Act of August 24, 1912, c. 389,  6, 37 Stat. 539, 555 (Comp. St.  3287) which deals only with persons in the classified civil service, prohibits removal 'except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing,' and forbids removal for one cause which had theretofore been specifically prescribed by President Roosevelt and President Taft as a ground for dismissal. \n34\n The Budget \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 264]\n\u00a0\n Act of June 10, 1921, c. 18,  303, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (Comp. St.  400 4\/5 aa), provides a fixed term for the Comptroller General and the Assistant Comptroller General, and makes these officers removable only by impeachment or, by joint resolution of Congress, after hearing, for one of the causes specified. It should be noted that while President Wilson had, on June 4, 1920, vetoed an earlier Budget Act, which like this denied to the President any participation in the removal, he had approved the Mediation and Conciliation Act of July 15, 1913, and the Railroad Labor Board Act of February 28, 1920, which prohibited removals except for the causes therein specified.\n The assertion that the mere grant by the Constitution of executive power confers upon the President as a prerogative the unrestricted power of appointment and of removal from executive offices, except so far as otherwise expressly provided by the Constitution, is clearly inconsistent also with those statutes which restrict the exercise by the President of the power of nomination. There is not a word in the Constitution which in terms authorizes \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 265]\n\u00a0\n Congress to limit the President's freedom of choice in making nominations for executive offices. It is to appointment as distinguished from nomination that the Constitution imposes in terms the requirement of Senatorial consent. But a multitude of laws have been enacted which limit the President's power to make nominations, and which through the restrictions imposed, may prevent the selection of the person deemed by him best fitted. Such restriction upon the power to nominate has been exercised by Congress continuously since the foundation of the government. Every President has approved one or more of such acts. Every President has consistently observed them. This is true of those offices to which he makes appointments without the advice and consent of the Senate as well as of those for which its consent is required.\n Thus Congress has, from time to time, restricted the President's selection by the requirement of citizenship. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 52, 266]\n\u00a0\n It has limited the power of nomination by providing that the office may be held only by a resident of the United States;36 of a state;37 of a particular state;38 of a par- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 267]\n\u00a0\n ticular district;39 of a particular territory;40 of the District of Columbia; 41 of a particular foreign country. \n42\n It has limited the power of nomination further by prescribing specific professional attainments,43 or occupational \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 268]\n\u00a0\n experience. \n44\n It has, in other cases, prescribed the test of examinations. 45 It has imposed the requirement of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 269]\n\u00a0\n age;46 of sex;47 of races;48 of property;49 and of habitual temperance in the use of intoxicating liquors. \n50\n Congress \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 270]\n\u00a0\n has imposed like restrictions on the power of nomination by requiring political representation;51 or that the selec- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 271]\n\u00a0\n tion be made on a nonpartisan basis. \n52\n It has required, in some cases, that the representation be industrial;53 in \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 272]\n\u00a0\n others, that it be geographic. \n54\n It has at times required that the President's nominees be taken from, or include \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 273]\n\u00a0\n representatives from, particular branches or departments of the government. 55 By still other statutes, Congress \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 274]\n\u00a0\n has confined the President's selection to a small number of persons to be named by others. \n56\n\u00a0\n\n The significance of this mass of legislation restricting the power of nomination is heightened by the action which President Jackson and the Senate took when the right to impose such restrictions was, so far as appears, first mooted. On February 3, 1831, the Senate resolved that it was inexpedient to appoint a citizen of one state to an office created or made vacant in another state of which such citizen was not a resident, unless an apparent necessity for such appointment existed. 4 Ex. Journ. 150. \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 275]\n\u00a0\n Several nominations having been rejected by the Senate in accordance with the terms of this resolution, President Jackson communicated his protest to the Senate, on March 2, 1833, saying that he regarded 'that resolution, in effect, as an unconstitutional restraint upon the authority of the President in relation to appointments to office.' Thereupon the Senate rescinded the resolution of 1831. 4 Ex. Journ. 331. But that Congress had the power was not questioned. The practice of prescribing by statute that nominations to an inferior presidential office shall be limited to residents of a particular state or district has prevailed, without interruption, for three-quarters of a century. \n57\n\u00a0\n\n The practical disadvantage to the public service of denying to the President the uncontrollable power of removal from inferior civil offices would seem to have been exaggerated. Upon the service, the immediate effect would ordinarily be substantially the same, whether the President, acting alone, has or has not the power of removal. For he can, at any time, exercise his constitutional right to suspend an officer and designate some other person to act temporarily in his stead; and he cannot while the Senate is in session, appoint a successor without its consent. Compare Embry v. United States, \n100 U.S. 680\n. On the other hand, to the individual in the public service, and to the maintenance of its morale, the existence of a power in Congress to impose upon the Senate the duty to share in the responsibility for a removal is of paramount importance. The Senate's consideration of \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 276]\n\u00a0\n a proposed removal may be necessary to protect reputation and emoluments of office from arbitrary executive action. Equivalent protection is afforded to other inferior officers whom Congress has placed in the classified civil service and which it authorizes the heads of departments to appoint and to remove without the consent of the Senate. Act Aug. 24, 1912, c. 389,  6, 37 Stat. 539, 555. The existence of some such provision is a common incident of free governments. In the United States, where executive responsibility is not safeguarded by the practice of parliamentary interpellation, such means of protection to persons appointed to office by the President with the consent of the Senate is of special value.\n Until the Civil Service Law, January 16, 1883, c. 27, 22 Stat. 403 ( Comp. St.  3271-3278, 3280-3282, 10288-10292) was enacted, the requirement of consent of the Senate to removal and appointment was the only means of curbing the abuses of the spoils system. The contest over making Cabinet officers subject to the provisions of the Tenure of Office Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 430) has obscured the significance of that measure as an instrument designed to prevent abuses in the civil service. \n58\n But the importance of the measure as a means of civil service reform was urged at the time of its passage;59 again \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 277]\n\u00a0\n when its repeal was resisted in 186960 and in 1872;61 and finally in 1887 ( 24 Stat. 500), when its repeal was effected. \n62\n That act \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 278]\n\u00a0\n was one of two far-reaching measures introduced in 1866 aimed at the abuses of executive patronage. The Jenckes bill was to establish the classified service. The tenure of office bill was to control removals from presidential offices. Like the Jenckes bill, it applied, when introduced, only to inferior offices. The Jenckes bill, reported by the House committee on June 13, 1866, was finally tabled in the House on February 6, 1867.63 The tenure of office bill was reported out in the House on December 5, 1866, \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 279]\n\u00a0\n was amended by the conference committee so as to apply to Cabinet officers, and having passed both Houses, was sent to the President on February 20, 1867, and passed over his veto on March 2, 1867.\n The fact that the removal clause had been inserted in the currency bill of 1863 (12 Stat. 665) shows that it did not originate in the contest of Congress with President Johnson, as has been sometimes stated. Thirty years before that, it had been recommended by Mr. Justice Story as a remedial measure, after the wholesale removals of the first Jackson administration. The Post Office Department was then the chief field for plunder. Vacancles had been created in order that the spoils of office might be distributed among political supporters. Fear of removal had been instilled in continuing officeholders to prevent opposition or lukewarmness in support. Gross inefficiency and hardship had resulted. Several remedies were proposed. One of the remedies urged was to require the President to report to the Senate the reasons for each removal. 64 The second was to take the power of appointing postmasters from the Postmaster General and to confer it upon the President, subject to the consent of the Senate. \n65\n A third \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 280]\n\u00a0\n proposal was to require consent of the Senate also to removals. \n66\n Experience since has taught that none of these remedies is effective. Then, however, Congress adopted the second measure. The evil continued; and the struggle against the spoils system was renewed. The \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 281]\n\u00a0\n other crude remedies which had been rejected-accountability of the President to the Senate67 and the requirement of its consent to removals 68-were again considered; \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 282]\n\u00a0\n and both continued to be urged upon Congress, even after the fourth and the more promising remedy-inquiry into fitness for office and competitive examinations-had been proposed. For a generation, the reformers failed to secure the adoption of any further measure.\n The first substantial victory of the civil service reform movement, though a brief one, was the insertion of the removal clause in the Currency Bill of 1863.69 The next forward step was taken by the Consular and Diplomatic Appropriation Act June 20, 1864, c. 136,  2, 13 Stat. 137, 139, 140, also approved by President Lincoln, which contained a provision that consular clerks should be appointed by the President after examination, and that 'no clerk so appointed shall be removed from office except for cause stated in writing, which shall be submitted to Congress at the session first following such removal.' \n70\n It was in the next Congress that the removal clause was applied generally by the Tenure of Office Act. The long delay in adopting legislation to curb removals was not because Congress accepted the doctrine that the Consti- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 283]\n\u00a0\n tution had vested in the President uncontrollable power over removal. It was because the spoils system held sway.\n The historical data submitted present a legislative practice, established by concurrent affirmative action of Congress and the President, to make consent of the Senate a condition of removal from statutory inferior, civil, executive offices to which the appointment is made for a fixed term by the President with such consent. They show that the practice has existed, without interruption, continuously for the last 58 years; that throughout this period, it has governed a great majority of all such offices; that the legislation applying the removal clause specifically to the office of postmaster was enacted more than half a century ago; and that recently the practice has, with the President's approval, been extended to several newly created offices. The data show further that the insertion of the removal clause in acts creating inferior civil offices with fixed tenures is part of the broader legislative practice, which has prevailed since the formation of our government, to restrict or regulate in many ways both removal from and nomination to such offices. A persistent legislative practice which involves a delimitation of the respective powers of Congress and the President, and which has been so established and maintained, should be deemed tantamount to judicial construction, in the absence of any decision by any court to the contrary. United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 469\n, 35 S. Ct. 309.\n The persuasive effect of this legislative practice is strengthened by the fact that no instance has been found, even in the earlier period of our history, of concurrent affirmative action of Congress and the President which is inconsistent with the legislative practice of the last 58 years to impose the removal clause. Nor has any instance been found of action by Congress which in- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 284]\n\u00a0\n volves recognition in any other way of the alleged uncontrollable executive power to remove an inferior civil officer. The action taken by Congress in 1789 after the great debate does not present such an instance. The vote then taken did not involve a decision that the President had uncontrollable power. It did not involve a decision of the question whether Congress could confer upon the Senate the right, and impose upon it the duty, to participate in removals. It involved merely the decision that the Senate does not, in the absence of legislative grant thereof, have the right to share in the removal of an officer appointed with its consent, and that the President has, in the absence of restrictive legislation, the constitutional power of removal without such consent. Moreover, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized, the debate and the decision related to a high political office, not to inferior ones. \n71\n\u00a0\n\n Nor does the debate show that the majority of those then in Congress thought that the President had the uncontrollable power of removal. The Senators divided equally in their votes. As to their individual views we lack knowledge; for the debate was secret. \n72\n In the House only 24 of the 54 members voting took part in the debate. Of the 24, only 6 appear to have held the opinion that the President possessed the uncontrollable power of removal. The clause which involved a denial of the claim that the Senate had the constitutional right to participate in removals was adopted, so far as appears, by aid of the votes of others who believed it expedient for \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 285]\n\u00a0\n Congress to confer the power of removal upon the President alone. \n73\n This is indicated both by Madison's appeal for support74 and by the action taken on Benson's motions. 75 \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 286]\n\u00a0\n It is true that several Presidents have asserted that the Constitution conferred a power of removal uncontrollable \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 287]\n\u00a0\n by Congress. \n76\n But of the many statutes enacted since the foundation of our government which in express terms controlled the power of removal, either by the clause here in question or otherwise, only two were met with a veto: The Tenure of Office Act of 1867, which related to high political officers among others, and the Budget Act of 1921 (Comp. St.  400 1\/2 et seq.), which denied to the President any participation in the removal of the Comptroller and Assistant Comptroller. One was passed over the President's voto; the other was approved by the succeeding President. It is true also that several Presidents have at times insisted that for the exercise of their power they were not accountable to the Senate. \n77\n But even these Presidents \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 288]\n\u00a0\n have at other times complied with requests that the ground of removal of inferior officers be stated. \n78\n Many of the Presidents have furnished the desired information \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 289]\n\u00a0\n without questioning the right to request it. \n79\n And neither the Senate nor the House has at any time receded \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 290]\n\u00a0\n from the claim that Congress has power both to control by legislation removal from inferior offices and to require the President to report to it the reasons for removals made therefrom. \n80\n Moreover, no instance has been found in which a President refused to comply with an act of Congress requiring that the reasons for removal of an inferior officer be given. On the contrary, President Cleveland who refused to accede to the request of the Senate that he state the reasons for the removal of Duskin had, in the case of Burchard, complied, without protest or reserva- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 291]\n\u00a0\n tion, with the requirement of the Act of February 12, 1873, c. 131,  1, 17 Stat. 424 (now Rev. Stat.  343 (Comp. St.  507)) that the reasons for the removal of the Director of the Mint be communicated by him to the Senate. 25 Ex. Journ. 242. A construction given to the Constitution by the concurrent affirmative action of Congress and the President continued throughout a long period without interruption should be followed despite the isolated utterances, made in the heat of political controversies not involving the question here in issue by individual Presidents supported only by the advice of the Attorney General. \n81\n\u00a0\n\n The separation of the powers of government did not make each branch completely autonomous. It left each in some measure, dependent upon the others, as it left to each power to exercise, in some respects, functions in their nature executive, legislative and judicial. Obviously the President cannot secure full execution of the \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 292]\n\u00a0\n laws, if Congress denies to him adequate means of doing so. Full execution may be defeated because Congress declines to create offices indispensable for that purpose; or because Congress, having created the office, declines to make the indispensable appropriation; or because Congress, having both created the office and made the appropriation, prevents, by restrictions which it imposes, the appointment of officials who in quality and character are indispensable to the efficient execution of the law. If, in any such way, adequate means are denied to the President, the fault will lie with Congress. The President performs his full constitutional duty, if, with the means and instruments provided by Congress and within the limitations prescribed by it, he uses his best endeavors to secure the faithful execution of the laws enacted. Compare Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 613, 626.\n Checks and balances were established in order that this should be 'a government of laws and not of men.' As White said in the House in 1789, an uncontrollable power of removal in the Chief Executive 'is a doctrine not to be learned in American governments.' Such power had been denied in colonial charters,82 and even under pro- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 293]\n\u00a0\n prietary grants83 and royal commissions. 84 It had been denied in the thirteen states before the framing of the federal Constitution. \n85\n The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy. In order to prevent arbitrary executive action, the Constitution provided in terms that presidential appointments be made with the consent of the Senate, unless Congress should otherwise provide; and this clause was construed by Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist, No. 77, as requiring like consent to removals. \n86\n Limiting further execu- \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 294]\n\u00a0\n tive prerogatives customary in monarchies, the Constitution empowered Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers, 'as we think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.' Nothing in support of the claim of uncontrollable power can be inferred from the silence of the convention of 1787 on the subject of removal. For the outstanding fact remains that every specific proposal to confer such uncontrollable power upon the President was rejected. \n87\n In America, as in England, the conviction prevailed then that the people must look to representative \n\n[272 U.S. 52, 295]\n\u00a0\n assemblies for the protection of their liberties. And protection of the individual, even if he be an official, from the arbitrary or capricious exercise of power was then believed to be an essential of free government.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n My Brothers McREYNOLDS and BRANDEIS have discussed the question before us with exhaustive research and I say a few words merely to emphasize my agreement with their conclusion.\n The arguments drawn from the executive power of the President, and from his duty to appoint officers of the United States (when Congress does not vest the appointment elsewhere), to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and to commission all officers of the United States, seem to me spiders' webs inadequate to control the dominant facts.\n We have to deal with an office that owes its existence to Congress and that Congress may abolish to-morrow. Its duration and the pay attached to it while it lasts depend on Congress alone. Congress alone confers on the President the power to appoint to it and at any time may transfer the power to other hands. With such power over its own creation, I have no more trouble in believing that Congress has power to prescribe a term of life for it free from any interference than I have in accepting the undoubted power of Congress to decree its end. I have equally little trouble in accepting its power to prolong the tenure of an incumbent until Congress or the Senate shall have assented to his removal. The duty of the President to see that the laws be executed is a duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to achieve more than Congress sees fit to leave within his power. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Maclay shows the vote 10 to 10. Journal of William Maclay, 116. John Adams' Diary shows 9 to 9. 3 C. F. Adams, Works of John Adams, 412. Ellsworth's name appears in Maclay's list as voting against striking out, but not in that of Adams-evidently an inadvertence. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The suggestion that different considerations may possibly apply to nonconstitutional judicial officers I regard as a mere smoke screen. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Different phases of this general subject have been elaborately discussed in Congress. See discussions on the following meaures: Bill to establish a Department of Foreign Affairs, 1789, Annals 1st Cong.; bill to amend the judicial system of the United States, 1802, Annals 7th Cong., 1st Sess.; bill to amend Act of May 15, 1820, fixing tenure of certain offices, 1835, Debates 23d Cong., 2d Sess.; bill to regulate the tenure of certain civil offices, 1866-67, Globe, 39th Cong., 3d Sess.; Johnson impeachment trial, 1868, Globe Supplement, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This debate began May 19 in the committee of the whole on Mr. Madison's motion: 'That it is the opinion of this committee, that there shall be established an executive department, to be denominated the Department of Foreign Affairs, at the head of which there shall be an officer, to be called the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and to be removable by the President.'\n The words, 'who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,' were objected to as superfluous, since 'the Constitution had expressly given the power of appointment in the words there used,' and Mr. Madison agreed to their elimination.\n Doubts were then expressed whether the officer could be removed by the President. The suggestion was that this could only be done by impeachment. Mr. Madison opposed the suggestion, and said: 'I think the inference would not arise from a fair construction of the words of that instrument. ... I think it absolutely necessary that the President should have the power of removing from office. ... On the constitutionality of the declaration I have no manner of doubt.'\n Thereupon Mr. Vining, of Delaware, declared: 'There were no negative words in the Constitution to preclude the President from the exercise of this power; but there was a strong presumption that he was invested with it, because it was declared, that all executive \n power should be vested in him, except in cases where it is otherwise qualified; as, for example, he could not fully exercise his executive power in making treaties, unless with the advice and consent of the Senate- the same in appointing to office.'\n Mr. Bland and Mr. Jackson further insisted that removal could be effected only through impeachment, and Mr. Madison replied: He 'did not conceive it was a proper construction of the Constitution to say that there was no other mode of removing from office than that by impeachment; he believed this, as applied to the judges, might be the case; but he could never imagine it extended in the manner which gentlemen contended for. He believed they would not assert, that any part of the Constitution declared that the only way to remove should be by impeachment; the contrary might be inferred, because Congress may establish offices by law; therefore, most certainly, it is in the discretion of the legislature to say upon what terms the office shall be held, either during good behavior or during pleasure.'\n Later in the day Mr. Madison discussed various objections offered and said: 'I cannot but believe, if gentlemen weigh well these considerations, they will think it safe and expedient to adopt the clause.' Others spoke briefly, and then, as the record recites, 'The question was now taken, and carried by a considerable majority, in favor of declaring the power of removal to be in the President.' The resolution was reported; the Hosue concurred; and a committee (including Mr. Madison) was appointed to prepare and bring in a bill.\n On June 2 the committee reported a bill, providing for a Secretary, 'to be removable from office by the President of the United States,' which was read and referred to the committee of the whole. It was taken up for consideration June 16, and the discussion continued during five days. Members expressed radically different views. Among other things Mr. Madison said:\n'I have, since the subject was last before the House, examined the Constitution with attention, and I acknowledge that it does not perfectly correspond with the ideas I entertained of it from the first \n\n glance. ... By a strict examination of the Constitution, on what appears to be its true principles, and considering the great departments of the government in the relation they have to each other, I have my doubts whether we are not absolutely tied down to the construction declared in the bill. ...\n'If this is the true construction of this instrument, the clause in the bill is nothing more than explanatory of the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore not liable to any particular objection on that account. If the Constitution is silent, and it is a power the Legislature have a right to confer, it will appear to the world, if we strike out the clause, as if we doubted the propriety of vesting it in the President of the United States. I therefore think it best to retain it in the bill.'\n\n June 19, 'the call for the question being now very general, it was put, Shall the words 'to be removable by the President,' be struck out? It was determined in the negative; being yeas 20, nays 34.' There were further remarks, and 'the committee then rose and reported the bill ... to the House.'\n Discussion of the disputed provision was renewed on June 22. Mr. Benson moved to amend the bill 'so as to imply the power of removal to be in the President,' by providing for a chief clerk, who should have custody of the records, etc., 'whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States, or in any other case of vacancy.' He 'hoped his amendment would succeed in reconciling both sides of the House to the decision and quieting the minds of gentlemen.' If successful, he would move to strike out the words, 'to be removable by the President.' After a prolonged discussion the amendment prevailed, the much-challenged clause was striken out, and the ambiguous one suggested by Mr. Benson was inserted. June 24 the bill, thus amended, finally passed.\n Five members, once delegates to the Constitutional Convention, took part in the debate. Mr. Madison, Mr. Baldwin, and Mr. Clymer expressed similar views; Mr. Sherman and Mr. Gerry were emphatically of the contrary opinion. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Officers with commissions is the State Department who were removed: Collectors of customs, 17; collectors and inspectors, 25; surveyors of ports, 4; surveyors and inspectors, 9; supervisors, 4; naval officers, 4; marshals, 28; district attorneys, 23; principal assessors, 3; collectors of direct taxes, 4; consuls, 49; ministers abroad, 5; charges des affaires, 2; secretaries of legation, 3; Secretary of State, 1; Secretary of War. 1; Secretary of the Treasury, 1; Secretary of the Navy, 1; Attorney General, 1; Commissioner of Loans, 1; receivers of public moneys, 2; registers of land offices, 2; agent of the Creek Nation, 1; Register of the Treasury, 1; Comptroller of the Treasury, 1; auditors, 2; Treasurer of the United States, 1; Treasurer of the Mint, 1; Commissioner of Public Buildings, 1; Recorder of Land Titles, 1; judge of territory, 1; secretaries of territories, 2; commissioner for the adjustment of private land claims, 1; surveyors general, 2; surveyors of the public lands, 3.\n Officers in the Treasury Department who were removed: Surveyor and inspector, 1; naval officer, 1; appraisers, 2; collectors, 2; surveyors, 2; receivers of public moneys, 12; registers of the land office, 4. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Mr. Lee (theretofore Attorney General of the United States), counsel for Marbury, distinctly claimed that the latter was appointed to serve for a definite term independent of the President's will, and upon that predicate rested the legal right which he insisted should be enforced by mandamus. Unless that right existed there was no occasion-no propriety, indeed-for considering the court's power to declare an act of Congress invalid. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] At this time the power of the court to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional was being vigorously denied. The Supreme Court, by Chas. Warren, vol. 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Prior to the Act of July 2, 1836, c. 270,  33, 5 Stat. 80, 87, all postmasters were appointed by the Postmaster General. Fourth class postmasters are still appointed by him. See Acts of May 8, 1794, c. 23,  3, 1 Stat. 354, 357 (Comp. St.  567); April 30, 1810, c. 37,  1, 5, 28, 40, 42, 2 Stat. 592; March 3, 1825, c. 64,  1, 4 Stat. 102; March 3, 1863, c. 71,  1, 12 Stat. 701; July 1, 1864, c. 197,  1, 13 Stat. 335. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The removal provision was introduced specifically into the postal legislation by Act Jan. 8, 1872, c. 335,  63, 17 Stat. 283, 292, and re- enacted, in substance, in Act June 23, 1874, c. 456,  11, 18 Stat. 231, 234 in the Revised Statutes,  3830, and the Act of 1876 (see Comp.

During the year ending June 30, 1923, the number of presidential appointees was 16,148. The number of postmasters of the first, second and third classes was 14,261.

Ed. 693) it was said by this court of the decision in Marbury v. Madison: 'On the contrary, the Chief Justice asserted the authority of Cougress to fix the term of a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia beyond the power of the President to lessen it by removal. ...' The same significance is attached to the decision in 1 Kent, Commentaries ( 12th Ed.) 311, note 1.\n Reverdy Johnson, who had been Attorney General, said of Marbury v. Madison, while addressing the Senate on Jan. 15, 1867, in opposition to the tenure of office bill: 'But, says my brother and friend from Oregon, that case decided that the President had no right to remove. Surely that is an entire misapprehension. The Constitution gives to the President the authority to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to certain high offices, but gives to Congress the power to vest the appointment and to give the removal of inferior officers to anybody they think proper; and these justices of the peace were inferior and not high officers within the meaning of those two terms in the Constitution. Congress, therefore, by providing that such an officer should hold his commission for four years, removed the officer from the power of removal of the President, as they could have taken from him the power to appoint. Nobody doubts that if they were inferior officers, as \n they were, Congress might have given the power to appoint those officers to the people of the district by election, or to any individual that they might think proper, or to any tribunal other than the executive department of the government. They had a right, although they thought proper to give it to the President himself, to provide that it should endure for four years against any such power of removal.' That is all the case decided upon that question.' Cong. Globe, 39th Cong. 2d Sess., 461. See note 71, infra. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] In United States v. Avery, Deady, 204, Fed. Cas. No. 14,481, the statute creating the office did not prescribe a fixed tenure and there was no provision for removal only by and with the consent of the Senate. In United States v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, 305, Mr. Justice McLean, dissenting, denied that the President's power of removal was uncontrollable. In Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 238 (10 L. Ed. 138), it was stated that, where the power of appointment is vested in the head of a department, 'the President has certainly no power to remove.'\n State courts have uniformly held that, in the absence of express provision in their constitution to the contrary, legislative restrictions upon the power of removal by the Governor, or other appointing power, are valid as applied to persons holding statutory officers.

Rep. 128. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 'If a law were to pass, declaring that district attorneys, or collectors of customs, should hold their offices four years, unless removed on conviction for misbehavior, no one could doubt its constitutional validity, because the Legislature is naturally competent to prescribe the tenure of office. And is a reasonable check on the power of removal any thing more than a qualification of the tenure of office?' Webster, Feb. 16, 1835, 4 Works (8th Ed.) 197.\n'It is the legislative authority which creates the office, defines its duties, and may prescribe its duration. I speak, of course, of offices not created by the Constitution, but the law. The office, coming into existence by the will of Congress, the same will may provide how, and in what manner, the office and the officer shall both cease to exist. It may direct the conditions on which he shall hold the office, and when and how he shall be dismissed.' Clay, Feb. 18, 1835, 11 Cong. Deb. 518.\n\n'Congress shall have power to make all laws, not only to carry into effect the powers expressly delegated to itself, but those delegated to the government, or any department of office thereof, and of course comprehends the power to pass laws necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers expressly granted to the executive department. If follows, of course, to whatever express grant of power to the executive the power of dismissal may be supposed to attach, whether to that of seeing the law faithfully executed, or to the still more comprehensive grant, as contended for by some, vesting executive powers in the President, the mere fact that it is a power appurtenant to another power, and necessary to carry it into effect, transfers it, by the provisions of the Constitution cited, from the executive to Congress, and places it under the control of Congress, to be regulated in the manner which it may judge best.' Calhoun, Feb. 20, 1835, 11 Cong. Deb. 553. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Debate of 1789 (June 17), Stone: 'All the difficulties and embarrassments that have been mentioned can be removed by giving to the President the power of suspension during the recess of the Senate, and I think that an attention to the Constitution will lead us to decide that this is the only proper power to be vested in the President of the United States.' 1 Ann.

Control by the Legislature of his power of removal from inferior offices had early judicial sanction. Commonwealth v. Sutherland, 3 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 145. Maryland. The Governor seems to have had such power under the Constitution of 1776, but it was later taken away.

Q. Adams-7, being a total of 156. Fish, Removal of Officials, 1899 Am. Hist. Ass'n Rep. 67. Compare Sen. Rep. No. 576, 47th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 2006, p. iv. 'It was the intention of the founders of our government that administrative officers should hold office during good behavior. ... Madison, the expounder of the Constitution, said that the wanton removal of a meritorious officer was an impeachable offense. It was the established usage without question or variation during the first 40 years of our government to permit executive officers, except members of the Cabinet, to hold office during good behavior, and this practice was only changed by the 4-year tenure act of 1820, which was passed at the instance of an appointing officer for the purpose of using this power to secure his nomination as a presidential candidate.' Report of U. S. Civil Service Commission for 1896, pp. 28, 29. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Fish, Civil Service and Patronage, 66-70. Madison, in commenting upon the Four-Year Limitation Act of 1820 to President Monroe, recognized the necessary identity of a power to prescribe qualifications of tenure and a power to remove from office. 'Is not the law vacating periodically the described offices an encroachment on the Constitutional attributes of the Executive? ... If a law can displace an officer at every period of four years, it can do so at the end of every year, or at every session of the Senate; and the tenure will then be the pleasure of the Senate as much as of the President, and not of the President alone.' 3 Letters and Writings, 200. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The provisions of the acts of 1789, 1791, 1792, 1836, and 1854 were re-enacted in the Revised Statutes and are still in force. Rev. Stats .  243, 244, 2242 (Comp. St.  377, 378, 4482), and section 3947, as amended (Comp. St.  10392). Mandatory directions of dismissal for specified offenses are also contained in Act March 2, 1867, c. 172,  3, 14 Stat. 489, 492, reenacted in Rev. Stats.  1546 (Comp.

From the operation of the latter act executive officers and employees appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate are significantly excepted. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Removals made from 1829 to 1869 of presidential appointees, exclusive of military officers, were as follows: Jackson-180, Van Buren-43, Harrison and Tyler-389, Polk-228, Taylor-491, Fillmore-73, Pierce-771, Buchanan-253, Lincoln-1,400, Johnson-726, being a total of 4,554. Fish, Removal of Officials, 1899 Am. Hist. Ass'n Rep. 67. The great increase in removals under President Jackson included offices besides those to which appointments were made by the President and Senate, the accepted estimate during the first year of his administration being 2,000. 2 Story, Constitution,  1543; House Rep. No. 47, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 1352, p. 8. Of these 491 were postmasters. 1 Am. States Papers, Post Office, 242. The increase in the number of such removals is testified to by the incomplete reports of the following years. The Post Office Department consistently suffered most. See Lucy Salmond, History of the Appointing Power, 1 Am. Hist. Ass'n Papers, No. 5, pp. 67-86. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] It was amended by Act of April 5, 1869, c. 10, 16 Stat. 6. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] On February 8, 1887, while the bill for the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act was pending, the committee on post offices and post roads reported a bill, H. R. 11108, for reclassifying postmasters into three classes, and provided (section 1) that: 'Postmasters of the First and second classes shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of four years, subject to the provisions of law respecting their removal or suspension, and the filling or vacancies occurring when the Senate shall not be in session. ... Postmasters of the third class shall be appointed and commissioned by the Postmaster General, and hold their offices during his pleasure.' 18 Cong. Rec. 1498. The bill was not considered by Congress.\n On January 5, 1892, Sherman Hoar introduced a bill (H. R. 196) to provide that all postmasters should hold office during good behavior. 23 Cong. Rec. 130. Section 1 contained the following proviso: 'Provided, however, that the President may at any time remove or suspend a postmaster for cause stated.' On December 22, 1895, De Forest introduced H. R. 8328, 27 Cong. Rec. 576. Section 2 provided: 'That postmasters of all classes now in office of hereafter to be appointed shall be appointed to hold their officers for good behavior; Provided that the President may at any time remove or suspend a postmaster of the first, second or third class for cause, communicated in writing to the Senate at the next subsequent session of Congress after such removal, and that the Postmaster General may at any time remove or suspend a postmaster of the fourth class for cause, communicated in the letter of removal.' Section 3 forbade appointment, removal, or suspension for political reasons. On January 28, 1896, Gillett introduced the identical bill (H. R. 8328). 28 Cong. Rec. 1061. None of these three bills was considered even by a committee. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This provision was re-enacted by Rev. Stats.  1229 (Comp. St.  2001). Comp. Sen Rep. Apr. 4, 1864, No. 42, 38th Cong. 1st Sess., Ser. No. 1178. In Blake v. United States, \n103 U.S. 227\n, 237 (26 L. Ed. 462) this provision was interpreted as not denying 'the power of the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to displace them by the appointment of others in their places.' The Act of June 4, 1920, c. 227, art. 118, 41 Stat. 759, 811 (Comp. St.  2308a) provides:\n'Art. 118. Officers; Separation from Service.-No officer shall be discharged or dismissed from the service except by order of the President or by sentence of a general court-martial; and in time of peace no officer shall be dismissed except in pursuance of the sentence of a general court- martial or in mitigation thereof; but the President may at any time drop from the rolls of the Army any officer who has been absent from duty three months without leave or who has been absent in confinement in a prison or penitentiary for three months after final conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction.' \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] See note 4, p. 67, supra. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] See Lawrence, June 17, 1 Ann. Cong. 483, 484; Smith, june 17, 1 Ann. Cong. 508, 509; Madison, June 18, 1 Ann. Cong. 547, 548. A few days subsequent to the debate on the removal provision in the act establishing a Department of Foreign Affairs, Madison, although he believed that the power to prescribe the tenure of office and the power of removal were in essence the same, moved to amend the act establishing a Treasury Department by providing that the Comptroller should hold office for a limited period of years. To the objection that such a provision was not within the power of Congress he replied: 'When I was up before ... I endeavored to show that the nature of this office differed from the others upon which the House had decided, and, consequently, that a modification might take place, without interfering with the former distinction; so that it cannot be said we depart from the spirit of the Constitution.' 1 Ann. Cong. 614. Stone, in support of Madison, added: 'As the Comptroller was an inferior officer, his appointment might be vested in the President by the Legislature; but, according to the determination which had already taken place, it did not necessarily follow that he should have the power of dismissal; and before it was given, its propriety ought to be apparent.' 1 Ann. Cong. 613. See note 71, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] In 1830, Senator Barton, in defense of his resolutions denying an uncontrollable presidential power of removal, said: 'It is no question whether a President may remove, at his own will and pleasure, his Secretary of State. That was the very question before Congress in the great debate of 1789. ... Nobody would wish to force a disagreeable member of the Cabinet on the President. ... But the class of officers now before the Senate, and their predecessors, attempted to be removed by the President, were not under consideration in the debate of 1789. This is a class of public officers-or officers of the law-whose term, tenure, and duties of office are fixed and prescribed by the laws of the land, and not by the executive will, as in the other class. ... The power is now boldly asserted on this floor by the majority, for the first time since the foundation of the Republic, of removing this class of federal officers by the President at discretion, without the slightest restraint by the Senate.' 6 Cong. Deb. 458, 459. The same distinction was taken in 1835, by Senators Wright and White, in the debate on the Executive Patronage Bill. 11 Cong. Deb. 480, 487.\n On June 15, 1844, the Senate committee on retrenchment, dealing with the evils of executive patronage, said: 'It will be sufficient for the committee to show that Congress may regulate, by law, as well the power to appoint inferior officers as to remove them. ... The committee will not protract the argument. It is not known to them that the power of Congress to regulate the appointment and removal of inferior officers has been questioned. It is very certain that the authority of the President to control the departments in the exercise of the power has not at any time been recognized by law.' Sen. Dec. No. 399, 28th Cong. 1st Sess., Ser. No. 437, pp. 29, 30. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] In six instances President Johnson in separate messages communicated his reasons for suspension. 16 Ex. Journ. 3, 109, 110, 122, 133. In two further instances misconduct was given as the ground for suspension. 16 Id. 1. \n[\nFootnote 24\n] Five cases of this nature are on record. 16 Ex. Journ. 411, 412. \n[\nFootnote 25\n] From President Grant's administration to the close of the first two years of President Cleveland's first administration, nominations of officials to succeed those who had been suspended during the recess follow one of two forms: 'I nominate A. B., who was designated during the recess of the Senate, to be ___, vice C. D., suspended,' or 'I nominate A. B. to be postmaster at ___ in place of C. D., suspended under the provisions of the seventeen hundred and sixty-eighth section of the Revised Statutes of the United States.' These forms are not used after March 3, 1887. The case of A. C. Botkin, marshal of Montana Territory, is illustrative of the fact that suspension and not removal could be effected during the recess. On January 28, 1885, President Arthur nominated E. A. Kreidler in place of A. C. Botkin to be removed. 24 Ex. Journ. 425. The Senate failed to act upon the nomination and on December 21, 1885, President Cleveland nominated R. S. Kelly, vice A. C. Botkin, suspended. For several months action upon the nomination was delayed and on April 28, 1886, the President sent the following message to the Senate: 'I nominated Robert S. Kelly, of Montana, to the Senate on the 21st day of December, 1885. ... in the place of A. C. Botkin, who was by me suspended under the provisions of section 1768 of the Revised Statutes. On the 12th day of April 1886, the term of office for which said A. C. Botkin was originally appointed expired; and I renew the nomination of Robert S. Kelly, of Montana ... in the place of the said A. C. Botkin, whose term of office has so expired as aforesaid.' 25 Ex. Journ. 441. These years of President Cleveland disclose 78 other cases of a similar nature. Id. 396-410, 426, 436, 441, 488, 490-494, 497, 501, 516, 539, 563, 714, 715. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] On Dec. 6, 1869, President Grant requested the consent of the Senate to the removal of certain Indian agents, to whose posts army officers had been assigned. 17 Ex. Journ. 289. On May 17, 1872, the Senate gave its consent to the removal of T. H. Bazin, appraiser of merchandise at Charleston, S. C. 18 Ex. Journ. 251. On Dec. 4, 1878, President Hayes requested the Senate's consent to the removal of A. M. Devereux, a third lieutenant in the revenue service. 21 Ex. Journ. 393. The Senate during that session took no action. To the three succeeding sessions of the Senate the same request was made without securing its consent. 22 Ex. Journ. 23, 108, 410. President Garfield likewise made the same request but failed to secure any action by the Senate. 23 Ex. Journ, 9, 29. On April 15, 1884, President Arthur recommended to the Senate the removal of F. N. Wicker as collector of customs at Key West. 24 Ex. Journ. 246. The Senate concurred in his removal without expressing an opinion upon the constitutional powers of the President and Senate upon the subject of removal. Id. 249. \n[\nFootnote 27\n] The instances are numerous and a few illustrations will suffice. On March 2, 1883, Paul Strobach was nominated as a marshal, vice M. C. Osborn, to be removed. 23 Ex. Journ. 711. The Senate took no action during that session and in the recess Osborn was suspended. Strobach was again nominated but was rejected at the next session of the Senate. Thereupon on May 8, 1884, J. H. Speed was nominated, 'vice Paul Strobach, temporarily appointed during the recess of the Senate.' 24 Ex. Journ. 265. Pending action upon the nomination President Arthur on May 14, 1884, again nominated J. H. Speed, 'vice M. C. Osborn, whose term has expired. This nomination is made to correct an error in the nomination of Joseph H. Speed to the above-named office, which was delivered to the Senate on the 8th instant, and which is hereby withdrawn.' 24 Ex. Journ. 267. The correction expressly recognizes that Osborn had never ceased to hold office. Compare 15 Op. A. G. 375. Again, on March 2, 1884, Windus was nominated as a postmaster, vice Lambert, 'whose removal for cause is hereby proposed.' 24 Ex. Journ. 220. The Senate rejected Windus, and on December 17, 1885, President Cleveland nominated Gildea, vice Lambert, 'whose commission expired May 13, 1885.' 25 Ex. Journ. 228. On January 6, 1885, Richardson was nominated as a postmaster, vice Corson, 'whose removal for cause is hereby proposed.' 24 Ex. Journ. 412. The Senate failed to act upon the nomination, and on April 1, 1885, Cleveland nominated Bonner to the post, vice Corson, 'whose removal for cause is hereby proposed.' 25 Ex. Journ. 45. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Since the enactment of the Tenure of Office Act various forms have been used to nominate officials to succeed those whose removal is thereby sought. Examination of their use over a period of 32 years indicates that no significance is to be attached to the use of any particular from. Thus the nomination is sometimes in the form A. B., vice C. D., 'removed'; sometimes it is 'to be removed'; sometimes, 'removed for cause'; sometimes, 'whose removal for cause is hereby proposed.'\n\"Whose Removal for Cause \"To be \"Removed is Hereby \"Removed.\" Removed.\" for Cause.\" Proposed.\" 1867-1869 (Johnson) 37 72 3 1869-1873 (Grant) 468 464 17 1873-1877 (Grant) 120 144 19 1877-1881 (Hayes) 8 102 10 42 1881 (Garfield) 1 14 19 1881-1885 (Arthur) 4 78 69 1885-1887 (Cleveland) 15 19 24 1887-1889 (Cleveland) 178 1 1889-1893 (Harrison) 1080 118 9 1893-1897 (Cleveland) 808 101 1897-1899 (McKinley) 813 26\n\n Postmasters will be found included within all these categories. 16-31 Ex. Journ., passim. The form 'who has been removed' was twice used by President Grant and once by President Harrison. On one occasion President Grant used the form 'whom I desire to remove,' and on six occasions President Hayes used the form 'to be thus removed.' The simple form 'removed,' which has been exclusively used for postmasters since 1887, does not imply that removal has already been accomplished. That form was used in the Parsons and Shurtleff Cases, where the notification of removal sent to the incumbent stated that the removal would take effect upon the qualification of a successor. 29 Ex.

Journ. 1328. \n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] Cases in this Court dealing with the removal of civil officers, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, illustrate the practice of securing their removal by the appointment of a successor. In recent years the formal notification of removal commonly reads: 'Sir: You are hereby removed from the office of -, to take effect upon the appointment and qualification of your successor.'

Ct. 535, declares that, by construction, every act which prescribes specific causes for removal requires that removal be not made for such cause without a hearing. In Reagan v. United States, \n182 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 21 S. Ct. 842, 845 (45 L. Ed. 1162) it was said: 'The inquiry is, therefore whether there were any causes of removal prescribed by law March 1, 1895, or at the time of the removal. If there were, then the rule would apply that where causes of removal are specified by constitution or statute, as also where the term of office is for a fixed period, notice and hearing are essential. If there were not, the appointing power could remove at pleasure or for such cause as it deemed sufficient.' State courts have held that statutes providing for removal 'for cause' require that the appointee be given notice and an opportunity to defend himself. State v. Frazier, 47 N. D. 314, 182 N.

The executive orders of November 26, 1909, and April 8, 1912, forbade communications to members of Congress save through heads of departments. Report of U. S. Civil Service Commission, for 1912, pp. 23, 24. Section 6 of the act of 1912 was intended to override these orders. See 48 Cong. Rec. 5634-5636. On February 19, 1886, the National Civil Service Reform League in a series of resolutions recommended that the reasons for removal be treated as 'part of the public record.' 5 Civ. Serv. Rec. 92. On August 9, 1890, Commissioner Roosevelt advocated such a restriction upon removals. 10 Civ. Serv. Rec. 26. A bill reported from the select committee of the House on civil service reform in 1891 contained such a provision. House Rep. No. 4038, 51 Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 2890. The Attorney General in 1913 ruled, against an earlier opinion of the Civil Service Commission, that presidential appointees were excluded from the terms of the Act of 1912. 30 Op. A. G. 181. The Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883, c. 27,  2, 22 Stat. 403, 404 (Comp. St.  3272) which was approved by President Arthur, had also provided that failure to subscribe to political funds should not be a ground of dismissal. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] Citizens of-\n (a) The United States: Act May 3, 1802, c. 53,  5, 2 Stat. 195, 196, mayor of the District of Columbia; Act March 1, 1855, c. 133,  9, 10 Stat. 619, 623, ministers and their subordinates; Act Aug. 18, 1856, c. 127,  7, 11 Stat. 52, 55, consular pupils; Act June 20, 1864, c. 136,  2, 13 Stat. 137, 139 (Comp.

Marr as collector of internal revenue in Montana Territory, voted to reconsider the nomination, and ordered the nomination to be returned to the President 'with the notification that the nominee is ineligible on account of nonresidence in the district for which he is nominated.' 16 Ex. Journ. 372. President Johnson thereafter did not press Marr's nomination, but appointed A. J. Simmons to the office. 16 Ex. Journ. 429. \n\n[\nFootnote 58\n] The Tenure of Office Act as originally introduced excepted from its operation the Secretaries of State, Treasury, War, Navy, and Interior and the Postmaster General. Howe's attempts to strike out this exception, opposed by Senators Edmunds and Sherman, who were the principal sponsors of the act, failed twice in the Senate. A similar attempt in the House succeeded after first being rejected. The Senate again refused to concur in the House amendment. The amendment was, however, insisted upon by the House conferees. Finally the Senate by a margin of three votes agreed to accept the conference report. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 1518. \n[\nFootnote 59\n] The occasion of the passage of the Tenure of Office Act was the threatened attempt of President Johnson to interfere with the reconstruction policies of Congress through his control over patronage. An attempt by Schenck to secure its recommitment to the joint select committee on retrenchment was placed upon the ground that 'this whole subject was expressly referred to that committee' which had before it 'the bill introduced by the select committee on the civil service, at the head of which is the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Jenckes).' Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 23. Senator Edmunds, in resisting an attempt to expand the Tenure of Office Act to require the concurrence of the Senate in the appointment of all civil officers receiving more than $1,000 per annum, referred to the Jenckes bill as 'another branch of the subject which is under consideration elsewhere.' Id., 489. The committee in introducing the Tenure of Office Act, speaking through Senator Edmunds, 'recommended the adoption of this rule respecting the tenure of officers as a permanent and systematic and as they believe an appropriate regulation of the government for all administrations and for all time.' Id ., 382. \n\n[\nFootnote 60\n] The attempt on the part of the House to repeal the act in 1869 brought forth the opposition of those members of the Senate who were most active in the general movement for civil service reform. Jenckes had voted against the repeal in the House. Carl Schurz, who on December 20, 1869, introduced a bill for the competitive principle in the civil service, opposed the repeal, and urged that it be recast at the next session more effectually to effect the desired civil service reform. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., 155, 156. Trumbull, speaking for the Committee on Judiciary, said that 'they were unwilling after Congress had with such unanimity adopted this law within the last two years, and adopted it upon the principle that some law of this kind was proper to regulate the civil service, to recommend its absolute repeal ... they thought it better to recommend the suspension of the act until the next session of Congress, and then Congress can either repeal it or adopt some civil-service bill which in its judgment shall be thought to be for the best and permanent interests of the country.' Id., 88. The National Quarterly Review recognizing the essential unanimity of purpose between the Tenure of Office Act and other measures for civil service reform, said in 1867: 'The recent legislation on this subject by Congress was the first step in the right direction; Mr. Jenckes' bill is the second; but the one without the other is incomplete and unsafe.' House Rep. No. 47, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 1352, p. 93. \n[\nFootnote 61\n] The attempt to repeal the act was resisted in the House by Holman on the ground that since 'the general impression exists in the country that executive patronage should be in some form reduced rather than increased ... this fragment of the original law should remain in force.' Cong. Globe, 42nd Cong., 2d Sess., 3411. \n[\nFootnote 62\n] Edmunds, one of the few Senators still acquainted with the circumstances of its passage, thus protested against the passage of the repealing act: 'It is, as it looks to me, as if we were to turn our backs now and here upon the principle of civil service reform ... the passage of this bill would be the greatest practical step backward on the theory of the reformation of the civil service of the United States.' 18 Cong. Rec. 137. \n\n[\nFootnote 63\n] The Jenckes bill was introduced in the House on December 20, 1865. Summer had already on April 30, 1864, presented in the Senate a bill for a classified civil service. On June 13, 1866, the House committee on civil service reform reported out the Jenckes bill. It contained among other provisions a section requiring the proposed commission to prescribe, subject to the approval of the President, the misconduct or inefficiency which would be sufficient ground for removal and also the manner by which such charges were to be proved. This provision was retained in the succeeding bill sponsored by Jenckes in the House. The provision was expressly omitted from the Pendleton bill, which later became the Civil Service Act of 1883, in order not to endanger the passage of a measure for a classified civil service by impinging upon the controversial ground of removal. Senators Sherman and Brown attempted to secure legislation restricting removal by amendments to the Pendleton bill. 14 Cong. Rec. 210, 277, 364. In the first session of the Thirty-Ninth Congress no action was taken upon the Janckes bill; but the bill was reintroduced in the following session on January 29, 1867. An attempt on the part of Jenckes, after the initial passage of the Tenure of Office Act, to secure the passage of his bill resulted in the tabling of his scheme on February 6, 1867, by a vote of 72 to 66. \n\n[\nFootnote 64\n] This measure appears to have been first suggested on May 4, 1826, in a bill which accompanied the report presented by Benton from the select committee of the Senate appointed to investigate executive patronage when abuse of the power by President John Quincy Adams was apprehended. Sen. Doc. No. 88, 19th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 128. On March 23, 1830, Barton's resolution asserting the right to such information was reported. Sen. Doc. 103, 21st Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 193. On April 28, 1830, the proposal was renewed in a resolution introduced by Holmes. 6 Cong. Deb. 385. In 1835 it was embodied in the Executive Patronage Bill which passed the Senate on two successive occasions, but failed of action in the House. \n[\nFootnote 65\n] This measure appears to have been first suggested by President Monroe in his message of December 2, 1823. 41 Ann. Cong. 20. Its proposal for enactment into law was first suggested on May 4, 1826, by the report of the select committee appointed by the Senate on possible abuses of executive patronage. In 1832 the proposal was again brought forward by Vance of Ohio in the nature of an amendment to the postal legislation, 8 Cong. Deb. 1913. On March 7, 1834, Clay's resolutions, that advocated the concurrence of the Senate in removals, also included a proposal for the appointment of postmasters by the President with the concurrence of the Senate. On January 28, 1835, a report by the Senate committee on post offices called attention to the extended removals of postmasters. Sen. Doc. No. 86, 23d Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 268, p. 88. This report led to the introduction in 1835 and passage by the Senate of a bill reorganizing the Post Office, which contained the proposal under consideration. The House having failed to act upon the 1835 bill, it was reintroduced at the next session and passed by both Houses. Act July 2, 1836, c. 270, 5 Stat. 80. See, also, Sen. Doc. No. 362, 24th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 283. \n\n[\nFootnote 66\n] This measure appears to have been first proposed in Congress by Clay on March 7, 1834. 10 Cong. Deb. 834. In 1835, it was, in substance, embodied in an amendment proposed by him to the Executive Patronage Bill, which read: 'That in all instances of appointment to office by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the power of removal shall be exercised only in concurrence with the Senate; and, when the Senate is not in session, the President may suspend any such officer, communicating his reasons for the suspension during the first month of its succeeding session; and if the Senate concur with him, the officer shall be removed; but if it do not concur with him, the officer shall be restored to office.' 11 Cong. Deb. 523. In 1836 when a Senate committee of commerce investigated the removal of a gauger for political reasons, Levi Woodbury, then Secretary of the Treasury, suggested the assumption of Congressional control over removals, saying: 'The department deems it proper to add that ... a great relief would be experienced if ... the power of original appointment and removal in all these cases should be vested in Congress, if the exercise of it there is deemed more convenient and safe, and, at the same time, constitutional.' Sen. Doc. No. 430, 24th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 284, p. 30. \n\n[\nFootnote 67\n] On July 1, 1841, Benton again reintroduced a proposal of this nature. Cong. Globe, 27th Cong., 1st Sess., 63. On May 23, 1842, a select committee on retrenchment reported to the House on the necessity of diminishing and regulating executive patronage, saying 'they entertain no doubt of the power of Congress to prescribe, and of the propriety of prescribing, that, in all cases of removal by the President, he shall assign his reasons to the Senate at its next session.' House Rep. No. 741, 27th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 410, p. 5. See, also, Report of July 27, 1842, House Rep. No. 945, 27th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 410; 5 Ex. Journ. 401. On Jan. 3, 1844, after an attempt to impeach President Tyler for misusing the appointing power had failed, Thomasson in the House again sought to secure the adoption of such a measure. On December 24, 1849, after the Post Office Department under Taylor's administration had recorded 3,406 removals, Bradbury proposed a resolution requiring the President to give the number and reasons for removals made from the beginning of his term of office. Senator Mangum, in order to cut short debate on the resolution, contended that it was an unconstitutional invasion of executive powers and called for a test vote upon the resolution. The Senate divided 29 to 23 in upholding its right to demand reasons for removals. Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 1st Sess., 160. On January 4, 1850, the Senate adopted a resolution calling for a report upon the number and reasons for removals of deputy postmasters. Id. 100. \n[\nFootnote 68\n] The character that this movement to restrict the power of removal had assumed in consequence of the continuance of the spoils system is illustrated by the remarks of Bell in the Senate in 1850: 'To restrain this power by law I would urge as one of the greatest reforms of the age, so far as this government is concerned. ... Sir, I repeat that to restrain by law this unlimited, arbitrary, despotic power of the executive over the twenty or thirty thousand valuable public officers of the country- the tendency of which is to make them slaves of his will-is the greatest reform demanded by the true interest of the country, no matter who may at any time be the tenant of the White House.' Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 1st Sess., App. 1043. Restrictions were twice advocated in the official utterances of President Tyler. 4 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 50, 89. See, also, Report of June 15, 1844, by Sen. Com. on Retrenchment; Sen. Doc. 399, 28th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 437, p. 55; Resolution Dec. 17, 1844, by Grider in the House, Cong. Globe, 28th Cong., 2d Sess., 40. \n\n[\nFootnote 69\n] Act Feb. 25, 1863, c. 58,  1, 12 Stat. 665. \n[\nFootnote 70\n] By Act March 3, 1853, c. 97,  3, 10 Stat. 189, 211, clerks in the departments of the Treasury, War, Navy, Interior, and Post Office were to be classified and appointments to the various classes were to be made only after examination by a select board. This scheme was later abandoned after it became evident that the examinations prescribed were conducted arbitrarily and with no attempt to determine the fitness of candidates for positions. Fish, Civil Service and Patronage, 183. By Act Aug. 18, 1856, c. 127,  7, 11 Stat. 52, 55, the appointment of 25 consular pupils was authorized and examinations were to be conducted to determine the fitness of applicants for appointment. This provision was, however, stricken from the diplomatic and consular appropriation bill in the next session of Congress. The principle was not returned to again until Act June 20, 1864, c. 136,  2, 13 Stat. 137, 139. \n\n[\nFootnote 71\n] Chief Justice Marshall said of the proceedings of 1789: 'In organizing the departments of the executive, the question in what manner the high officers who filled them should be removable, came on to be discussed.' 5 Marshall, Life of Washington, 196. \n[\nFootnote 72\n] Of the ten Senators who had been members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, four voted against the bill. A fifth, Bassett, changed sides during the debate. Maclay, Sketches of Debate, 110. \n\n[\nFootnote 73\n] The six who held that the Constitution vested a sole power of removal in the President were Baldwin, 1 Ann. Cong. 557-560; Benson, Id. 505-507; Boudinot, Id. 526-532; Clymer, Id. 489; Madison, Id. 546; Vining, Id. 585. Madison, at first, considered it subject to congressional control. 1 Ann. Cong. 374, 375. Seven held that the power of removal was a subject for congressional determination and that it was either expedient or inexpedient to grant it to the President alone. Hartley, 1 Ann. Cong. 585; Lawrence, Id. 583; Lee, Id. 523-526; Sedgwick, Id. 582, 583; Sherman, Id. 491, 492; Sylvester, Id. 560-563; Tucker, Id. 584, 585. Five held that the power of removal was constitutionally vested in the President and Senate. Gerry, 1 Ann. Cong. 502; Livermore, Id. 477-479; Page, Id. 519, 520; Stone, Id. 567; White, Id. 517. Two held that impeachment was the exclusive method of removal. Jackson, 1 Ann. Cong. 374, 529-532; Smith, of South Carolina, 1 Ann. Cong. 457, 507-510. Three made desultory remarks-Goodhue 1 Ann. Cong. 378, 533, 534; Huntington, 1 Ann. Cong. 459; and Scott, 1 Ann. Cong. 532, 533-which do not admit of definitive classification. Ames was only certain that the Senate should not participate in removals, and did not differentiate between a power vested in the President by the Constitution and a power granted him by the Legislature. 1 Ann. Cong. 473- 477, 538-543. He inclined, however, towards Madison's construction. 1 Works of Fisher Ames, 56. During the earlier debate upon the resolutions for the creation of Executive Departments, Bland had contended that the Senate shared in the power of removal. 1 Ann. Cong. 373, 374. The conclusion that a majority of the members of the House did not hold the view that the Constitution vested the sole power of removal in the President was expressed by Senator Edmunds. 3 Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, 84. It had been expressed 20 years earlier by Lockwood, J., of the Supreme Court of Illinois, in a case involving a similar question and decided adversely to Madison's contention. Field v. People, 2 Scam. 79, 162-173. \n[\nFootnote 74\n] Madison's plea for support was addressed not only to those who conceived the power of removal to be vested in the President, but also to those who believed that Congress had power to grant the authority to the President and that under the circumstances it was expedient to confer such authority. After expressing his own views on the subject, he continued: 'If this is the true construction of this instrument, the clause in the bill is nothing more than explanatory of the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore not liable to any particular objection on that account. If the Constitution is silent, and it is a power the Legislature have a right to confer, it will appear to the world, if we strike out the clause, as if we doubted the propriety of vesting it in the President of the United States. I therefore think it best to retain it in the bill.' 1 Ann. Cong. 464. \n[\nFootnote 75\n] The initial vote of 34 to 20, defeating a motion to strike out the words 'to be removable by the President,' was indecisive, save as a determination that the Senate had no constitutional right to share in removals. Madison, June 22, 1789, 1 Ann. Cong. 578, 579. 'Indeed, the express grant of the power to the President rather implied a right in the Legislature to give or withhold it as their discretion.' 5 Marshall, Life of Washington, 200. Benson, therefore, proposed to remove this ambiguity by striking out the words 'to be removable by the President,' and inserting 'whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States,' thus implying the existence of the power in the President irrespective of legislative grant. The motions were successful and their adoption has been generally interpreted as a legislative declaration of Benson's purpose. Such interpretation, although oft repeated, is not warranted by the facts of record. The individual votes on these two motions are given. An examination of the votes of those whose opinions are also on record shows \n that Benson's first motion succeeded only as a result of coalition between those who accepted Madison's views and those who considered removal subject to congressional control but deemed it advisable to vest the power in the President. The vote on Benson's second motion to strike out the words 'to be removable by the President' brought forth a different alignment. The minority now comprised those who, though they believed the grant of power to be expedient, did not desire to imply the existence of a power in the President beyond legislative control; whereas the majority exhibits a combination of diverse views-those who held to Madison's construction, those who initially had sought to strike out the clause on the ground that the Senate should share in removals, and those who deemed it unwise to make any legislative declaration of the Constitution. Thus none of the three votes in the House revealed its sense upon the question whether the Constitution vested an uncontrollable power of removal in the President. On the contrary the votes on Benson's amendments reveal that the success of this endeavor was due to the strategy of dividing the opposition and not to unanimity of constitutional conceptions. \n\n[\nFootnote 76\n] President's Jackson, 3 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 133; Johnson, 6 Id. 492; Cleveland, 8 Id. 379; Wilson, 59 Cong. Rec. 8609. \n[\nFootnote 77\n] On February 2, 1835, the Senate adopted a resolution requesting the President to communicate to the Senate copies of the charges against Gideon Fitz, surveyor general, in that such information was necessary for its constitutional action upon the nomination of his successor. 4 Ex. Journ. 465. On February 10, 1835, President Jackson refused to comply with these alleged 'unconstitutional demands.' 4 Ex. Journ. 468. On January 25, 1886, the Senate adopted a resolution directing the Attorney General to transmit copies of documents on file in the Department of Justice relating to the management of the office of district attorney for the southern district of Alabama. J. D. Burnett had been nominated to the office in place of G. M. Duskin suspended. 25 Ex. Journ. 294. On February 1, 1886, a letter from the Attorney Generl was laid before the Senate refusing to accede with the request by direction of the President. On March 1, 1886, President Cleveland in a message to the Senate denied the constitutional right of the Senate to demand such information. 8 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 375. \n\n[\nFootnote 78\n] During March, 1830, prior to the Fitz episode, three resolutions to request the President to communicate grounds for the removal of inferior officials failed of adoption in the Senate. 4 Ex. Journ. 75, 76, 79. However, during April, 1830, in the case of nominations sent to the Senate for confirmation, resolutions requesting the President to communicate information relative to the character and qualifications of the appointees were adopted and complied with by President Jackson. 4 Id. 86, 88, 92.\n The instances of President Johnson's compliance with the second section of the Tenure of Office Act, requiring the communication of reasons for the suspension of inferior officials during the recess of the Senate, have been enumerated. See notes 23 and 24, supra. President Johnson also complied with a resolution adopted by the Senate on December 16, 1867, requestion him to furnish the petitions of Idaho citizens, filed with him, remonstrating against the removal of Governor Ballard. 16 Ex. Journ. 109, 121. Also, on April 5, 1867, his Attorney General complied with a Senate resolution calling for papers and other information relating to the charges against a judge of Idaho Territory, whose removal the President was seeking through the appointment of a successor. 15 Id. 630, 644. On February 18, 1867, his Postmaster General in compliance with a House resolution of December 6, 1866, transmitted the number and reasons for the removals of postmasters, appointed by the President, between July 28, 1866, and December 6, 1866. House Ex. Doc. No. 96, 39th Cong., 2d Sess ., Ser. No. 1293. His Secretary of the Interior also complied with a House resolution requesting information as to removals and reasons therefor in the department. House Ex. Dec. No. 113, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 1293.\n Prior to the date on which President Cleveland upheld his right to refuse the Senate information as to the conduct of a suspended official, his Secretary of the Treasury twice complied with requests of the Senate for such information. 25 Ex. Journ. 312, 317. These requests were couched in substantially the same form as that which was refused in the Duskin Case. Subsequent to that date, compliances with similar resolutions are recorded in four further cases, two by the Secretary of the Treasury, one by the Postmaster General and one by the Attorney General. 25 Ex. Journ. 362, 368, 480, 559. \n\n[\nFootnote 79\n] On March 2, 1847, President Polk complied with a Senate resolution requesting reasons and papers relating to the failure to send in Captain H. Holmes' name for promotion. 7 Ex. Journ. 227. On September 2, 1850, President Fillmore complied with a Senate resolution requesting the President to communicate correspondence relating to 'the alleged resignation' of Lieut. E. C. Anderson. 8 Ex. Journ. 226. Fillmore, in compliance with a Senate resolution of August 14, 1850, laid before the Senate a report of the Postmaster General communicating the charges on file against the deputy postmaster at Milwaukee. Id. 220. Nominations having been made for the collectorships of New York and Chicago, and the former incumbents suspended, Edmunds on November 26, 1877, proposed a resolution directing the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit all papers bearing upon the expediency of removing the collectors. On January 15, 1879, the Secretary of the Treasury communicated to the Senate an official report, and on January 31, 1879, President Hayes forwarded his reasons for the suspensions. 21 Ex. Journ. 140, 455, 497.\n Compliances with Senate resolutions directed to the heads of departments relative to the removal of presidential appointees are also on record. In response to a House resolution of February 13, 1843, requesting the charges against Roberts and Blythe, collectors, and the names of the persons who petitioned for their removal, the Secretary of the Treasury transmitted the material that he had in his control. House Doc. No. 158, 27th Cong., 3d. Sess., Ser. No. 422. On January 14, 1879, the Secretary of the Treasury complied with a Senate resolution requesting the charges on file against the Supervising Inspector General of Steamboats. 21 Ex. Journ. 454. On January 20, 1879, the Secretary of the Treasury complied with a Senate resolution calling for the papers showing why Lieutenant Devereux was discharged from the Revenue Marine Service. Id. 470. The Secretary of the Navy complied with a Senate resolution of February 25, 1880, asking why Edward Bellows was dropped from the roll of paymasters. Sen. Doc. No. 113, 46th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser. No. 1885.\n Presidents Van Buren and Tyler also complied with resolutions requesting the number of removals. Sen. Doc. No. 399, 28th Cong., 1st Sess ., Ser. No. 437, p. 351; House Doc. No. 48, 27th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 392.\n Senate resolutions, occasioned by the nomination of the successor in place of a former incumbent, requesting information as to the conduct or ability of the successor, have been complied with by Presidents Monroe on February 1, 1822 (3 Ex. Journ. 273); Jackson on April 12, and 15, 1830 (4 Ex. Journ. 88, 92), and on April 24, 1834 (4 Ex. Journ. 390); by Tyler on June 29, 1842 (6 Ex. Journ. 97); by Polk on June 23, 1848 (7 Ex. Journ. 435); by Fillmore on September 16, 1850 (8 Ex. Journ. 232); By Buchanan on March 2, 1858 (10 Ex. Journ. 237); by Grant on December 21, 1869 (17 Ex. Journ. 326); and by heads of departments under Polk on June 23, 1848 (7 Ex. Journ. 435); under Fillmore on September 25, 1850, and February 17, 1853 ( 8 Ex. Journ. 250, 9 Ex. Journ. 33); under Lincoln on January 22, 1862, and on February 23, 1865 (12 Ex. Journ. 95, 14 Ex. Journ. 135). The practice appears to have been suggested by President Washington. The Senate having rejected a nomination, President Washington on August 7, 1789, in nominating a successor, said: 'Permit me to submit to your consideration whether, on occasions when the propriety of nominations appear questionable to you, it would not be expedient to communicate that circumstance to me, and thereby avail yourselves of the information which led me to make them, and which I would with pleasure lay before you.' 1 Ex. Journ. 16. \n\n[\nFootnote 80\n] The Executive Patronage Bill, containing such a requirement, passed the Senate on February 21, 1835, and on February 3, 1836. A test vote on the Senate's right in 1850 is also on record. See note 67, supra. Following the protest of President Cleveland, resolutions condemnatory of the Attorney General's refusal 'under whatever influence' to communicate the information requested were favorably reported to the Senate, debated at length and passed. Among the members of the committee, advocating the adoption of the resolutions, were Hoar and Evarts, the two most energetic opponents of the Tenure of Office Act. Sen. Rep. No. 135, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 2358. The acts of 1864 and 1873, approved by Presidents Lincoln and Grant, embody such a requirement. See note 33, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 81\n] Attorneys General Legare, Clifford, and Crittenden seem to have been of the opinion that the President possessed an absolute power of removal. 4 Op. A. G. 1, 603; 5 Op. A. G. 288. Legare, however, having occasion to consider Story's contention that the power of removal might be restricted by legislation with respect to inferior officers, said that he was 'not prepared to dissent from any part of this sweeping proposition.' 4 Op. A. G. 165, 166. In 1818 Attorney General Wirt in holding that where an act of Congress gave the President power to appoint an officer, whose tenure of office was not defined, that officer was subject to removal by the President, said: 'Whenever Congress intend a more permanent tenure ( during good behavior, for example), they take care to express that intention clearly and explicitly. ...' 1 Op. A. G. 212, 213. Following the passage of the Tenure of Office Act the subject was considered by Attorney General Evarts, who disposed of the problem 'within the premises of the existing legislation.' 12 Op. A. G. 43, 449. In 1873 Attorney General Akerman refused to concede the President a power of removal in that under that Act he was limited to a power of suspension. 13 Op. A. G. 300. In 1877 Attorney General Devens concurred in the provisions of the Tenure of Office Act restoring a suspended officer to his office upon the failure of the Senate to act upon the confirmation of his successor. 15 Op. A. G. 375. \n\n[\nFootnote 82\n] The Connecticut Charter of 1662, vested the appointment of practically all officers in the assembly and provided that such officers were to be removable by the Governor, Assistants and Company for any misdemeanor of default. The Rhode Island Charter of 1663 contained the same provisions. The Massachusetts Charter of 1691 provided for the appointment of officers by and with the advice and consent of the council. Under Governors Phipps and Stoughton the council asserted its rights over appointments and dismissals, and in 1741 Shirley was prevented from going back to the earlier arbitrary practice of Governor Belcher. Spencer, Constitutional Conflict in Massachusetts, 28. The Georgia Charter of 1732 provided that the common council should have power to nominate and appoint and 'at their will and pleasure to displace, remove and put out such treasurer or treasurers, secretary or secretaries, and all such other officers, ministers and servants.' \n\n[\nFootnote 83\n] As early as 1724 Mrs. Hannah Penn, in her instructions to Sir William Keith, governor of Pennsylvania, protested against his dismissal of the Secretary without seeking the advice of his council. The practice of seeking such advice continued in later years. Shepherd, Proprietary Government in Pennsyivania, 321, 370. \n[\nFootnote 84\n] In the royal colonies there was a recognized tendency to guard against arbitrariness in removals by making the governor responsible to the home government instead of the local representative assembly. In New Hampshire the first and second Andros Commissions intrusted the power to the governor alone, but the Bellomont Commission of 1697, the Dudley Commission of 1702, the Shute Commission of 1716, the Burnet Commission of 1728, the Belcher Commission of 1729, the Wentworth Commission of 1741, and the John Wentworth Commission of 1766 were accompanied with instructions requiring either that removals be made only upon good and sufficient cause or upon cause signified to the home government in the 'fullest and most distinct manner.' In Virginia similar instructions accompanied the issuance of commissions to Governor Howard in 1683 and to Governor Dunmore in 1771. \n[\nFootnote 85\n] Smith of South Carolina, June 17, 1789, 1 Ann. Cong. 471; Gerry, June 17, 1789, 1 Ann. Cong. 504. See note 9, supra. \n[\nFootnote 86\n] Hamilton's opinion is significant in view of the fact that it was he who on June 5, 1787, suggested the association of the Senate with the President in appointments, as a compromise measure for dealing with the appointment of judges. 1 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, 128. The proposition that such appointments should be made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate was first brought forward by Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, 'in the mode prescribed by the Constitution of Massachusetts.' 2 Id. 41. Later this association of the President and the Senate was carried over generally to other appointments. The suggestion for the concurrence of the Senate in appointments of executive officials was advanced on May 29 by Pinckney in his 'draught of a foederal government' and by Hamilton in resolutions submitted by him on June 18, 1787. 1 Id. 292; 3 Id. 599. \n\n[\nFootnote 87\n] Rogers, Executive Power of Removal, 11, 39. On August 6, 1787, the Committee of Five reported the draft of the Constitution that in article 10,  2, provided for a single executive who 'shall appoint officers in all cases not otherwise provided for by this Constitution.' 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, 185. On August 20 propositions were submitted to the Committee of Five of the creation of a Council of State consisting of the Chief Justice, the Secretaries of domestic affairs, commerce and finance, foreign affairs, war, marine and state. All the Secretaries were to be appointed by the President and hold office during his pleasure. 2 Id. 335-337. That proposition was rejected, because 'it was judged that the Presidt. By persuading his council-to concur in his wrong measures, would acquire their protection. ...' 2 Id. 542. The criticism of Wilson, who had proposed the Council of State, and Mason of the Senate's participation in appointments was based upon this rejection. The lack of such a council was the 'fatal defect' from which 'has arisen the improper power of the Senate in the appointment of public officers.' 2 Id. 537. 639. \n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNAPIER v.

The main question, which is the same in the three cases, is one of statutory construction. It is whether the Boiler Inspection Act has occupied the field of regulating locomotive equipment used on a highway of interstate commerce, so as to preclude state legislation. Congress obviously has power to do so. Compare Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Washington, \n222 U.S. 370\n, 32  Ct. 160; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n250 \nU.S. 566\n, 40 S. Ct. 36; Oregon-Washington R. R. & Nav. Co. v. Washington, \n270 \nU.S. 87\n, 46 S. Ct. 279. \n No. 87\n involves a Georgia statute which prescribes an automatic door to the firebox. Act Aug. 18, 1924; Georgia Laws 1924, p. 173. That case is here on direct appeal from a final decree of the federal District Court, entered December 23, 1924, granting the injunction. 2 F.(2d) 891. Nos. 310 and 311 involve a Wisconsin statute which prescribes a cab curtain, Wisconsin Statutes,  1806a, as added by chapter 139, Laws of 1923. These cases are here on writs of error to the Supreme Court of that state, which affirmed a judgment denying the injunction. 188 Wis. 232, 205 N. W. 932. In Georgia, the details of the device were prescribed by the Legislature. In Wisconsin, the specifications were prescribed by an order of the state Railroad Commission. In each case, an interstate carrier sought to enjoin state officials from enforcing, in respect to locomotives used on its lines, a state law which prohibits use within the state of locomotives not equipped with the device prescribed. Some of the engines were being operated entirely within the state, some across the state line to and from adjoining states. It is conceded that the federal Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts apply to a lomotive used on a highway of interstate commerce, even if it is operated wholly within one state and is not engaged in hauling interstate freight or passengers. Southern Ry. Co. v. \n\n[272 U.S. 605, 608]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S. Ct. 2; Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S. Ct. 482.\n Prior to the passage of the Boiler Inspection Act, Congress had, by the Safety Appliance Act and several amendments, itself made requirements concerning the equipment of locomotives used in interstate commerce. It had required a power driving wheel brake, automatic couplers, grabirons or handholds, drawbars, safety ash pans, and sill steps. Act March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531; Act March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943; Act May 30, 1908, c. 225, 35 Stat. 476; Act April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat. 298 (Comp. St.  8605 et seq.). Congress first conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission power in respect to locomotive equipment in 1911. The original act applied only to the boiler. it is entitled:\n'An act to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads by compelling common carriers engaged in interstate commerce to equip their locomtives with safe and suitable boilers and appurtenances thereto.'\n\n The provisions of that act were extended in 1915 to 'include the entire locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances thereof.' In 1924, section 2 of the original act was amended to read as follows:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any carrier to use or permit to be used on its line any locomotive unless said locomotive, its boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which the same are put, that the same may be employed in the active service of such carrier without unnecessary peril to life or limb, and unless said locomotive, its boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof have been inspected from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this act and are able to withstand such test or tests as may be prescribed in the rules and regulations hereinafter provided for.'\n\n Other sections confer upon inspectors and the Commission power to prescribe requirements and establish rules \n\n[272 U.S. 605, 609]\n\u00a0\n to secure compliance with the provisions of section 2. From time to time since the passage of the original act, the Commission has required that locomotives used in interstate commerce be equipped with various devices. \n1\n But it has made no order requiring either a particular type of fire box door or a cab curtain. Nor has Congress legislated specifically in respect to either device.\n The Georgia act provides that the-\n'automatic door shall be so constructed and operated by steam, compressed air or electricity, as deemed best and most efficient by officer of such railroad. The device for operating such door shall be so constructed that it may be operated by the fireman of said engine by means of a push-button or other appliance located on the floor of the engine deck or floor of the tender ... to enable the fireman while firing such engine by pressure with his feet to operate such door for firing of such engine.'\n\n The automatic fire door conserves the health of the fireman by protecting him from exposures to extremes of heat and cold while performing his duties; conserves his eyesight by reducing the amount and extent of exposure to the glare of the fire; protects the safety of the employees in the event of an explosion in the fire box, and incidentally might affect the safety of the train, after such an explosion, in that employees, being safe, might be able to bring the train under control. The automatic fire door would also serve to protect travelers upon highways \n\n[272 U.S. 605, 610]\n\u00a0\n crossed by the railroad at grade. For the fireman is required to aid the engineer in keeping a lookout, and with use of the old type swinging door this is not continuously possible. The glare of the flame when the door is open practically blinds the fireman for a time.\n The purpose of the cab curtain is to protect engineers and firemen from the weather during the winter season. The Wisconsin act made it unlawful to use-\n'between the fifteenth day of November and the first day of April of each year any locomotive engine not equipped with suitable and approved cab curtains. Such curtains shall be so constructed as to efficiently enclose the openings between the engine cab and the water tank or coal tender attached to such locomotive engine. The windows of the cab shall be properly and closely fitted and all openings for levers or pipes and all other openings whatsoever through which cold or drafts may bring discomfort to the occupants, shall be efficiently protected in such manner as may be required and according to plans approved by the Railroad Commission.'\n\n Various types of cab curtains had been voluntrily installed by the carriers. But those installed by most of the carriers were such that snow entered the cabs in large quantities; that it saturated the clothing of engineers and firemen; and that the exposure caused great discomfort and danger of serious illness. The state Commission found that the plans for cab curtains submitted by the several carriers were, with one exception, not 'fuly suitable and effective for the protection of the health, comfort and welfare of the engine men,' and ordered particular requirements.\n Each device was prescribed by the state primarily to promote the health and comfort of engineers and firemen. Each state requirement may be assumed to be a proper exercise of its police power, unless the measure violates the commerce clause. It may be assumed, also, that there is no physical conflict between the devices required \n\n[272 U.S. 605, 611]\n\u00a0\n by the state and those specifically prescribed by Congress or the Interstate Commerce Commission,2 and that the interference with commerce resulting from the state legislation would be incidental only. The intention of Congress to exclude states from exerting their police power must be clearly manifested. Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 23 S. Ct. 92, Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S. Ct. 715. Does the legislation of Congress manifest the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment? Obviously it did not do so by the Safety Appliance Act, since its requirements are specific. It did not do so by the original Boiler Inspection Act, since its provisions were limited to the boiler. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280\n, 34 S. Ct. 829. But the power delegated to the Commission by the Boiler Inspection Act as amended is a general one. It extends to the design, the construction, and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.\n The requirements here in question are, in their nature, within the scope of the authority delegated to the Commission. An automatic firedoor and an effective cab curtain may promote safety. Keeping firemen and engineers in good health, like preventing excessive fatigue through limiting the hours of service, clearly does so, although indirectly, and it may be found that to promote theircomfort would likewise promote safety. It is argued that the authority delegated to the Commission does not extend to ordering the use or installation of equipment of any kind, Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521\n, 45 S. Ct. 169; and that Congress has definitely reserved that power to itself, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cin \n\n[272 U.S. 605, 612]\n\u00a0\n cinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Ry. Co., \n167 \nU.S. 479\n, 17 S. Ct. 869, 42 L Ed. 243; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280\n, 34 S. Ct. 829; United States v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 208\n, 37 S. Ct. 95. The question whether the Boiler Inspection Act confers upon the Interstate Commerce Commission power to specity the sort of equipment to be used on locomotives was left open in Vandalia R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n242 \nU.S. 255\n, 37 S. Ct. 93. We think that power was conferred. The duty of the Commission is not merely to inspect. It is also to prescribe the rules and regulations by which fitness for service shall be determined. Unless these rules and regulations are complied with, the engine is not 'in proper condition' for operation. Thus the Commission sets the standard. By setting the standard it imposes requirements. The power to require specific devices was exercised before the amendment of 1915, and has been extensively exercised since.\n The argument mainly urged by the states, in support of the claim that Congress has not occupied the entire field, is that the federal and the state laws are aimed at distinct and different evils; that the federal regulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in the operation of trains, whereas the state regulation endeavors to prevent sickness and disease due to excessive and unnecessary exposure; and that whether Congress had entered a field must be determined by the object sought through the legislation, rather than the physical elements affected by it. Did Congress intend that there might still be state regulation of locomotives, if the measure was directed primarily to the promotion of health and comfort, and affected safety, if at all, only incidentally?\n The federal and the state statutes are directed to the same subject- the equipment of locomotives. They operate upon the same object. It is suggested that the power delegated to the Commission has been exerted only in respect to minor changes or additions. But this, if true, \n\n[272 U.S. 605, 613]\n\u00a0\n is not of legal significance. It is also urged that, even if the Commission has power to prescribe an automatic firebox door and a cab curtain, it has not done so, and that it has made no other requirement inconsistent with the state legislation. This, also, if true, is without legal significance. The fact that the Commission has not seen fit to exercise its authority to the full extent conferred, has no bearing upon the construction of the act delegating the power. We hold that state legislation is precluded, because the Boiler Inspection Act, as we construe it, was intended to occupy the field. The broad scope of the authority conferred upon the Commission leads to that conclusion. Because the standard set by the Commission must prevail, requirements by the states are precluded, however commendable or however different their purpose. Compare Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. State, 16 Ala. App. 199, 76 So. 505; Whish v. Public Service Commission, 205 App. Div. 756, 200 N. Y. S. 282; Id., 240 N. Y. 677, 148 N. E. 755; Staten Island Rapid Transit Co. v. Public Service Commission, 16 F.(2d) 313.\n If the protection now afforded by the Commission's rules is deemed inadequate, application for relief must be made to it. The Commission's power is ample. Obviously, the rules to be prescribed for this purpose need not be uniform throughout the United States, or at all seasons, or for all classes of service.\n In No. 87, decree affirmed.\n In Nos. 310 and 311, judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Steam gauge (rule 28); safety valves (rule 34); water glass and gauge cocks (rule 37); shutoff and drain cocks (rule 38); shields on waterand lubricator drain cocks (rule 38); shields on water and lubricator water glasses (rule 42); particular types of ash pans (rule 105); 'clear vision' windows in cabs (rule 116); cylinder cocks (rule 119); sanding apparatus (rule 120); whistle (rule 121); safety bars or chains (rule 122b ); chafing irons (rule 123); headlights with designated intensity and devices (rules 129, 131); classification lamps (rule 130); cab lights ( rule 132); safety valve for oil supply pipe (rule 154). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is contended by the carriers that the order of the Wisconsin commission is in some minor respects, inconsistent with requirements prescribed, in other connections, by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

The charges in question were for shipments between March 1, 1920, and September 1, 1920, the six months following the termination of federal control of the railroads. The rates charged were those that were in effect on February 29, 1920. By section 208(a) of the Transportation Act 1920 (Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91; 41 Stat. 456, 464 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 d)), prior to September 1, 1920, no such rate could be reduced unless the reduction was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the six months \n\n[271 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n concerned being the period during which the United States guaranteed certain income to the railroads by section 209 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  10071 1\/4 dd). The Interstate Commerce Commission has not approved any reduction and therefore it is plain that the State Commission had no authority to intermeddle with the rates that it undertook to cut down. It is true that regulating rates and awarding reparation are different matters. But the prohibition in the statute covers either method of reducing the pay received by the roads. The language of the statute and the reasons for the enactment too clearly apply to intrastate as well as to interstate rates, to admit debate. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Boone, 46 S. Ct. 341, \n270 U.S. 466\n, March 22, 1926. Whether the rates were right, or were wrong as the State Court thinks, they could be changed only in one way.\n It may be that some of the questions before us would be proper matters for a writ of error, but as the rights asserted under the statute of the United States are more fully open upon a writ of certiorari we shall consider the case upon the last mentioned writ.\n The State Courts were of opinion that the plaintiffs in error had waived their rights by their failure to appeal from a decision on an earlier complaint to the State Commission in which that Commission held that a lower rate was reasonable and stated that upon presentation of a petition accompanied by the supporting data reparation would be awarded for freight charges paid in excess of the rates thus fixed. Whether the federal rights asserted were lost in this way is open to examination here. Creswill v. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, 32 S. Ct. 822, \n225 U.S. 246\n; Ward v. Love County, 40 S.

We do not undertake to review the decision of the Supreme Court as to state procedure, but if the railroads were too late to argue their case before that \n\n[271 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n Court they are not too late to argue it here. There was no order in the former hearing before the State Commission that the railroads could have brought before us. This is the first moment when they have had a chance to raise what we regard as a perfectly clear point, as it is the first moment when their rights have been infringed. There now is an order which is in the teeth of the statute. It would not be reasonable to hold that they are precluded from getting the protection that this Court owes them, by their having failed to go as far as they now learn that they might have gone in a previous state proceeding which did not infringe their rights and which could not be brought here.

(2d) 280. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this, except as to one item. 8 F. (2d) 851. Both parties are here by certiorari, and five questions require consideration. All involve the construction or application of the Revenue Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 172. Section 2 G(a) imposed an annual tax of one per centum upon the net income of 'every insurance company organized in the United States,' and (b) directed-\n'Such net income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of the income of such ... insurance company, received within the year from all sources, (first) all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties, including rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession of property; (second) all losses actually sustained within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation by use, wear and tear of property, if any ; ... and in case of insurance companies the net \n\n[271 U.S. 109, 115]\n\u00a0\n addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds and the sums other than dividends paid within the year on policy and annuity contracts: Provided, that ... life insurance companies shall not include as income in any year such portion of any actual premium received from any individual policyholder as shall have been paid back or credited to such individual policyholder, or treated as an abatement of premium of such individual policyholder, within such year. ...'\n\n\n 1. \nThe company, a New York corporation without capital stock, does business on the mutual level premium plan and issues both 'annual dividend' and 'deferred dividend' policies. Under this plan each policy holder pays annually in advance a fixed sum which, when added to like payments by others, probably will create a fund larger than necessary to meet all the maturing policies and estimated expenses. At the end of each year the actual insurance costs and expenses incurred are ascertained. The difference between their sum and the total of advance payments and other income, then becomes the 'overpayment' or surplus fund for immediate pro rata distribution among policy holders as dividends or for such future disposition as the contracts provide. An 'annual dividend' policy holder receives his proportionate part of this fund each year in cash or as a credit upon or abatement of his next premium. 'Deferred dividend,' or, as sometimes called, 'distribution,' policies provide-\n'That no dividend or surplus shall be allowed or paid upon this policy, unless the insured shall survive until completion of its distribution period, and unless this policy shall then be in force. That surplus or profits derived from such policies on the distribution policy plan as shall not be in force at the date of the completion of their respective distribution periods, shall be apportioned among such policies as shall complete the distribution periods.' \n\n[271 U.S. 109, 116]\n\u00a0\n Accordingly all overpayments by deferred dividend policy holders must await apportionment until the prescribed period ends, and no one of them will receive anything therefrom if his policy lapses or if he dies before that time. The whole of this fund goes to the survivors.\n\n Overpayments by deferred dividend policy holders for 1912 amounted to $ 8,189,918. The collector refused to deduct this sum from the total receipts, and demanded the prescribed tax of 1 per centum thereon. We think he acted properly. Both courts below so held.\n The applicable doctrine was much considered in Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Lederer, 40 S. Ct. 397, \n252 U.S. 523\n. We there pointed out the probable reason for the permitted noninclusion in the net income of a life insurance company of 'such portion of any actual premium received from any individual policy holder as shall have been paid back or credited to such individual policy holder, or treated as an abatement of premium of such individual policy holder, within such year.' Here it is insisted that within the meaning of the quoted provision each deferred dividend policy holder's overpayment was actually credited to him during the year; but we cannot accept this theory. The aggregate of all such payments was held for distribution among policy holders alive at the end of the period. The receipts for the year were not really diminished.\n\n 2. \nThe company owned many bonds, etc., payable at future dates, purchased at prices above their par values, and to amortize these premiums a fund was set up. It claimed that an addition to this fund should be deducted from gross receipts. The District Court thought the claim well founded, but the Circuit Court of Appeals took another view. Unless the addition amounted to a loss 'actually sustained within the year' no deduction could be made therefor. Obviously, no actual ascertainable loss had occurred. All of the securities might have been sold thereafter above cost. The result of the venture could not be known until they were either sold or paid off.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 109, 117]\n\u00a0\n 3. In 1910 the company introduced a clause into some policies by which it agreed to waive payments of premiums after proof of total and permanent disability. The estimated value on December 31, 1913, of future premiums so waived amounted to $16,629. It claimed this should be added to the reserve fund and deducted from gross income. Insurance companies may deduct 'the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds.'\n The pertinent portion of the agreed statement of facts follows:\n In 1910 the plaintiff introduced into some of its contracts of insurance a clause under which it agreed that upon receipt, before default in the payment of premium, of due proof that the insured had become totally and permanently disabled, the plaintiff would waive payment of any premium thereafter falling due. In taking its account at the end of the calendar year 1913, the plaintiff had then received due proof that the insured under a number of these policies were totally and permanently disabled in accordance with the terms of said contracts providing for the waiver of the payment of future premiums. The value at December 31, 1913, of the futute premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability was the sum of $16,629. The value at December 31, 1912, of the future premiums so waived was the sum of $5,637.\n In the calculation of the general reserve fund at the end of any calendar year, the company and the insurance department of the state of New York make the computation by deducting from the value of the contractual benefits under each policy the then value of all future premiums under the policy. The general reserve fund of the plaintiff stated in its annual statement is thus the reserve computed by deducting the value of all future premiums \n\n[271 U.S. 109, 118]\n\u00a0\n from the valuation of all policy obligations. But, under the policies on the lives of those who had become totally and permanently disabled and whose contracts provided for the waiver of the payment of future premiums, no future premiums will be received by the plaintiff, and therefore the net reserve reported for these policies in understated to the extent of the value of these future premiums.\n In the official blank for the plaintiff's annual statement to be used at December 31, 1913, there was an item of liabilities, No. 9-a, entitled 'Present Value of Future Premiums Waived on Account of Total and Permanent Disability,' and in the plaintiff's annual statement the sum reported under this item was $16,629 at December 31, 1913. The sum of $16,629 reported under item No. 9-a was not included in the plaintiff's general reserve. In the official blank for use at December 31, 1912, ther was no such item as No. 9-a, and the plaintiff included the value at December 31, 1912, of future premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability (viz. $5,637) as a part of the general reserve at that date.\n If said sum of $5,637 had not been included as a part of the general reserve at December 31, 1912, the net addition to the value of future premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability would have been the excess of $16,629 over $5,637. Since, however, owing to the change in the form of the official blank, the said $5,637 was deducted as a part of the plaintiff's general reserve in obtaining the net addition to the general reserve, the sum to use in obtaining the net addition to the value of future premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability in the sum of $16,629.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the deduction should have been allowed, but we think otherwise.\n The superintendent of insurance of New York required this item to be reported as a liability and did not treat \n\n[271 U.S. 109, 119]\n\u00a0\n it as part of the general reserve. Upon the agreed facts we cannot say that it was part of any reserve required by the laws of the New York. There is nothing to show how 'the value of the contractual benefits' under these policies was arrived at and, considering the evidence presented, we must accept the superintendent's conclusion. The company has not shown enough to establish its right to the exemption.\n\n 4. \nA number of policy holders died during the calendar year, but their deaths were not reported before it terminated. The superintendent of insurance required the company to set aside a special fund to meet these unreported losses, and it claimed that this was an addition to the reserve fund required by law. We think this claim was properly rejected by the commissioner, although the courts below held otherwise. McCoach v. Insurance Co. of North America, 37 S. Ct. 709, \n244 U.S. 585\n, and United States v. Boston Insurance Co., 46 S. Ct. 97, \n269 U.S. 197\n (November 23, 1925), pointed out that the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds,' does not necessarily include whatever a state official may so designate; that 'reserve funds' has a technical meaning. It is unnecessary now to amplify what was there said. The item under consideration represented a liability and not something reserved from premiums to meet policy obligations at maturity.\n\n 5. \nThe company also claimed deduction for additions to a fund set aside to provide for payment of annuities to former soliciting agents as provided by their contracts of employment. The Commissioner properly rejected this item, although both courts below held a different view. The agreed statement of facts shows:\n The plaintiff has a form of contract of employment with many of its soliciting agents under which, if such agents for a period of 20 years continuously devote their entire time, talents and energies in soliciting appli- \n\n[271 U.S. 109, 120]\n\u00a0\n cations for insurance, and if they shall for the 20 years accomplish certain prescribed minimum results, then at the end of twenty years of such service each such agent becomes entitled to an income for life payable monthly, the amount of the payment being based upon the results obtained by each such agent during the twenty year period. The laws of New York require the superintendent of insurance, in making a valuation of the obligations of the plaintiff to value annuities on the standard of McClintock's 'Table of Mortality among Annuitants,' with interest not exceeding four per centum per annum. Said superintendent of insurance after making an examination of the plaintiff and valuing its liabilities, required the plaintiff to carry, and it does carry, a fund to meet its said liabilities on said contracts with its soliciting agents, and this fund it increased during the year 1913. The net addition to said fund for said year was the sum of $160,641, which the plaintiff, in making its said return deducted from gross income under that clause of the law which authorizes a life insurance corporation to deduct the net addition required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds. But in amending said return the Commissioner refused to allow said deduction, and thereby made the plaintiff's net income for the year appear to be $ 160,641 more than it would have been if said deduction had been allowed, and he assessed and collected an additional tax on account thereof accordingly in the sum of $1,606.41, which forms a part of the tax in controversy in this suit.\n As pointed out above, the term 'reserve funds,' in the taxing act, has a technical meaning. The compensation which an insurance company agrees to pay soliciting agents has no relation to the reserve held to meet maturing policies, and when it sets aside a fund to provide payments to such agents this cannot be regarded as a reserve within intendment of the statute. \n\n[271 U.S. 109, 121]\n\u00a0\n The judgment below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nO'HARA v. LUCKENBACH S. S.

Carter, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, libelants below, quit the service of the steamship company and sought to recover their earned wages on the ground of a violation of section 2 of the Seamen's Act of March 4, 1915, c. 153, 38 Stat. 1164 (Comp. St.  8363b) copied in the margin. \n1\n Omitting the various provisions with which we \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n are not here concered, the pertinent requirement of that section is that:\n'The sailors shall, while at sea, be divided into at least two, and the firemen, oilers, and water tenders into at least three watches, which shall be kept on duty successively for the performance of ordinary work incident to the sailing and management of the vessel.'\n\n For a failure on the part of the master to comply with this, among other provisions of the section, the seamen are entitled to a discharge and to receive the wages earned. The failure complained of was that the sailors were not divided into watches of equal or approximately equal numbers, as, it was insisted, the statute contemplated.\n The company was the owner the steamship Lewis Luckenbach, a vessel of 14,400 tons burden, upon which libelants were hired as sailors for a voyage from New York to Pacific ports and return to some port north of Cape Hatteras on the Atlantic. Altogether, there was 13 sailors on board, 3 of whom, including libelants, were assigned as quartermasters. On the voyage and while at sea, these sailors were not equally divided into watches. Three watches were on duty, each consisting of one quartermaster and one able seaman, the remaining seven sailors being kept at day work only. The District Court dismissed the libel and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 1 F.(2d) 923. Both courts were of opinion that the primary object of the statutory provision was to fix hours of service so as to prevent overwork, not to prescribe the number of seamen on each watch. The District Court thought that this conception of the law was borne out by the consideration that, if one-half or one-third of the crew must be assigned to duty at night, a majority of them would have little or nothing to do. The Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to think that the purpose of Congress to provide for the safety of the ship was satisfied rather in the selection of qualified quartermasters and men for the lookout than in equality of the watches. With these views we are unable to agree. \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n The general purpose of the Seamen's Act is not only to safeguard the welfare of the seamen as workmen, but, as set forth in the title, also 'to promote safety at sea.' The act as a whole shows very clearly that, while hours of work and proper periods of rest were regarded as considerations of primary concern while the vessel is in a safe harbor, these considerations must yield, as they have always yielded, to the paramount necessity of safety while the ship is at sea; and, as indicating that the provision under review was not intended primarily as a regulation of working hours, it is significant that it does not apply to the entire crew, but requires a division into watches only of the sailors and the firemen, oilers, and water tenders. It is natural to suppose that, if the purpose of Congress was chiefly to regulate hours of work, something would have been said about the service, while at sea, of those employed in the steward's department as well. And not only is the division confined to those of the crew engaged in the mechanics of conducting the ship on her voyage, but the imperative requirement is that the watches into which they are divided 'shall be kept on duty successively'; that is to say, by turns, so that one watch must come on as another goes off. The evident purpose was to compel a division of the men for duty on deck and in the fireroom, and continuity of service, to the end that in those departments the ship should at all times be actively manned with equal efficiency.\n It probably is true, as said below, that to construe the statute as compelling numerical equality of the watches will result, so far as the sailors are concerned, in the performance of less work on deck at night. And it may be noted in that connection that, in the hearings before the House committee having charge of the bill, it was objected on behalf of the shipowners, obviously, as the context shows, upon the theory that such equality was in fact contemplated by the provision that, 'on cargo steamers, it would \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n be an injustice to keep a lot of men on watch, all night, and have nothing for them to do.' House Hearings on S. 136, Vol. 104, pt. 2, p. 5, Feb. 24, 1914. But the provision, fundamentally, is a measure of precaution against those perilous and often unexpected emergencies of the sea when only immediate and wakeful readiness for action may avert disaster or determine the issue between life and death; its effect as a regulator of working conditions is a matter of subordinate intent. A consideration of other safety provisions of the act will help to make this clear.\n Among them, the act (section 13, p. 1169 (Comp. St.  8363a)) provides that not less than 75 per centum of the crew in each department shall be able to understand any order given by the officers of such vessel, and that a certain percentage of her deck crew shall be of a rating not less than able seaman-meaning, except on the Great Lakes, a seaman, 19 years of age or upwards, who has had at least 3 years' service on deck at sea or on the Great Lakes. It also contains elaborate provisions (section 14, pp. 1170-1184 (Comp. St.  8258)) for the equipment of ocean-going vessels with life-saving appliances, and, among other things, requires ( page 1180) that:\n'At no moment of its voyage may any ocean cargo steam vessel of the United States have on board a total number of persons greater than that for whom accommodation is provided in the lifeboats on board.'\n\n None of these provisions is of much, if any, concern, except as a precaution against the unusual crises of the sea.\n As a ship pursues her way in security, perhaps for many years, these requirements for safety appliances and for able seamen may seem overexacting, and the language test, as well as a division of the watches into equal numbers, needlessly burdensome. But it is apparent, from the hearings and debates, that Congress looked forward to the possibility of other disasters like those of the \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n Titanic and the Volturno (the facts of which had been subjected to inquiry by its committees), where, in the one, the lack of lifeboats, probably caused the loss of many lives, although in a quite sea, and where, in the other, lifeboats lowered in a great storm were engulfed, it was thought by some, from the absence of the skill of able seamen in launching them or like that of the City of Rio de Janeiro (In re Pacific Mail S. S. Co., 130 F. 76, 64 C. C. A. 410, 69 L. R. A. 71), which sank with many of its lifeboats unlaunched because the crew of Chinese sailors were unable to understand the language in which the orders of their officers were given. The following from the opinion in that case (page 82, 83 (64 C. C. A. 416)) is peculiarly apposite:\n'It is, as was said by Judge Hawley in Re Meyer (D. C.) 74 F. 885, 'the duty of the owners of a steamer carrying goods and passengers, not only to provide a seaworthy vessel, but they must also provide the vessel with a crew adequate in number, and competent for their duty with reference to all the exigencies of the intended route'; not merely competent for the ordinary duties of an uneventful voyage, but for any exigency that is likely to happen. ... The case shows that the City of Rio de Janeiro left the port of Honolulu, on the voyage under consideration, with a crew of 84 Chinamen, officered by white men. The officers could not speak the language of the Chinese, and but two of the latter-the boatswain and chief fireman-could understand that of the officers. Consequently, the orders of the officers had to be communicated either through the boatswain or chief fireman, or by signs and signals. So far as appears, that seems to have worked well enough on the voyage in question, until the ship came to grief, and there arose the necessity for quick and energetic action in the darkness. In that emergency the crew was wholly inefficient and incompetent, as the sad results proved. The boats were in separate places on the ship. The sailors could not understand \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n the language in which the orders of the officers in command of the respective boats had to be given. It was too dark for them to see signs (if signs could have been intelligibly given), and only one of the two Chinese who spoke English appears to have known anything about the lowering of a boat, and there had been no drill of the crew in the matter of lowering them. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that but three of the boats were lowered, one of which was successfully launched by the efforts of Officer Coghlan and the ship's carpenter, another of which was swamped by one of the Chinese crew letting the after fall down with a run, and the third of which was lowered so slowly that it was swamped as the ship went down. We have no hesitation in holding that the ship was insufficiently manned, for the reason that the sailors were unable to understand and execute the orders made imperative by the exigency that unhappily arose, and resulted so disastrously to life, as well as to property.'\n\n See, also, R. S.  4463, amended by Act May 11, 1918, c. 72,  1, 40 Stat. 548 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8225); Flint & P. M. R. Co. v. Marine Ins. Co. (C. C.) 71 F. 210, 219; Northern Commercial Co v. Lindblom, 162 F. 250, 254, 89 C. C. A. 230.\n It is not unreasonable to conclude that Congress gress determined that each of the watches. like the crew as a whole, should be 'adequate in number,' competent and in a state of readiness 'for any exigency that is likely to happen'-such as a collision, the striking of the ship upon a reef of rocks or an iceberg, the sudden breaking out of fire, and other happenings of like disastrous tendency-and to this end meant to provide for successive and continuous watches to be constituted in numbers as nearly equal as the sum of the whole number would permit.\n In this conclusion we are fortified by the consideration that the legislation deals with seamen and the merchant marine and, consequently, the phrase 'divided into ... watches' is to be given the meaning which it had acquired in the language and usages of the trade to which the act relates, in accordance with the rule stated in Unwin v. \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n Hanson, (1891) L. R. 2 Q. B. 115, 119;\n'If the act is one passed with reference to a particular trade, business, or transaction, and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business, or transaction, knows and understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning, though it may differ from the common or ordinary meaning of the words.'\n\n In the understanding of the sailor, a division into 'watches,' as applied to the personnel of the ship, connotes a division as nearly equal as possible.\n'At sea a ship's crew is commonly divided into two watches: The master, second mate, fourth mate (if any), with one-half of the seamen and boys, forming the so-called 'starboard watch'; after four hours these are relived by the chief mate, and the third officer (if any), and the other half of the men, who from the 'port watch.\" Paasch, Marine Encyclopedia, 300, 301.\n\n R. H. Dana, Jr., in his 'Dictionary of Sea Terms,' p. 129, defines the term 'watch' as:\n'Also, a certain portion of a ship's company, appointed to stand a given length of time. In the merchant service all hands are divided into two watches, larboard and starboard, with a mate to command each.'\n\n And, at page 133, he says:\n'The men are divided as equally as possible, with reference to their qualities as able seamen, ordinary seamen, or boys (as all green hands are called, whatever their age may be); but, if the number is unequal, the larboard watch had the odd one, since the chief mate does not go aloft and do other duty in his watch, as the second mate does in his.'\n\n The point is emphasized by the use of the distinctive terms 'anchor watch' and 'sea watch'; the former meaning the lookout intrusted to one or two men when the vessel is at anchor, and the latter being used 'when one- half of a ship's crew is on duty' at sea. Paasch, 301.\n It is true that this meaning had its origin in the customs of the sea before the advent of steam, but there is nothing \n\n[269 U.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n to show that it has now a different meaning; and, with nothing in the context and no evidential circumstances to suggest the contrary, we fairly may assume that the use of the technical terms of the trade to which the statute relates imports their technical meaning.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 2.

CITY OF SEATTLE(1926)\nNo. 194\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. James B. Howe, of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Messrs. John F. Miller, Howard A. Hanson, and Thomas J. L. Kennedy, all of Seattle, Wash., for appellees. \n\n[271 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the beginning of the year 1919 the Puget Sound Power & Light Company owned and was operating two public utilities in the city of Seattle-one a power and lighting system and the other a street railway system. It still owns and operates the power and lighting system, and the Old Colony Trust Company is the trustee in a mortgage which was given thereon in 1921 to secure a large issue of bonds still outstanding.\n The city of Seattle now owns and operates the street railway system. The transfer from the Puget Sound Company to the city was effected March 31, 1919, under a contract between them entered into six weeks before. Anticipating that the system would be taxed for that year by reason of the company's ownership in the early months, they stipulated in the contract, and again in the deed of transfer, that 'state, county, and municipal taxes' laid on the property for 1919 should be borne and paid by them in proportions conforming to their respective periods of possession during the year. On that basis the company became obligated to pay one-fourth and the city three-fourths.\n Shortly after the transfer, state, county, and municipal taxes aggregating over $400,000 were laid on the property for the year 1919. Of that amount over $179,000 represented taxes imposed by the city. The taxes became a lien on the property March 15, 1919, and were listed against the company in the tax records by reason of its ownership on that date. The county treasurer was to collect the taxes and pay the money over to the state, county, and city in definite proportions. If it became necessary to collect through distraint and sale, that was to be done through the sheriff.\n When the taxes became due, the city refused to pay any part of them, and the county treasurer refused to receive \n\n[271 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n from the company the part allotted to it by the contract and deed of transfer, and also refused to receive from it the whole of the state and county taxes, unless it also paid the city taxes. Then, because the company would not accede to paying all, the treasurer caused the sheriff to take steps to collect the whole out of the power and lighting system by distraint and sale.\n The present suit was brought in the federal District Court by the Old Colony Trust Company, the mortgagee of the power and lighting system, to prevent the theatened distraint and sale of that property to pay the taxes so laid on the street railway property. The bill grounded the jurisdiction on diverse citizenship; the plaintiff being a Massachusetts corporation and the defendants being public corporations and individual citizens of the state of Washington. The original bill was brought when the sheriff was about to distrain the property. Besides setting forth the matters we have stated, it charged that the defendants were acting in concert and collusion to collect out of the mortgaged power and lighting property the taxes which had been laid on the street railway property and made a special lien thereon, and thus to relieve the city from the performance of its obligation under the contract and deed. The principal prayer was that the defendants be enjoined from resorting to the mortgaged property until after appropriate steps were taken to collect the taxes out of the property on which they were laid and were a lien. There was also a prayer for an interlocutory injunction. After the bill was filed, the sheriff distrained the mortgaged property, as before threatened, and gave public notice of intended sale. This was set up by the court's leave in a supplemental bill, which repeated the prayers of the original bill, and prayed, further, that the plaintiff, if coerced by the threatened sale into paying the taxes, be accorded the benefit of the lien on the street railway property. \n\n[271 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n The defendants appeared and moved that the two bills-original and supplemental-be dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject-matter and want of equity, both said to be apparent on the face of the bills. After a hearing on the prayer for an interlocutory injunction and the motion to dismiss, the prayer for the injunction was refused, and three weeks later a decree was entered, dismissing the bills for want of jurisdiction. The court allowed a direct appeal to this court, and also certified that the sole ground of the dismissal was that the suit was, in effect, a suit against the state, and therefore not cognizable in a federal District Court. The statute in force when the appeal was taken limits the consideration here to the jurisdictional question shown in the certificate.\n The defendants ask that the appeal be dismissed on two grounds, in support of which they make a showing by affidavits. One ground is that the taxes have been paid, and that this has put an end to the effort to collect them from the mortgaged property. The showing is that the taxes were paid by the mortgagor almost three weeks prior to the decree of dismissal. The plaintiff makes a counter showing that the payment was made by it and the mortgagor acting together; that they were coerced into this by an impending sale, which the court refused to restrain; and that they at the time, not only protested that the distraint and intended sale were arbitrary and an abusive use of legal process, but reserved all their legal and equitable rights. Obviously the fact of payment and its legal effect pertain to the merits, and cannot be considered on this jurisdictional appeal. The other ground is that, since the appeal was taken, a decree has been rendered in another suit between the mortgagor and some or all of the defendants, which determined the questions relating to these taxes. That decree may have a bearing on the merits, but affords no ground for dismissing this appeal. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Adams, \n\n[271 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n \n180 \nU.S. 28, 31\n, 21 S. Ct. 251; Male v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 97, 99\n, 36 S. Ct. 351.\n We come, then, to the question whether the suit was in effect a suit against the state. If it was, the court below was forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution to take jurisdiction of it; otherwise, the jurisdiction was plain.\n The bills did not name the state as a defendant; nor did they complain of any act or omission by it, or seek any relief against it. They did show that some of the taxes were state taxes and when collected were to be paid over to the state. But they were not directed against the collection of the taxes. On the contrary, they distinctly treated the taxes as valid and collectable. The complaint was that those who were attempting the collection were wrongfully pursuing a course which was so much in violation of the rights of the plaintiff as to entitle it to an injunction-not against collection but against that course of action. On this point the bills alleged that the street railway property, on which the taxes were laid and were a special lien, was readily available and amply sufficient to satisfy them; that the city, in acquiring that property, had engaged to pay three-fourths of them; and that with knowledge of these matters the defendants wrongfully and collusively entered into an arrangement to refrain from collecting any part of the taxes out of the street railway property or from the city, and to collect them out of the power and lighting property which was mortgaged to the plaintiffs; and that the distraint and threatened sale were in pursuance of that arrangement, and intended to relieve the city from its obligation through a sacrific of the plaintiff's mortgage security. In short, the charge was that the defendants were wrongfully and abusively using the process of collection for a purpose and in a mode at variance with applicable legal and equitable principles and hurtful to the plaintiff.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n We think it apparent, from this review of the bills, that the suit was not in name or in effect a suit against the state, but only a suit against state agents to restrain them from wrongful acts threatened and attempted under color of their agency.\n The test to be applied is illustrated in Hopkins v. Clemson College, \n221 \nU.S. 636\n, 31 S. Ct. 654, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 243. There a state agent, when sued on account of a wrongful act done under color of the agency, advanced the contention that the state was a necessary party, and that its immunity from suit extended to the agent. But this court, on a full review of prior decisions, rejected the contention and said (page 642 (31 S. Ct. 656)):\n'But immunity from suit is a high attribute of sovereignty-a prerogative of the state itself-which cannot be availed of by public agents when sued for their own torts. The Eleventh Amendment was not intended to afford them freedom from liability in any case where, under color of their office, they have injured one of the state's citizens. To grant them such immunity would be to create a privileged class, free from liability from wrongs inflicted or injuries threatened. Public agents must be liable to the law, unless they are to be put above the law.'\n\n In Poindexter v. Greenhow, \n114 U.S. 270\n, 285 et seq., 5 S. Ct. 903, 962, the question presented was whether a suit against a tax collector to recover specific property which he had distrained for a state tax and was proceeding to sell was in substance a suit against the state. Prior to the distraint the plaintiff had tendered in payment of the tax certain coupons from state bonds, and the collector had rejected them as not receivable for the tax. The plaintiff stood on the tender, and after the distraint brought the suit on the theory that the tender was valid, and the subsequent distraint wrongful. This court held that the suit was not against the state in form or in substance, but \n\n[271 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n against the collector for his personal wrong. In the opinion it was said ( pages 293, 299 (5 S. Ct. 915)):\n'Tried by every test which has been judicially suggested for the determination of the question, this cannot be considered to be a suit against the state. ... His (the plaintiff's) tender, as we have already seen, was equivalent to payment so far as concerns the legality of all subsequent steps by the collector to enforce payment by distraint of his property. He has the right to say he will not pay the amount a second time, even for the privilege of recovering it back. And if he chooses to stand upon a lawful payment once made, he asks no remedy to recover back taxes illegally collected, but may resist the exaction, and treat as a wrongdoer the officer who seizes his property to enforce it.'\n\n Other cases well in point, although not relating to taxes, are Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 619\n, 32 S. Ct. 340; Johnson v. Lankford, \n245 \nU.S. 541\n, 38 S.

The bill averred that there existed in the areas of the states of Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and Nevada, an injurious insect popularly called the alfalfa weevil, and scientifically known as the phytonomus posticus, which fed upon the leaves and foliage of the alfalfa plant, to the great damage of the crop; that the insect multiplied rapidly, and was propagated by means of eggs deposited by the female insect upon the leaves and stalks of the plant; that, when the hay was cured, the eggs clung to and remained dormant upon the hay, and even in the meal made from it; that the eggs and live weevils were likely to be carried to points where hay was transported, infecting the growing crop there; that when the hay was carried in common box cars the eggs and live weevils were likely to be shaken out and distributed along the route and communicated to the agricultural lands adjacent to the route; that a proper inspection to ascertain the presence of the eggs or weevils would require the tearing open of every bale of hay and sack of meal, involving a prohibitive cost of inspection, and that the only practical method of preventing the spread into uninfested districts was to prohibit the transportation of hay or meal from the district in which the weevil existed; that the pest is new to, and not generally distributed within, the state of Washington; that there is no known method of ridding a district infested of the pest; that subsequent to June 8, 1921, and \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n prior to September 17, 1921, information was received by the Washington director of agriculture that there was a probability of the introduction of the weevil into the state across its boundaries; that he thereupon investigated thoroughly the insect and the areas where such pests existed, and ascertained it to be in the whole of the state of Utah, all portions of the state of Idaho Lying south of Idaho county, the counties of Uinta and Lincoln in the state of Wyoming, the county of Delta in the state of Colorado, the counties of Malheur and Baker in the state of Oregon, and the county of Washoe in the state of Nevada; that he, with the approval of the Governor of the state, thereupon, on or about September 17, 1921, made and promulgated a quarantine regulation and order, under the terms of which he declared a quarantine against all of the above-described areas, and forbade the importation into Washington of alfalfa hay and alfalfa meal, except in sealed containers, and fixed the boundaries of the quarantine. The bill further averred that the defendant, knowing of the proclamation, and in violation thereof, had caused to be shipped into Washington, in common box cars, and not in sealed containers, approximately 100 cars of alfalfa hay, consigned from various points in the state of Idaho lying south of Idaho county, and through the state of Oregon and into the state of Washington, in direct violation of the quarantine order, and that, unless enjoined, the defendant would continue to make these shipments from such quarantined area in the state of Idaho into and through the state of Washington; that large quantities of alfalfa were grown in the eastern and central portions of Washington, and adjacent to the railroad lines of the defendant and other railroads over which such shipments of alfalfa hay were shipped and were likely to be shipped in the future, unless an injunction was granted, to the great and irreparable damage of the citizens of Washington growing alfalfa therein. A tempo- \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n rary injunction was issued, and then a demurrer was filed by the defendants. The demurrer was overruled. An answer was filed, and in each of the pleadings was set out the claim by the defendant that the action and proclamation of the director of agriculture and the Governor, and chapter 105 of the Laws of Washington of 1921, under which they acted, were in contravention of the interstate commerce clause of the federal Constitution, and in conflict with an act of Congress.\n At the hearing there was evidence on behalf of the state that the Oregon-Washington and Northern Pacific Railroads ran through the parts of the state where the alfalfa was raised; that the weevil had first appeared in Utah in 1904 in Salt Lake City, and that it had spread about 10 miles a year; that it came from Russia and Southern Europe; that it would be impossible to adopt any method of inspection of alfalfa hay to keep out the weevil, not prohibitory in cost; that in Europe the weevil is not a serious pest, because its natural enemies exist there, and they keep it down; that the United States government had attempted to introduce parasites, but that it takes a long time to secure a natural check from such a method; that methods by using poison sprays, by burning, and in other ways had been used to attack the pest, but that no one method has been entirely successful; that there is no practical way of eliminating the beetles completely, if the field once becomes infected, and the continuance of the pest will be indefinite; that the great danger of spreading the infection is through the transfer of hay from one section to another. In behalf of the defendant it was testified that the prevalent opinion in regard to the spread of the alfalfa weevil and the damage it was doing was vestly exaggerated; that the spread of the weevil from hay shipped in the cars through the state of Washington was decidedly improbable. The superior court made the temporary injunction permanent and the \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of Washington affirmed the decree. This is a writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1214) to that decree.\n By chapter 105 of the Washington Session Laws of 1921, p. 308, the director is given the power and duty, with the approval of the Governor, to establish and maintain quarantine needed to keep out of the state contagion or infestation by disease of trees and plants and injurious insects or other pests, to institute an inspection to prevent any infected articles from coming in, except upon a certificate of investigation by such director, or in his name by an inspector. Upon information received by the director of the existence of any infectious plant, disease, insect or weed pest, new to or not generally distributed within the state, dangerous to the plant industry of the state, he is required to proceed to investigate the same, and then enforce necessary quarantine. There is a provision for punishment of a fine of not less than $100, or more than $1, 000, or by both such fine and imprisonment, for violation of the act.\n In the absence of any action taken by Congress on the subject-matter, it is well settled that a state, in the exercise of its police power, may establish quarantines against human beings, or animals, or plants, the coming in of which may expose the inhabitants, or the stock, or the trees, plants, or growing crops, to disease, injury, or destruction thereby, and this in spite of the fact that such quarantines necessarily affect interstate commerce.\n Chief Justice Marshall, in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat, 1, speaking of inspection laws, says at page 203:\n'They form a portion of that immense mass of legislation, which embraces everything within the territory of a state, not surrendered to the general government, all which can be most advantageously exercised by the states themselves. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the in- \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n ternal commerce of a state, and those which respect turnpike roads, ferries, etc., are component parts of this mass.'\n\n Again he says at page 205:\n'The acts of Congress, passed in 1796 and 1799, ... empowering and directing the officers of the general government to conform to and assist in the execution of the quarantine and health laws of a state, proceed, it is said, upon the idea that these laws are constitutional. It is undoubtedly true, that they do proceed upon that idea; and the constitutionality of such laws has never, so far as we are informed, been denied. But they do not imply an acknowledgment that a state may rightfully regulate commerce with foreign nations, or among the states; for they do not imply that such laws are an exercise of that power, or enacted with a view to it. On the contrary, they are treated as quarantine and health laws, are so denominated in the acts of Congress, and are considered as flowing from the acknowledged power of a state to provide for the health of its citizens. But as it was apparent that some of the provisions made for this purpose, and in virtue of this power, might interfere with and be affected by the laws of the United States, made for the regulation of commerce, Congress, in that spirit of harmony and conciliation which ought always to characterize the conduct of governments standing in the relation which that of the Union and those of the states bear to each other, has directed its officers to aid in the execution of these laws, and has, in some measure, adapted its own legislation to this object, by making provisions in aid of those of the states. But in making these provisions the opinion is unequivocally manifested that Congress may control the state laws, so far as it may be necessary to control them, for the regulation of commerce.'\n\n This court, in the Minnesota Rate Cases, 33 S. Ct. 729, 743, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 406 (57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18), said:\n'Quarantine regulations are essential measures of protection which the states are free to adopt when they do \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n not come into conflict with federal action. In view of the need of conforming such measures to local conditions, Congress from the beginning has been content to leave the matter for the most part, notwithstanding its vast importance, to the states and has repeatedly acquiesced in the enforcement of state laws. ... Such laws undoubtedly operate upon interstate and foreign commerce. They could not be effective otherwise. They cannot, of course, be made the cover for discriminations and arbitrary enactments having no reasonable relation to health (Hannibal & St. J. Railroad Co. v. Husen, \n95 \nU.S. 465, 472\n, 473 S. (24 L. Ed. 527)); but the power of the state to take steps to prevent the introduction or spread of disease, although interstate and foreign commerce are involved (subject to the paramount authority of Congress if it decides to assume control), is beyond question (Morgan's, etc., S. S. Co. v. Louisiana, \n118 U.S. 455\n (6 S. Ct. 1114); Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Haber, \n169 U.S. 613\n (18 S. Ct. 488); Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 U.S. 1\n (20 S. Ct. 251); Rasmussen v. Idaho, \n181 U.S. 198\n (21 S. Ct. 594); Compagnie Francaise, &c. v. Board of Health, \n186 U.S. 380\n (22 S. Ct. 811); Reid v. Colorado, \n187 U.S. 137\n, 138 (23 S. Ct. 92); Asbell v. Kansas, \n209 U.S. 251\n (28 S. Ct. 485, 14 Ann. Cas. 1101)).'\n\n Counsel for the company argues that the case of Railroad Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 465\n, is an authority to show that this law as carried out by the proclamation goes too far, in that it forbids importations from certain parts of Idaho, of Utah, of Nevada, of alfalfa hay, without qualification and without any limit of time. The Husen Case is to be distinguished from the other cases cited, in that the Missouri statute there held invalid was found by the court not to be a quarantine provision at all. It forbade the importation into Missouri for eight months of the year of any Texas, Mexican, or Indian cattle, without regard to whether the cattle were diseased or not, and without regard to the question whether they came from a part of the country where they had been exposed to contagion. \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n We think that here the investigation required by the Washington law and the investigation actually made into the existence of this pest and its geographical location makes the law a real quarantine law and not a mere inhibition against importation of alfalfa from a large part of the country without regard to the conditions which might make its importation dangerous.\n The second objection to the validity of this Washington law and the action of the state officers, however, is more formidable. Under the language used in Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, and the Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, the exercise of the police power of quarantine, in spite of its interfering with interstate commerce, is permissible under the interstate commerce clause of the federal Constitution 'subject to the paramount authority of Congress, if it decides to assume control.'\n By the Act of Congress of August 20, 1912, 37 Stat. 315, c. 308, s 8, as amended by the Act of March 4, 1917, 39 Stat. 1165, c. 179 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 8760), it is made unlawful to import or offer for entry into the United States any nursery stock unless permit had been issued by the Secretary of Agriculture under regulations prescribed by him.\n Section 2 of the act of 1912 (Comp. St. s 8753) makes it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to notify the Secretary of Agriculture of the arrival of any nursery stock, and forbids the shipment from one state or territory or district of the United States into another of any nursery stock imported into the United States without notifying the Secretary of Agriculture, or, at his direction, the proper state, territorial, or district official to which the nursery stock was destined. Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine that such nursery stock may result in the entry of plant diseases or insect pests, he shall promulgate his determination of this, but shall give due notice and a public hearing, at which any interested party might appear before the promulgation. \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n Section 7 (Comp. St. s 8758) provides that whenever, in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of any tree, plant, or fruit disease, or any injurious insect, not theretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and through the United States, the Secretary shall determine that it was necessary to forbid the importation into the United States, he shall promulgate such determination, and such importations are thereafter prohibited.\n Section 8 of the act was amended by the Agricultural Appropriation Act of March 4, 1917, and reads as follows:\n'Sec. 8. That the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to quarantine any state, territory, or District of the United States, or any portion thereof, when he shall determine that such quarantine is necessary to prevent the spread of a dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, new to or not theretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States; and the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to give notice of the establishment of such quarantine to common carriers doing business in or through such quarantined area, and shall publish in such newspapers in the quarantined area as he shall select notice of the establishment of quarantine. That no person shall ship or offer for shipment to any common carrier, nor shall any common carrier receive for transportation or transport, nor shall any person carry or transport from any quarantined state or territory or District of the United States, or from any quarantined portion thereof, into or through any other state or territory or District, any class of nursery stock or any other class of plants, fruits, vegetables, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products, or any class of stone or quarry products, or any other article of any character whatsoever, capable of carrying any dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, specified in the notice of quarantine except as hereinafter provided. That it shall be unlawful to \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 98]\n\u00a0\n move, or allow to be moved, any class of nursery stock or any other class of plants, fruits, vegetables, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products, or any class of stone or quarry products or any other article of any character whatsoever, capable of carrying any dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, specified in the notice of quarantine hereinbefore provided, and regardless of the use for which the same is intended, from any quarantined state or territory or District of the United States or quarantined portion thereof, into or through any other state or territory or District, in manner or method or under conditions other than those prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture. That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of Agriculture, when the public interests will permit, to make and promulgate rules and regulations which shall permit and govern the inspection, disinfection, certification, and method and manner of delivery and shipment of the class of nursery stock or of any other class of plants, fruits, vegetables, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products, or any class of stone or quarry products, or any other article of any character whatsoever, capable of carrying any dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, specified in the notice of quarantine hereinbefore provided, and regardless of the use for which the same is intended, from a quarantined state or territory or District of the United States, or quarantined portion thereof, into or through any other state or territory or District; and the Secretary of Agriculture shall give notice of such rules and regulations as hereinbefore provided in this section for the notice of the establishment of quarantine: Provided, that before the Secretary of Agriculture shall promulgate his determination that it is necessary to quarantine any state, territory, or District of the United States, or portion thereof, under the authority given in this section, he shall, after due notice to interested parties, give a public hearing under such rules and regulations \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 99]\n\u00a0\n as he shall prescribe, at which hearing any interested party may appear and be heard, either in person or by attorney.'\n\n Section 10 of the act (Comp. St. s 8762) provides that any person who shall violate any provisions of the act, or who shall forge, counterfeit, or destroy any certificate provided for in the act or in the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not exceeding $ 500, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. It is made the duty of the United States attorneys diligently to prosecute any violations of this act which are brought to their attention by the Secretary of Agriculture, or which come to their notice by other means, and that, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall appoint from existing bureaus in his office a commission of five members employed therein.\n It is impossible to read this statute and consider its scope without attributing to Congress the intention to take over to the Agricultural Department of the federal government the care of the horticulture and agriculture of the states, so far as these may be affected injuriously by the transportation in foreign and interstate commerce of anything which by reason of its character can convey disease to and injure trees, plants, or crops. All the sections look to a complete provision for quarantine against importation into the country and quarantine as between the states under the direction and supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture.\n The courts of Washington and the counsel for the state rely on the decision of this court in Reid v. Colorado, 23 S. Ct. 92, \n187 U.S. 137\n, as an authority to sustain the validity of the Washington law before us.\n The Reid Case involved the constitutionality of a conviction of Reid for violation of \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 100]\n\u00a0\n an act of Colorado to prevent the introduction of infectious or contagious diseases among the cattle and horses of that state. The law made it unlawful for any person, association, or corporation to bring or drive any cattle or horses, suffering from such disease, or which had within 90 days prior thereto been herded or brought into contact with any other cattle or horses suffering from such disease, into the state, unless a certificate or bill of health could be produced from the state veterinary sanitary board that the cattle and horses were free from all infectious or contagious diseases. It was urged that it was inconsistent with the federal Animal Industry Act (23 Stat. 31 (Comp. St. ss 850, 8690-8697)). This directed a study of contagious and communicable diseases of animals and the best method of treating them by the federal Commissioner of Agriculture, to be certified to the executive authority of each state and the co-operation of such authority was invited. If the authorities of the state adopted the plans and methods advised by the department, or if such authorities adopted measures of their own which the department approved, then the money appropriated by Congress was to be used in conducting investigations, and in aiding such disinfection and quarantine measures as might be necessary to prevent the spread of the diseases in question from one state or territory into another. This court held that Congress did not intend by the act to override the power of the states to care for the safety of the property of their people, because it did not undertake to invest any officer or agent of the department with authority to go into a state and without its assent take charge of the work of suppressing or extirpating contagious, infectious, or communicable diseases there prevailing, or to inspect cattle or give a certificate of freedom from disease for cattle of superior authority to state certificates.\n It is evident that the federal statute under consideration in the Reid Case was an effort to induce the states to \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 101]\n\u00a0\n co-operate with the general government in measures to suppress the spread of disease, without at all interfering with the action of the state in quarantining or taking any other measures to extirpate it or prevent its spread. Indeed, the Commissioner of Agriculture in that case was to aid the state authorities in their quarantine and other measures from federal appropriation. The act we are considering is very different. It makes no reference whatever to co-operation with state authorities. It proposes the independent exercise of federal authority with reference to quarantine in interstate commerce. It covers the whole field so far as the spread of the plant disease by interstate transportation can be affected and restrained. With such authority vested in the Secretary of Agriculture, and with such duty imposed upon him, the state laws of quarantine that affect interstate commerce and thus federal law, cannot stand together. The relief sought to protect the different states, in so far as it depends on the regulation of interstate commerce, must be obtained through application to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n In the relation of the states to the regulation of interstate commerce by Congress there are two fields. There is one in which the state cannot interfere at all, even in the silence of Congress. In the other, and this is the one in which the legitimate exercise of the state's police power brings it into contact with interstate commerce, so as to affect that commerce, the state may exercise its police power until Congress has by affirmative legislation occupied the field by regulating interstate commerce and so necessarily has excluded state action.\n Cases of the latter type are the Southern Railway Co. v. Reid, 32 S. Ct. 140, \n222 U.S. 424\n; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Washington, 32 S. Ct. 160, \n222 U.S. 370\n, 378; C. R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Elevator Co., 33 S. Ct. 174, \n226 \nU.S. 426, 435\n, 46 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 203; Erie Railroad Co. v. New York, 34 S. Ct. 756, \n233 \nU.S. 671, 681\n, 52 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 266, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 138; and Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stroud, 45 S. Ct. 243, \n267 U.S. 404\n. \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 102]\n\u00a0\n Some stress is laid by the counsel of the state on the case of Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., 29 S. Ct. 214, \n211 U.S. 612\n. There the question was whether a state court might by mandamus compel a railroad company, under its common-law obligation as a common carrier to afford equal local switching service to its shippers, notwithstanding the fact that the cars in regard to which the service was claimed were two-thirds of them in interstate commerce and one-third in intrastate commerce. The contention was that the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act put such switching wholly in control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The case was one on the border line, three judges dissenting. The number of cases decided since that case and above cited have made it clear that the rule, as it always had been, was not intended in that case to be departed from. That rule is that there is a field in which the local interests of states touch so closely upon interstate commerce that, in the silence of Congress on the subject, the states may exercise their police powers, and local switchings, as in that case, and quarantine, as in the case before us, are in that field. But, when Congress has acted and occupied the field, as it has here, the power of the states to act is prevented or suspended.\n It follows that, pending the existing legislation of Congress as to quarantine of diseased trees and plants in interstate commerce, the statute of Washington on the subject cannot be given application. It is suggested that the states may act in the absence of any action by the Secretary of Agriculture, that it is left to him to allow the states to quarantine, and that if he does not act there is no invalidity in the state action. Such construction as that cannot be given to the federal statute. The obligation to act without respect to the states is put directly upon the Secretary of Agriculture, whenever quarantine, in his judgment, is necessary. When he does not \n\n[270 U.S. 87, 103]\n\u00a0\n act, it must be presumed that it is not necessary. With the federal law in force, state action is illegal and unwarranted.\n The decree of the Supreme Court of Washington is\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissenting.\n We cannot think Congress intended that the Act of March 4, 1917, without more, should deprive the states of power to protect themselves against threatened disaster like the one disclosed by this record.\n If the Secretary of Agriculture had taken some affirmative action, the problem would be a very different one. Congress could have exerted all the power which this statute delegated to him by positive and direct enactment. If it had said nothing whatever, certainly the state could have resorted to the quarantine; and this same right, we think, should be recognized when its agent has done nothing.\n It is a serious thing to paralyze the efforts of a state to protect her people against impending calamity, and leave them to the slow charity of a far-off and perhaps supine federal bureau. No such purpose should be attributed to Congress, unless indicated beyond reasonable doubt. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOTTINGER v.

They sought injunctions against enforcement of the Act of June 2, 1923, c. 899, laws of New York 1923, by which the Legislature directed that gas of 650 British thermal units should be sold at not more than $1 per 1,000 feet. Prior to June 2, 1923, under orders of the commission, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company had been charging $1.15 and the Kings County Lighting Company $1.30 per 1,000 feet for gas of 537 British thermal units.\n The causes were referred to different masters. They took much evidence, and each reported that the rate prescribed by the Legislature would yield less than 5 per centum upon the fair value of the complainants' property devoted to public use. With some exceptions, not now \n\n[272 U.S. 579, 581]\n\u00a0\n important, these reports were approved, and the court adjudged the statute confiscatory and therefore invalid; also that it was unreasonable and invalid in respect of the standard of 650 British thermal units. Kings County Lighting Co. v. Prendergast (D. C.) 7 F.(2d) 192; Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. Prendergast (D. C.) 7 F. (2d) 628.\n The commission declined to ask for an appeal to this court. The Attorney General, upon petitions which allege 'that in substance the decree restrains the defendants from enforcing in any way chapter 899 of the Laws of 1923 of the state of New York and declares that said statute violates or is in contravention of section 10 of article 1 and of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,' sued out broad appeals and has presented many assignments of error-107 in No. 358, and 21 in No. 365. But we find no reason whatever advanced by him in brief or oral argument which would justify reversal of either decree.\n The statute was clearly confiscatory in effect, and there was no necessity for the District Court to consider any other objection thereto. We have not done so.\n The decrees will be modified, by excluding therefrom such parts as adjudge the statute invalid for any reason except conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, because confiscatory in effect. Thus modified, both are affirmed. All costs will be taxed against appellant.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOTTINGER v.

Thereafter the New York Public Service Commission made careful investigation of the property and operations of appellee and prescribed a rate not exceeding $1.15 per 1,000 for gas of 537 British thermal units, effective October 1, 1922, to continue for one year. Acceptance of this order, the company now claims, consummated a binding agreement with the state. The Legislature, by an act approved June 2, 1923 (Laws 1923, c. 899), effective immediately, directed that thereafter in New York City not more than $1 per 1,000 feet should be demanded for gas of 650 British thermal units.\n By an original bill in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, wherein the Public Service Commission and the Attorney General of that state were the defendants, appellee attached the Act of June 2, 1923, as confiscatory, and prayed for an injunction prohibiting enforcement thereof. It also asked that the act be adjudged void, because enforcement would impair the \n\n[272 U.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n company's contract with the state under the commission's order, contrary to article 1, section 10, of the federal Constitution, further, that the act be declared invalid because of the impossibility of supplying immediately and with safety to consumers gas of 650 thermal units. Answers followed, and the matter went to a master, who took much proof, found the value of the property dedicated to public use, cost of operation, the impossibility of furnishing safely gas of the prescribed standard, etc. He reported the $1 rate would not yield a fair return upon such property, estimated according to any reasonable standard, and therefore recommended that the act be declared confiscatory and unenforceable. He further recommended that it be declared invalid because in conflict with article 1, section 10, also because compliance therewith was practically impossible. The court confirmed this report without material modification, adjudged as recommended and granted the injunction prayed for. Consolidated Gas Co. of New York v. Prendergast (D. C.) 6 F.(2d) 243.\n The commission, wisely, we think, declined to ask review here of the final decree. The Attorney General sued out a broad, separate appeal. His petition therefor alleges:\n'That in substance the decree restrains the defendants from enforcing in any way chapter 899 of the Laws of 1923 of the state of New York and declares that said statute violates or is in contravention of section 10 of article 1 and of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n There is an enormous record. Seventyone assignments of error assail rulings of the court and question many of the master's actions and conclusions.\n Although somewhat oracular-as in the lines which make solemn declaration concerning the position which this court must ultimately take regarding valuations in rate cases-and too much burdened with unimportant dissertations, the report of the master contains a valuable analysis of the relevant evidence and clear statements \n\n[272 U.S. 576, 579]\n\u00a0\n concerning values. It also sets out distinctly what the evidence discloses as to the cost of production, expenses of the business, etc. He concluded that the prescribed rate of $1 per 1,000 feet would not yield a return of 6 per centum, and was therefore confiscatory. With this conclusion the court below agreed, and we find nothing whatever suggested by the Attorney General in brief or oral argument which would justify material modification or reversal of the final decree, in so far as it so adjudges and directs appropriate injunctions.\n As the statute is clearly confiscatory, and therefore invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, it was unnecessary for the trial court to consider other objections thereto, and we have not done so.\n The decree of the District Court will be modified, by excluding therefrom those parts which declare the act invalid for any reason except that enforcement would result in confiscation. Thus modified, it is affirmed. All costs of the appeal will be taxed against appellant.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPALMETTO FIRE INS. CO. v.

Younger, of Celina, Ohio, for appellee Conn.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Raymond Fellows and Joseph F. Gould, both of Bangor, Me., for appellee Spencer.\n Mr. T. L. McIntosh, of Madison, Wis., for appellee Johnson.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases all raise the same question. The first, Palmetto Fire Insurance Company v. Conn, is a suit to enjoin the Ohio Superintendent of Insurance from revoking the license of the plaintiff, a corporation of South Carolina, to do business in Ohio, on the ground that it has violated statutes of the latter State. These statutes forbid the insurance of property in the State except by a legally authorized agent, resident in Ohio, and tax the business lawfully done there. They provide also that any one who procures an application for insurance shall be held to be the agent of the party thereafter issuing the policy. The plaintiff says that if the statutes are held to apply to what it has done they are invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The case was tried before a statutory court of three judges and an injunction was refused. 9 F.(2d) 202. \n\n[272 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n The facts are simple. The plaintiff made a contract of insurance in Michigan with the Chrysler Sales Corporation, a Michigan corporation which sells all the automobiles made by the Chrysler Corporation. This contract purported to insure purchasers of Chrysler cars against fire and theft, and to become automatically effective from the date on which the purchaser took delivery or a bill of sale of the car; the Chrysler Company to send a monthly report to the plaintiff of all cars for which insurance was thus provided and to pay premiums accordingly at Detroit. If any one bought a car he got the insurance whether he wished it or not as part of his bargain, and a certificate was sent to him by the plaintiff. The question is whether this transaction brought the plaintiff within the taxing power of Ohio. If it did not, the power of the State to exclude the Company altogether could not be used as means to accomplish a result beyond the State's constitutional power. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Tafoya, \n270 \nU.S. 426\n, 46 S. Ct. 331, March 15, 1926\n\n\n Manifestly there was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and the Chrysler Sales Corporation, without more, that Ohio could lay hold of, even if it insured property in Ohio. But the contract contemplated and provided for a benefit to third persons if, when, and where they complied with its conditions. When a man bought a car in Ohio, by that act he made effective the agreement of the Company to insure future purchasers, and imposed upon it an obligation that did not exist before. It is true that the obligation arose from a contract made under the law of another State, but the act was done in Ohio and the capacity to do it came from the law of Ohio, so that the cooperation of that law was necessary to the obligation imposed. It would be held in some jurisdiction that the purchaser became party to a contract with the insurance company. By universal consent he at least would become the beneficiary of a contract for his benefit. \n\n[272 U.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n Whatever technical form may be given to the reasoning, the substance is that by acts done in Ohio the purchaser obtains for himself the advantage of insurance that before that moment did not exist. It does not matter whether his getting it was a large or an inconspicuous feature of his bargain. It was part of it in any event, and we cannot doubt that the lower Court was right in holding that in such circumstances the State could insist upon its right to tax. It would be extravagant to say that the State's general power to deny to the plaintiff the to enter or remain within it for business unless it paid for these transactions as a part of the price, must be denied upon constitutional grounds.\n The two suits in Wisconsin, Clark Motor Company v. Smith, Commissioner of Insurance, and Chrysler Sales Corporation v. Smith, were begun about the same time as the Ohio case. The Clark Motor Company described itself as a distributor, buying cars from the Chrysler Sales Company and selling them to retail dealers, known as dealers. Neither distributor nor dealer acts as agent for the Chrysler Sales Company, but each buys and sells on its own behalf. The position of the Chrysler Sales Company, the other plaintiff, has been described. The Commissioner of Insurance treats the sales as contravening statutes of Wisconsin similar to those of Ohio. A Court of three judges refused an injunction against his enforcing the Acts. 9 F.(2d) 666. We are of opinion that the decision was correct. It is argued that the statutes were misconstrued by the Court. An appeal to this Court is allowed when an injunction is granted or refused on the ground of the alleged unconstitutionality of a State law. If we assume that other questions are open, still it is not desirable that the Courts of the United States should go beyond necessity to instruct the officials of a State as to the meaning of a State law. Unless the case is very clear their action should be left to the control of the State \n\n[272 U.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n Courts. There are plausible reasons in this case for following the local interpretation and we think that the Court below was right in accepting the Commissioner's view. Other arguments thrown in as makeweights do not need to be discussed. The fact that the cost of the insurance was taken up into the price of a machine otherwise lawfully sold does not prevent the insurance being reached. See Herbert v. The Shanley Co., \n242 \nU.S. 591\n, 37 S. Ct. 232. The question raised by these bills is the general one, whether the State laws can be applied to this insurance. That we have answered. Exactly how far the laws can go and what proceedings can or cannot be taken, may be left to be determined, if the questions arise, in the State Courts.\n The cases from Maine, Chrysler Sales Corporation v. Spencer, Insurance Commissioner, and Utterback-Gleason Company v. Spencer, are like the last, and follow the Wisconsin decision after a full discussion (D. C .). 9 F.(2d) 674. These decisions also must stand.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPANAMA R. CO. v. VASQUEZ(1926)\nNo. 260\nArgued: January 13, 1926Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 557, 558]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard Reid Rogers, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 557, 559]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Martin A. Schenck, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by the personal representative of a deceased seaman against the owner of the ship whereon he was serving at the time of his death, to recover damages for the death on the ground that it was caused by the owner's negligence in providing an unfit lighting appliance to be used by him in his work. The right of action was based on section 20 of the Semaen's Act of 1915, c. 153, 38 Stat. 1164, as amended by section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8337a). A judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the highest court of the state, and the defendant brings the case here.\n The sole question presented is whether state courts may entertain such actions, the defendant's contention being that they are cognizable only in the federal District Courts.\n Amended section 20,1 as heretofore construed, changes the prior maritime law of the United States by giving to seamen injured through the negligence of their employers, \n\n[271 U.S. 557, 560]\n\u00a0\n and to their personal representatives where the injuries result in death, the rights given to railway employees and their personal representatives by the Employers' Liability Act of 1908 and its amendments (Comp. St.  8657-8665). Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391. And the procedural provisions therein have been construed-when read in connection with sections 24 (third) and 256 (third) of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  981, 1233), and in the light of constitutional rules respecting admiralty and maritime jurisdiction-to mean that the new substantive rights may be asserted and enforced either in actions in personam against the employers in courts administering common-law remedies, with a right of trial by jury, or in suits in admiralty in courts administering remedies in admiralty, without trial by jury, but always taking the changed maritime law as the basis and measure of the rights asserted. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, supra.\n The sections of the Judicial Code just cited, while investing the federal District Courts with jurisdiction 'exclusive of the courts of the several states' of all 'civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' contain an excepting clause expressly 'saving to suitors in all cases the right to a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' This clause is a continuation of a like clause in the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 73), and always has been construed as permitting substantive rights under the maritime law to recover money for service rendered, or as damages for tortious injuries, to be asserted and enforced in actions in personam according to the course of the common law. Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 384\n, 38 S. Ct. 501; Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, pages 388, 390. And it uniformly has been regarded as permitting such actions to be brought in either the federal courts or the state courts, as the possessor of the right may elect. Leon v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185, 188; Schoonmaker v. Gilmore, \n102 U.S. 118\n; Chappell v. \n\n[271 U.S. 557, 561]\n\u00a0\n Bradshaw, \n128 \nU.S. 132, 134\n, 9 S. Ct. 40; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255\n, 42 S. Ct. 475; Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 123\n, 44 S. Ct. 274.\n In so saying, we must be understood as fully recognizing what often has been held in other cases-that the saving clause does not include suits in rem or other forms of proceeding unknown to the common law. The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, 431; The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555, 571; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 218\n, 37 S. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900. But an action in personam to recover damages for tort is one of the most familiar of the common-law remedies, and it is such a remedy at law that is contemplated by amended section 20 of the Seamen's Act and invoked in this case.\n The defendant insists that the saving clause refers only to rights recognized by the maritime law as existing in 1789, when the clause first was adopted, and therefore does not include rights brought into the maritime law by subsequent legislative changes. We think the clause has a broader meaning, looks to the future as well as the past, and includes new as well as old rights, if only they are such as readily admit of assertion and enforcement in actions in personam according to the course of the common law. This is the view that was taken in Steamboat Company v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 533.\n The defendant also points to the provision in amended section 20 saying, 'Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located,' and argues therefrom that Congress has manifested a purpose to restrict the enforcement of the newly given rights to the federal District Courts. The provision is not aptly worded to express that purpose, and taken alone is confusing. We think it falls short of that certainty which naturally would be manifested in making an intended departure from the long-prevailing policy evidenced by \n\n[271 U.S. 557, 562]\n\u00a0\n the saving clause in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and in the two sections of the Judicial Code, and that the more reasonable view is that it is intended to regulate venue and not to deal with jurisdiction as between federal and state courts. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, pages 384, 391; Re East River Co., \n266 \nU.S. 355, 368\n, 45 S. Ct. 114; Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33\n, 46 S. Ct. 410 (decided April 12, 1926).\n We well might have rested our decision here on the conclusion reached in Engel v. Davenport, where we said:\n'It is clear that the state courts have jurisdiction concurrently with the federal courts, to enforce the right of action established by the Merchant Marine Act as a part of the maritime law.'\n\n But out of deference to the elaborate presentation of the question in this case we have stated and dealt with the several points advanced as making for a different conclusion.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 20.

Davis, both of Montgomery, Ala., for appellants.\n Mr. Harry T. Smith, of Mobile, Ala., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The record in this cause has been made up with such disregard of the rules that we cannot undertake to examine the evidence or to discuss seriatim the 34 jumbled assignments of error. It would be permissible to dismiss the appeal, Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 42 S. Ct. 264, \n258 U.S. 165\n, 174; but, considering the public interest and with purpose to prevent any serious miscarriage of \n\n[271 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n justice, we have examined the pleadings, the master's report, the opinions and the decrees. In the circumstances we think the proper course is to modify and then to affirm the decree of the court below.\n By an original bill of August 14, 1922, the gas company asked that members of the Alabama Public Service Commission be restrained from attempting to enforce a rate schedule which it alleged was confiscatory.\n A supplemental bill, filed April 18, 1923, after referring to the original bill and proceedings thereunder, among other things, alleged: That, as provided by the Act of the Alabama Legislature approved October 1, 1920 (Gen. Acts 1920 (Sp. Sess.) p. 38) the commission ascertained and declared the value of the company's property for rate-making purposes as of December 31, 1921, at the latter's request and expense. That this valuation was made under a valid contract with the state and she was obligated to accept it for rate-making purposes. That by an unconstitutional act approved February 13, 1923 (Gen. Acts 1923, p. 62), the Legislature undertook to authorize, and the commission intended to make, another valuation. That so to do would violate the contract which the state deliberately entered into and greatly injure the company. In addition to the relief originally asked the prayer was for a decree declaring the commission's valuation final for all rate-making purposes and the challenged act invalid. Also for an injunction restraining the commission from attempting to establish any new valuation for rate-making purposes.\n Upon application for an injunction under the supplemental bill the District Court-composed of two Circuit Judges and one District Judge-held ( June 4, 1923) that no continuing contract between the state and the company resulted from the commission's action in respect of the first valuation and refused to enjoin the proposed revaluation. District Judge Clayton expressed another view. \n\n[271 U.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n Later-October 31, 1923-the District Court, Judge Clayton only presiding, entered the following final decree:\n\n\n (1)\n That the value of the properties of the Mobile Gas Company as of December 31, 1921, has been definitely fixed for the future rate-making purpose by contract entered into by the state of Alabama, acting by and through the Alabama Public Service Commission, on the one part, and the Mobile Gas Company, on the other part, and that the defendants in this case and their successors in office are hereby forever enjoined from attempting to impair the obligations of this contract by failing or refusing to accept the said valuation as a permanent basic valuation as of December 31, 1921, for all future rate-making purposes.\n\n\n (2)\n Also that the tariff of rates established by the Alabama Public Service Commission, by its order of July 24, 1922, is confiscatory and void, and further that the Mobile Gas Company is entitled to earn a net profit of 8 per cent. per annum upon $2,007,520.68, consisting of $1,969, 565, which was established as the permanent basic valuation of the plaintiff's property as of December 31, 1921, and $37,955.68, which covers additions to property from December 31, 1921, to December 31, 1922, and that in ascertaining said net profit the plaintiff must be allowed a depreciation reserve of 2 1\/2 per cent. upon the value of the property, and a further credit of $25,000, amortized over a period of five years, on account of the expenses incurred in resisting the enforcement of said confiscatory tariff of rates, and also to a further credit of $27,025.77, amortized over a period of five years, being losses imposed upon the plaintiff between August 12, 1920, and November 1, 1920, by reason of the refusal of the Alabama Public Service Commission to permit the operation of a schedule of rates filed by the plaintiff on August 12, 1920. \n\n[271 U.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n (3) That defendants Andrew G. Patterson, Fitzhugh Lee, and Frank P. Morgan, and their successors in office, as members of the Alabama Public Service Commission, be and and they are hereby forever enjoined from enforcing or attempting to enforce the said tariff of rates promulgated by the order of the Alabama Public Service Commission on July 24, 1922, or from establishing or attempting to enforce any other tariff of rates which is insufficient to produce a return of 8 per cent. per annum upon the then value of the plaintiff's properties used and useful in the public service, assuming as a basic valuation of said company's property on the 31st day of December, 1922, the sum of $2,007,520.68. The court reserves the power to modify said injunction at any time, when by reason of changed conditions any tariff of rates, the establishment and enforcement of which is hereby forbidden, may become compensatory.\n\n\n (4)\n Also that the defendants, and their successors in office, are hereby forever enjoined from compelling or attempting to compel the plaintiff to submit its properties, books, documents, accounts, and vouchers to examination by the Alabama Public Service Commission, or its representatives, for the purpose of repudiating or in any wise impairing the valuation of the plaintiff's properties as of the 31st day of December, 1921, as a basic valuation for future rate-making purposes.\n\n\n (5)\n Also that a writ of permanent injunction issue from this court in accordance with this decree.\n\n\n (6)\n The exceptions to the report of the special master are hereby overruled, and the said report is hereby approved and confirmed.\n To that portion of this decree which adjudged the rate schedule, prescribed by the commission's order of July 24, 1922, confiscatory, and enjoined any attempt to enforce it, we find no reason to object, and to that extent it is affirmed. \n\n[271 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n The remaining portions of the decree must be eliminated. We think they were improvident and go materially beyond what the circumstances require. But whether or not they announce correct conclusions of law we do not decide. The matters to which they relate are left open and subject to further and future original consideration by any proper tribunal. While within his powers as the law then stood, the District Judge went very far when he entirely disregarded the views of the Circuit Judges who sat on the specifically constituted court. The statute was materially changed by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1215), and now causes like this must be finally adjudicated by a court composed of three judges. To such a court we think the questions to which those portions of the decree relate ought to go before we undertake finally to pass upon them.\n The approved portion of the decree will protect the company against immediate danger of serious injury, and if hereafter its rights are threatened by further unlawful interference, application for relief may be made to the proper specially constituted District Court.\n With the indicated modifications the decree below is affirmed. All costs will be charged against the appellants.\n Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE'S NATURAL GAS CO. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION(1926)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 550, 551]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George B. Gordon, Wm. Watson Smith, Arthur E. Young, and S. G. Nolin, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. F. M. Hunter, of Harrisburg, Pa., for defendant in error Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania.\n Mr. J. E. B. Cunningham, of Harrisburg, Pa., for defendant in error city of Johnstown.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases are practically but one. The matter in controversy is the constitutional validity of an order of the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania requiring the People's Natural Gas Company to continue its prior practice of supplying natural gas to another company at Johnstown for sale to consumers in that city. On successive appeals to the Superior Court and the Supreme Court of the state the People's Company challenged the order as directly regulating and burdening interstate commerce and depriving the company of property without \n\n[270 U.S. 550, 552]\n\u00a0\n due process of law in violation of constitutional restraints on state action; but both contentions were overruled and the order was sustained. 79 Pa. Super. Ct. 560; 123 A. ,799, 279 Pa. 252. On these writs of error the company relies only on the contention that the order is a forbidden interference with interstate commerce.\n The People's Company is a public service corporation created under the laws of Pennsylvania, and engaged in producing, purchasing, transporting by pipe line, and selling natural gas. It purchases about two- thirds of the gas which it transports and sells from a producing company in West Virginia having pipe lines leading from wells in that state to the boundary between the two states, and it produces the other one-third from its own wells in the southwestern counties of Pennsylvania. It has a system of pipe lines in Pennsylvania, which is connected at the state boundary with the lines of the West Virginia company, and leads thence to Pittsburgh, Johnstown, and other Pennsylvania cities and boroughs, where it sells the gas. The gas coming from West Virginia is transported, through the pipe lines as connected at the state boundary, in a continuous stream from the places of production in one state to those of consumption in the other. At the state boundary that gas passes through a registering meter, and that point is treated as the place of delivery to the People's Company; but the transportation is not interrupted there. The gas from the company's wells in Pennsylvania is fed into the moving stream at different points after it crosses the state boundary. The movement of the stream towards the points of destination is accelerated by means of pumps in Pennsylvania-one near the state line and one remote from it.\n The People's Company sells directly to consumers at the several places of consumption. other than Johnstown, and there it sells to an independent company, having a local franchise and distributing plant, which sells to con- \n\n[270 U.S. 550, 553]\n\u00a0\n sumers. For upwards of 10 years the gas sold to that company was supplied under a contract, but when the order in question was made the People's Company had exercised a reserved privilege of terminating the contract; and the commission, in making the order, proceeded on the theory that the People's Company is a public service corporation, and may be required, irrespective of the terms of the contract, to continue supplying gas to the local company, and thus to continue its indirect service to Johnstown consumers. The order does not fix the rate for this service, but contemplates that it shall be fixed primarily by a schedule to be filed by the People's Company and shall be subject to supervision by the commission as respects its reasonableness.\n In the state courts the cases had many features which are immaterial here and need not be noticed.\n The Supreme Court of the state, in overruling the contention that the order is a forbidden interference with interstate commerce, put its decision on two grounds: First, that no interstate commerce is involved; and, secondly, that if such commerce is involved the order is not a forbidden interference, but an admissible exertion of power, which exists in the state in the absence of regulation by Congress under its paramount power. The first ground of decision was based on two conclusions: One that, as the West Virginia gas is delivered at the state boundary and the title passes there, interstate commerce therein ends at that boundary and the further transportation and sale in Pannsylvania are in intrastate commerce; and the other that the gas produced in Pennsylvania and there fed into the pipe lines is more than sufficient to enable the company to comply with the order, and that when the order is construed in the light of this situation it does not require that any West Virginia gas be used in complying with it. Both conclusions are earnestly challenged by the People's Company-the former as de \n\n[270 U.S. 550, 554]\n\u00a0\n parting from the decisions of this court respecting the nature of transactions is natural gas transported from one state to another, and the other as without an adequate basis in the evidence and treating the Pennsylvania gas, after it is unavoidably commingled with that from West Virginia, as being separable and having a distinct status.\n As respects the West Virginia gas, we are of opinion, in view of its continuous transportation from the places of production in one state to those of consumption in the other, and its prompt delivery to purchasers when it reaches the intended destinations, that it must be held to be in interstate commerce throughout these transactions. Prior decisions leave no room for discussion on this point and show that the passing of custody and title at the state boundary without arresting the movement to the destinations intended are minor details which do not affect the essential nature of the business.

Feeding it into the same pipe lines with the West Virginia gas works no change in this regard. Of course, after the commingling, the two are undistinguishable But the proportions of both in the mixture are known, and that of either readily may be withdrawn without affecting the transportation or sale of the rest. So for all practical pur- \n\n[270 U.S. 550, 555]\n\u00a0\n poses the two are separable, and neither affects the character of the business as to the other. Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, 42 S.

United Fuel Gas Co., 43 S. Ct. 416, \n261 U.S. 398\n. The Supreme Court of the state has found that more than enough Pennsylvania gas goes into the mixture to meet the requirements of the order, and on this basis has construed the order as leaving the company free to deal in usual course with so much of the mixture as represents the gas from West Virginia. We think the finding has ample support in the evidence, and we accept, of course, that court's construction of the order. In these circumstances the conclusion is unavoidable, we think, that the order does not interfere with or affect the interstate commerce in which the company is engaged.\n Whether the order, if it did apply to gas in such commerce, could be sustained, becomes immaterial, in view of the conclusion just stated, and therefore need not be considered.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORT GARDNER INV. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 173\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Duane R. Dills, of New York City, and Loren Grinstead, of Seattle, Wash., for Port Gardner Inv. Co.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[272 U.S. 564, 565]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding, commenced in the federal court for Western Washington, Northern division, under Revised Statutes of the United States ,  3450 (Comp. St.  6352), to forfeit an automobile on the ground that it was being used with intent to defraud the United States of the tax on distilled spirits found therein. The use alleged was in removal and for the deposit and concealment. The claimant intervened in the District Court, asserted title to the automobile and denied knowledge or notice, prior to the seizure, that the automobile was being used or was to be used in any illegal manner. The case comes here on certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, that court having heard the case on writ of error to the District Court, which had entered a decree of forfeiture. Six questions are presented by the certificate. The fifth is:\n'Did the prosecution of the driver of the car under the National Prohibition Act constitute an election by the government to proceed under section 26 of that act and thereby prevent the forfeiture of the car under section 3450 of the Revised Statutes of the United States?'\n\n The facts are these. Neadeau, the driver of the automobile seized by prohibition agents, had been charged with possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act. He pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to pay a fine. The claimant insisted that this proceeding under section 3450 would not lie. In addition to the objections considered in United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this day, the claimant contended that the government should not prevail, because the plea of guilt followed by the sentence constitutes a prior conviction under section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act (Comp. St.  10138 4\/5 c), which provides that 'if any act is a violation of' any tax law concerning intoxicating \n\n[272 U.S. 564, 566]\n\u00a0\n liquors and also of the National Prohibition Law, or the supplement thereto, 'a conviction for such act or offense under one shall be a bar to prosecution therefor under the other.' The argument is that under section 26 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 mm) no separate action is taken to forfeit the vehicle; that forfeiture is an incident of the conviction of the person, which operates as a forfeiture also of the vehicle taken possession of, subject only to the right of the innocent third party to establish his lien or other interest; and that the order of sale is merely a step in the execution of the judgment of conviction and forfeiture. It is argued, further, that the term 'act,' as used in section 5, means transaction, and that for this reason, independently of the doctrine of election, a conviction of the person under section 26 will bar the proceeding under section 3450, because, on the facts recited in the certificate, the proceeding to forfeit under section 3450 rests upon the same transaction for which Neadeau was sentenced. Whether the principle embodied in this contention is sound we need not determine. For there is another ground on which the conviction of Neadeau under section 26 bars a proceeding to forfeit under section 3450\n\n\n The disposition of the automobile prescribed in section 26 became mandatory after Neadeau's conviction, and, being inconsistent with the disposition under section 3450, necessarily precluded resort to proceedings under the latter section. Construing the fifth question as referring to the prosecution with effect, we answer the question in the affirmative.\n We need not determine whether the mere commencement of a proceeding under section 26 constitutes an election. Nor need we give specific answers to the other questions asked, since the certificate does not disclose any reason why the sale of the automobile, subject to the interests of innocent parties, should not have been ordered by the District Court after the conviction of Neadeau.\n Yes, to question 5. \n\n[272 U.S. 564, 567]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (concurring).\n I agree that the answer to question 5 should be in the affirmative.\n In the opinion it is said, 'Construing the fifth question as referring to the prosecution with effect, we answer the question in the affirmative.' This means prosecution and conviction of the driver constitute an election to proceed against the vehicle under section 26, and prevents forfeiture under section 3450. The answer is enough to guide the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case. But it leaves open the question which is not decided in No. 115. \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 71 L. Ed. -. The substance of that question is whether the prohibition officer, discovering one in the act of transportation, may disregard the plain and direct commands of section 26 to proceed against the vehicle as there directed. I think he has no more right to ignore that command than he has to let the liquor and offender go. The law makes the election. I regret that this court's answer is so qualified and restricted. Section 26 is not so restrained.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice STONE concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRICE v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 454\nArgued: November 23, 1925Decided: January 11, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 492, 493]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Godfrey Goldmark, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 492, 495]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Jerome Michael and Henry Gale, both of New York City, for the United States.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 492, 498]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 2, 1923, Charles H. Mears, a simple contract creditor, brought suit on behalf of himself and other creditors against J. M. Gidding & Co., a New York corporation. Among the facts alleged in the complaint are these. Defendant was engaged in the business of importing and selling wearing apparel at retail in New York and four other cities. It owed plaintiff $10,000 on a promissory note; its debts were large, and it was without money to pay those then due and shortly to become due. \n\n[269 U.S. 492, 499]\n\u00a0\n If its assets could be sold in the usual course of business they would be in excess of its debts. Some of the creditors were pressing their claims, and others had commenced suit; and, if the assets were not taken into judicial custody, some creditors might obtain inequitable preferences as against plaintiff and other creditors; and the assets might not be enough to pay all. And, averring no adequate remedy at law, the complaint prayed the court to determine the rights of all creditors, and to appoint a receiver to take possession and control of all defendant's assets, and that, when just and proper, the assets be ordered sold and the proceeds distributed to those entitled thereto. On the same day, defendant filed its answer admitting the allegations and joining in the prayer of the complaint. The court immediately entered its decree granting the relief prayed, and appointed appellant temporary receiver with authority to take possession and control of, and to make disbursements to preserve, the assets. January 9, 1924, the court appointed appellant permanent receiver. Thereupon the assets were found insufficient to pay all the claims; general creditors will not receive more than 40 per cent.\n The United States filed proof of claims for income taxes for the year 1920, and for unpaid customs duties. A special master sustained the claim of the United States to priority, and fixed the amount of the income tax at $11,331.07, and the amount of the duties at $1,086.70. The District Court directed appellant, out of the assets of defendant, to pay these amounts as priority claims. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree on the authority of Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Johnson Shipyards Corporation, 6 F.(2d) 752. The case is here on writ of certiorari. Section 240, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217).\n The word 'debts,' as used in R. S.  3466 (Comp. St.  6372), includes taxes.\n The claim of the United States does not rest upon any sovereign prerogative; but the priority statutes were \n\n[269 U.S. 492, 500]\n\u00a0\n enacted to advance the same public policy which governs in the cases of royal prerogative; that is, to secure adequate public revenue to sustain the public burdens. United States v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, 35. And to that end section 3466 is to be construed liberally. Its purpose is not to be defeated by unnecessarily restricting the application of the word 'debts' within a narrow or technical meaning. Cf. Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 45 S. Ct. 73. The meaning property to be attributed to that word depends upon the connection in which it is used in the particular statute and the purpose to be accomplished.\n In the absence of another remedy made exclusive, an action of debt lies to recover taxes where the amount due is certain or readily may be made certain. United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 \nU.S. 250, 262\n, 31 S. Ct. 155; Savings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239; Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 542; Meredith v. United States, 13 Pet. 486, 493; United States v. Washington Mills, 2 Cliff. 601, 607, Fed. Cas. No. 16,647; United States v. Pacific Railroad, 4 Dill. 66, Fed. Cas. No. 15,983.\n Section 3466 of the Revised Statutes is derived from early statutes enacted for the collection of taxes. \n1\n The act of 1789 permitted bonds to be given for payment of \n\n[269 U.S. 492, 501]\n\u00a0\n customs duties, and provided that in case of default the collector should prosecute suits for recovery, and that in all cases of insolvency, or where any estate in the hands of executors or administrators should be insufficient to pay all the debts of the deceased, the debt due to the United States on any such bonds should be first satisfied. The act of 1790 superseded the earlier act, but retained the same priority provision. The act of 1792 gave to sureties the right of subrogation (see R. S.  3468 ( Comp. St.  6374)), and it limited priority to cases in which insolvency should be manifested in one of the modes stated. Prior to the passage of the act of 1797, an internal revenue had been established and extensive transactions had taken place, in the course of which many persons had become indebted to the United States. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 392. Up to that time, the priority applied only to cases of default on customs bonds. By that act, it was extended to cases involving 'any revenue officer or other person hereafter becoming indebted to the United States by bond or otherwise.' The act of 1799 introduced the provision making every executor, administrator, assignee or other person answerable for failure to pay the United States first. See R. S.  3467 ( Comp. St.  6373). The revision did not involve any substantial change of phraseology and did not work any change in the purpose or meaning of the priority acts. Buck Stove Co. v. Vickers, \n226 \nU.S. 205, 213\n, 33 S. Ct. 41. There is no reason for any distinction in respect of priority between taxes and other amounts owing to the United States. Indeed, it would be quite without reason to deny priority in case of claims for taxes due from taxpayers, and to give priority to claims against revenue officers and others on account of taxes collected by them.\n Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, and Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 472\n, are sometimes cited, and expressions found in the opinions are quoted, to show that taxes are not debts. But when regard is had to the questions \n\n[269 U.S. 492, 502]\n\u00a0\n decided in these cases, it is clear that they do not sustain the view that, as used in section 3466, the word 'debts' does not include taxes due the United States. The question in Lane County v. Oregon was whether, under the acts of Congress making United States notes 'legal tender in payment of all debts,' the state was bound to accept such notes in payment of taxes required by its own laws to be paid in gold and silver coin. The court held that the acts had no reference to taxes imposed by state authority. There were two clauses which were intended to give currency to the notes. In one of them, taxes were plainly distinguished from debts; and it was held that the word 'debts' in the other was not intended to include taxes. In Meriwether v. Garrett, it was held that taxes levied before the repeal of a city charter-other than those levied under lawful contract or judicial direction-could not be continued in force by the court after the repeal of the charter; that they had none of the elements of property and could not be seized by judicial process, and could only be collected under authority from the Legislature.\n Defendant made a voluntary assignment of its property within the meaning of section 3466\n\n\n By answering and joining in the prayer of the complaint, defendant co- operated with the plaintiff to secure the appointment of a receiver to whom it immediately handed over possession and control of all its property and business. While in effect the complaint alleged that defendant was solvent, the facts set forth indicate that it was in a failing condition. And it was found to be insolvent within a short time after the appointment of the receiver. When the assets turned out to be less than the debts, the creditors were entitled to have them dealt with as a trust fund and distributed among them according to their rights and priorities. Under the statute, claims of the United States must first be satisfied. Bramwell v. \n\n[269 U.S. 492, 503]\n\u00a0\n United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n269 \nU.S. 483\n, 46 S.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 258\nArgued: November 18, 1925Decided: January 4, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Samuel P. Goldman, and William F. Unger, all of New York City, for appellants.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants are copartners engaged in business as stockbrokers with membership in the New York Stock Exchange. They brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover, as an illegally exacted tax, the cost of internal revenue stamps affixed by them in the period from 1917 to 1920 to 'tickets' which were documentary evidence of transactions commonly known in the stockbrokerage business as the 'loan' of shares of stock and the return by the borrower to the lender of shares of stock 'borrowed.' The case was tried upon agreed facts embodied in the findings of the court below, and from the judgment for the defendant in that court the case was brought here on appeal. Judicial Code,  242 (Comp. St. 1219), before amendment of 1925 (43 Stat. 941).\n\n\n[269 U.S. 443, 450]\n\u00a0\n The applicable provisions of the statutes are to be found in War Revenue Act of 1917, title 8, schedule A, par. 4, 40 Stat. 300, 322 (Comp. St. 1918,  6318h), which is printed in the margin,1 and in the similar provision of the Revenue Act of 1918, title 11, schedule A, par. 4, 40 Stat. 1057, 1135 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6318p), which may, for the purposes of this case, be taken to be a re-enactment of the 1917 provision. Both acts imposed a stamp tax of 2 cents per share upon 'all sales or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales or deliveries of, or transfers of legal title to shares or certificates of stock.' The question presented is whether the transfers of shares of corporate stock involved in the 'loan' and 'return' transactions in accordance with the rules and practice of the Stock Exchange, are taxable transfers within the meaning of the statute.\n The loan of stock is usually, though not necessarily, incidental to a 'short sale.' As the phrase indicates, a short sale is a contract for the sale of shares which the \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 451]\n\u00a0\n seller does not own or the certificates for which are not within his control so as to be available for delivery at the time when, under the rules of the Exchange, delivery must be made. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, applicable so far as the facts of this case are concerned, a broker who sells stock is required to make delivery of the certificates on the next business day. If he does not have them available, he must procure them for the purpose of making delivery. This he may do by purchasing or borrowing the required shares, delivery of the certificates to be made to the broker to whom he has already contracted to sell.\n If he borrows them, he deposits with the lending broker their full market price; and until the loan is returned, this deposit is maintained, by means of daily payments back and forth between the borrower and the lender, at the varying level of the market value of the shares loaned. \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 452]\n\u00a0\n The lender, who thus receives in money the full market value of the shares- much more than he would ordinarily realize by pledging them-usually pays interest on the money so received, at the current rate for demand loans. But the rate of interest is a matter of negotiation and agreement, and the deposit may, on occasion, carry no interest, or the borrower of the stock may pay a premium when the stock is greatly in demand.\n During the continuance of the loan the borrowing broker is found by the loan contract to give the lender all the benefits and the lender is bound to assume all the burdens incident to ownership of the stock which is the subject of the transaction, as though the lender had retained the stock. The borrower must accordingly credit the lender with the amount of any dividends paid upon the stock while the loan continues and the lender must assume or pay to the borrower the amount of any assessments upon the stock. The lender of the stock, concurrently with the receipt of the deposit, delivers to the borrower the certificates of the stock lent, and the transaction is evidenced by a 'loan ticket,' to which the broker lending the stock affixes the revenue stamps here in question. The stock thus borrowed then becomes available for delivery on the short sale.\n The original short sale is thus completed and there remains only the obligation of the borrowing broker, terminable on demand, either by the borrower of the lender, to return the stock borrowed on repayment to him of his cash deposit, and the obligation of the lender to repay the deposit, with interest as agreed. The stock for this purpose, if not provided by the customer, must be obtained by borrowing stock of like kind and amount from other brokers, or by purchasing the stock in the open market and charging the customer, for whose account the sale was originally made, with the purchase price. In that case the short sale transaction and the borrowing \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 453]\n\u00a0\n transaction as well are brought to their conclusion by the actual purchase of stock of which the customer was short at the time when the sale was made and the delivery of the stock, thus purchased, to the lender. \n2\n The return transaction in every case is evidenced by a 'borrowed stock return ticket' to which the borrowing broker affixes the revenue stamps. The claim of the appellants comprises the cost of stamps purchased by them and affixed to loan tickets or to borrowed stock return tickets pursuant to Treasury regulations.\n It will be observed that the completed short sale transaction usually involves four separate steps in each of which there is either a sale or a complete transfer of all the legal elements of ownership. These are (1) the sale of the stock by the person effecting the short sale, followed by the transfer and delivery of the certificates for the borrowed stock to the purchaser's broker; (2) the transfer of the shares from the lender to the borrower, who uses them for delivery on the customer's short sale; (3) the purchase by the borrowing broker of the stock required to repay the loan; and (4) the transfer and delivery by the borrower to the lender of the certificates for the purchased shares to replace the shares borrowed. Each transfer may be accompanied by a physical delivery of certificates of the stock transferred; but the intermediate deliveries in (2) and (3) are usually eliminated by use of the Stock Exchange Clearing House.\n It is conceded that the first and third transactions are taxable as 'sales' or 'agreements to sell' within the \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 454]\n\u00a0\n meaning of the statute; but it is contended that the second and fourth are not subject to the tax, because they involve neither a transfer of the legal title to the stock loaned and returned, nor 'deliveries' of the shares or certificates representing them within the meaning of the acts of 1917 and 1918, and that taking into account the history and purposes of the two statutes, it was not intended to include these transactions among the taxable transfers described.\n On the argument it was also earnestly urged that the lender of stock is in a position analogous to that of a pledgor of the stock which he lends; that in consequence there is no transfer of title to the stock within the meaning of the taxing provisions of the two acts, and that in any event the lender is in the position of a borrower of money and the transaction falls within the proviso of the acts exempting from the tax deposits of stock certificates as collateral security for money loaned.\n These arguments ignore the essential legal characteristics of the loan transaction. It may be agreed for the purpose of this discussion, as was argued at the bar, that it is the law of many jurisdictions, including New York, where these transactions occurred, that the relation of the customer and the broker with whom the customer deposits stock as security for advances, or who purchases securities for account of the customer, is technically that of pledgor and pledgee, with authority and power on the part of the broker to repledge to the extent of his advances. See Richardson v. Shaw, \n209 \nU.S. 365, 374\n, 28 S. Ct. 512, 14 Ann. Cas. 981; Gorman v. Littlefield, \n229 \nU.S. 19\n, 33 S. Ct. 690; Duel v. Hollins, \n241 \nU.S. 523\n, 36 S. Ct. 615; Skiff v.

Y. 153, 24 N. E. 287. But that view of their legal relationship finds support in the agreement between the customer and the broker which contemplates, as the law requires, that the \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 455]\n\u00a0\n broker should at all times have on hand specific securities for delivery to the customer on payment of the amount of the broker's advances for the customer's account. Although the broker has an implied authority to substitute other securities of the same kind and amount for the securities which he holds for his customer, and to repledge them to the extent of his advances, courts have not dispensed with the requirement that he should at least have, either in his own prossession or lodged with his bank on the repledge, specific securities of the kind and amount purchased for his customer, available for delivery to the customer on payment of the balance due.

Cas. 1917A, 429. For breach of this duty he is liable, under the law of New York, for conversion ( Markham v. jaudon, supra; Lawrence v. Maxwell, supra; Taussig v. Hart, supra; Mayer v. Monzo, 221 N. Y. 442, 117 N. E. 948), and guilty of a criminal offense (Penal Law N. Y. (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 40)  956).\n But the borrower of stock holds nothing for account of the lender. The procedure adopted and the obligations incurred in effecting a loan of stock and its delivery upon a short sale neither contemplate nor admit of the retention by either the borrower or the lender of any of the incidents of ownership in the stock loaned. The seller, having contracted to sell securities which he does not own, is under the necessity of acquiring dominion over stock of the kind and amount which he has sold, with unrestricted power of disposition of it in order that he may fulfill his contract. Whether his broker acquires the stock by purchase or by giving to the lender of it the market value of the stock plus his personal obligation to acquire and return to the lender, on demand, a like kind and amount of stock, the legal effect of the transfer is the same. Upon the physical delivery of the certificates of \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 456]\n\u00a0\n stock by the lender, with the full recognition of the right and authority of the borrower to appropriate them to his short sale contract, and their receipt by the purchaser, all the incidents of ownership in the stock pass to him.\n When the transaction is thus completed, neither the lender nor the borrower retains any interest in the stock which is the subject-matter of the transaction and which has passed to and become the property of the purchaser. Neither the borrower nor the lender has the status of a stockholder of the corporation whose stock was dealt in, nor any legal relationship to it. Unlike the pledgee of stock who must have specific stock available for the pledgor on payment of his loan, the borrower of stock has no interest in the stock nor the right to demand it from any other. For that reason he can be neither a pledgee, trustee nor bailee for the lender, and he is not one 'with whom stock has been deposited as collateral security for money loaned.' For the incidents of ownership, the lender has substituted the personal obligation, wholly contractual, of the borrower to restore him, on demand, to the economic position in which he would have been, as owner of the stock, had the loan transaction not been entered into.\n When the borrower returns the borrowed stock, he acquires it by purchase or by borrowing again and in the process acquires and transfers to the lender all the incidents of legal ownership in securities which neither possessed before.\n We therefore conclude that both the loan of stock and the return of borrowed stock involve 'transfers of legal title to shares of stock' within the express terms of the statute; and while we are not called upon to define or enumerate the precise conditions which must attend the delivery of a certificate of stock, under other circumstances, to bring it within the taxing provisions of the act, we think it clear that deliveries of indorsed cer- \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 457]\n\u00a0\n tificates of stock incidental to these transfers of legal title are 'deliveries of ... shares or certificates of stock' within the language of the statute.\n It follows that the borrowing of stock and the return of borrowed stock are both subject to the tax unless there is to be found in the legislation now under consideration or in its history a purpose sufficiently definite and controlling to exclude the transactions in question from the operation of its applicable language.\n In earlier revenue legislation, the act of 1898 (30 Stat. 448, 458) and the act of 1914 (38 Stat. 745, 759), a stamp tax was imposed on 'all sales or agreements to sell or memoranda of sales or deliveries or transfers of shares or certificates of stock.' No attempt appears to have been made under these statutes to impose a tax on loans of stock or returns of borrowed stock. In March, 1915, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in response to an inquiry which incorrectly stated that the transfer involved in borrowing and returning borrowed stock 'does not represent a change of ownership' made a decision (T. D. 2182) that such transactions were not subject to the tax under the act of 1914. Neither of these acts contains the words 'or transfers of legal title to shares or certificates' which, as we have indicated, are of significance in the acts of 1917 and 1918 because precisely applicable to the transfers under consideration.\n The act of 1917 became a law on October 3, 1917. On March 23, 1918, the Attorney General rendered an opinion (31 Op. Attys. Gen. 255) that the transfers of stock involved in loans of stock and returns of borrowed stock were subject to the tax under the act. This opinion was adopted by the Treasury Department in its ruling of March 30, 1918. T. D. 2685. When the bill which became the Revenue Act of 1918 was pending, the attention of the Senate committee on finance was directed to the opinion of the Attorney General and the ruling of the Treasury Depart- \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 458]\n\u00a0\n ment, and it was urged in public hearing (September 11, 1918) to amend the bill so as to include 'mere loans of stock or the returns thereof' within the proviso exempting from the tax deposits of certificates of stock as collateral security. The recommended change was not adopted. The provision of the act of 1917 was re-enacted without substantial change and continued on the statute books until the adoption of the Revenue Act of November 23, 1921 (chapter 136, 42 Stat. 227), when the proposed change was incorporated in it (title 11, schedule A, par. 3, 42 Stat. 304 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6318p)).\n We can find in this history no substantial basis for the contention that there was a legislative adoption of any settled administrative construction of the statute adverse to the position now taken by the government. On the contrary, the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1918 without material change of the provision in question must, we think, be taken as indicating a purpose to continue in force the existing law as interpreted by the Attorney General (United States v. G. Falk & Bro., \n204 \nU.S. 143\n, 27 S. Ct. 191); and when Congress adopted in the amended law of 1921 the very suggestion made and rejected two years before, it then intended to effect a change in the law as it had previously existed (Smietanka v. First Trust & Savings Bank, \n257 \nU.S. 602\n, 42 S. Ct. 223).\n Nor are we able to find in the statute any expression of a general purpose to exclude from the application of its express language the type of transactions now under consideration. It evidenced a purpose not only to tax all sales or agreements to sell which had been previously taxed, but to extend the taxing provision to all transfers of legal title to shares or certificates whether technical sales or not. It was not suggested at the argument that other forms of transfer, not sales and not expressly excepted from the operation of the act by this proviso, such as gifts or transfers in trust for the benefit of the trans- \n\n[269 U.S. 443, 459]\n\u00a0\n ferror, were not subject to the tax; and the Department has consistently ruled that they were. See T. D. Regulations 40.\n As already indicated, the borrowing of stock and the returning of borrowed stock do not fall within the description of those classes of transactions expressly exempted from the tax. Nor do they so resemble them in a popular and nontechnical sense as to warrant their inclusion among the exceptions. Even in a loose and colloquial sense it cannot be said that the loan of stock is a 'deposit of stock certificates as collateral security for money loaned thereon.' We therefore conclude that while there is no indication of a purpose to impose a discriminatory tax upon short sales or transactions necessarily involved in short sales, there was a general purpose to tax all transfers of legal ownership of shares of stock which includes those made necessary in order to complete a short sale. It follows that they are subject to the tax imposed upon the class of transactions in which they are included.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Oct. 3, 1917, c. 63, tit. 8, schedule A, par. 4, 40 Stat. 300, 322:\n (4) 'Capital stock, sales or transfers: On all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales or deliveries of, or transfers of legal title to shares or certificates of stock in any association, company, or corporation, whether made upon or shown by the books of the association, company, or corporation, or by any assignment in blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or other evidence of transfer or sale, whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such stock or not, on each $100 of face value or fraction thereof, 2 cents, and where such shares of stock are without par value, the tax shall be 2 cents on the transfer or sale or agreement to sell on each share, unless the actual value thereof is in excess of $100 per share, in which case the tax shall be 2 cents on each $100 of actual or fraction thereof: Provided, that it is not intended by this title to impose a tax upon an agreement evidencing a deposit of stock certificates as collateral security for money loaned thereon, which stock certificates are not actually sold, nor upon such stock certificates so deposited: Provided, further, that the tax shall not be imposed upon deliveries or transfers to a broker for sale, nor upon deliveries or transfers by a broker to a customer for whom and upon whose order he has purchased same, but such deliveries or transfers shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth the facts: Provided further, that in case of sale where the evidence of transfer is shown only by the books of the company the stamp shall be placed upon such books; and where the change of ownership is by transfer of the certificate the stamp shall be placed upon the certificate; and in cases of an agreement to sell or where the transfer is by delivery of the certificate assigned in blank there shall be made and delivered by the seller to the buyer a bill or memorandum of such sale, to which the stamp shall be affixed; and every bill or memorandum of shall or agreement to sell before mentioned shall show the date thereof, the name of the seller, the amount of the sale, and the matter or thing to which it refers.

H. HASSLER, INC., v. SHAW(1926)\nNo. 278\nArgued: April 27, 1926Decided: May 10, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Martindale, of Indianapolis, Ind., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. A. S. Harby, of Sumter, S. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error upon a judgment in personam against the plaintiff in error on the ground that there never was any valid service of process against it and that therefore there was no jurisdiction in the Court. The writ was transferred from the Circuit Court of Appeals 3 F.(2d) 605 to this Court, the case being one in which the jurisdiction of the District Court and that alone was in issue within the meaning of section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), under the decisions in Shepard v. Adams, \n168 \nU.S. 618\n, 18 S. Ct. 214, Remington v. Central Pacific R. R. Co., \n198 \nU.S. 95\n, 25 S. Ct. 577, and Board of Trade v. Hammond Elevator Co., \n198 \nU.S. 424\n, 25 S. Ct. 740, and therefore not open to review in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Carlo Poma, \n255 \nU.S. 219\n, 41 S. Ct. 309.\n The suit is for an alleged breach of contract and was brought in a Court of the State of South Carolina against a corporation of Indiana. The only personal service was by delivery of copies of the summons and complaint in Indiana, on May 12, 1919, as the record shows. An attachment was levied on property alleged to belong to the defendant and within the State. The record further shows that in the same month the defendant moved to set aside the service, and that the motion was refused, without prejudice to the defendant's right to set up the special defense in its answer, this being a right clearly given by the statutes of South Carolina. The case then was removed to the District Court of the United States and subsequently in September of the same year an answer was filed alleging the above-mentioned motion and order, and setting up that the Court had no jurisdiction, \n\n[271 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n because the defendant was an indiana corporation doing no business and having no property within the State upon which attachment could be levied so as to give the Court jurisdiction, and also, reserving its right to object to the jurisdiction, pleading to the merits. In March, 1921, an amended complaint was filed alleging that the defendant had property in the State and setting forth the cause of action. The defendant answered denying the jurisdiction as before and denying that it had property within the State, and saving its right to object to the jurisdiction, again answering to the merits. With regard to the attachment it is enough to say that a third party intervened, claimed the goods and finally got judgment for them. But before that happened there was a trial on the merits between the plaintiff and defendant and a verdict for the plaintiff in 1921. The motion for judgment was delayed until May 1924. In the same month the defendant moved to set aside the verdict and to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction. The judge then sitting thought that the question of jurisdiction should be left to the decision of the Appellate Court and ordered judgment. A motion to vacate the judgment was overruled on the same ground.\n Thus it is manifest that the record shows a judgment against a defendant never served with process and without any attachment of property- a judgment void upon its face unless the record discloses that the defendant came in and submitted to the jurisdiction, although not served. The record discloses no general appearance in terms, but on the contrary a continuous insistence by the defendant that it had not been brought within the power of the Court. But acts and omissions are relied upon as having the effect of a general appearance. First in order of time it is said that the petition to remove had that effect. This if true would be unjust, but the contrary is \n\n[271 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n established. General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 268\n, 269 S., 43 S. Ct. 106; Wabash Western Ry. Co. v. Brow, \n164 \nU.S. 271, 279\n, 17 S. Ct. 126. Then it is said that pleading to the merits was an appearance, notwithstanding the effort of the defendant to subordinate its denial of the cause of action to its protest against the jurisdiction and notwithstanding the statute of South Carolina, and the order in the cast purporting to save its rights. This again would be unjust but such is not the law. Harkness v. Hyde, \n98 U.S. 476\n, 479; Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 209\n, 13 S. Ct. 44. It is said that going to trial on the merits without saving an exception submitted to the jurisdiction. The plaintiff (the defendant in error) objects to out seeking any explanation in a bill of exceptions that he says was allowed too late, but the record shows that at the time of the trial the attachment was outstanding, not having been vacated until later, and that it no doubt may have been, as the bill of exceptions shows that it was, the expectation of the trial judge that the verdict would be satisfied out of the attached goods. The record showed the defendant's denial of the right to proceed, and the grounds for it. It was not necessary to reiterate the denial in a bill of exceptions, in order to get it on the record. It already was there.\n There was some suggestion that the emphasis, at least, of the answer denying jurisdiction was on the absence of the defendant from the State and its having no property there. But the answer and the amended answer elaborately set out the motion to set aside the service and the reservation of the defendant's rights by the State judge. It seems to us impossible to doubt that this was meant to save the question and that it would be hypertechnical to require a more explicit statement that the grounds of the motion as well as the other matters mentioned were still the basis on which jurisdiction was denied. The other \n\n[271 U.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n matters were added simply to give further force to the failure to serve within the State. We are of opinion that the record does not disclose an appearance by the defendant, or any submission to the jurisdiction that it sought and had a right to avoid.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAFFEL v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 307\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 494, 495]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George B. Martin, of Catlettsburg, Ky., for Raffel.\n Mr. Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, both of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Raffel, with another, was indicted and twice tried for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et seq.). Upon the first trial, a prohibition agent testified that after the search of a drinking place, Raffel admitted that the place belonged to him. On that trial Rafel did not offer himself as a witness, and the jury failed to reach a verdict. Upon the second trial the prohibition agent gave similar testimony. Raffel took the stand and denied making any such statement. After admitting that he was present at the former trial, and that the same prosecuting witness had then given the same testimony, Raffel was asked questions by the court which required him to disclose that he had not testified at the first trial, and to explain why he had not done so. The questions and answers are printed in the margin. \n1\n The second trial resulted in a conviction. On writ of error, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit certified to this \n\n[271 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n court (Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216)) a question necessary to the disposition of the case as follows:\n'Was it error to require the defendant, Raffel, offering himself as a witness upon the second trial, to disclose that he had not testified as a witness in his own behalf upon the first trial?'\n\n To this, and to the similar questions which involve, not a previous trial, but a previous preliminary examination, or a hearing upon habeas corpus or application for bail, the authorities have given conflicting answers. Cases which support the government's position are Commonwealth v. Smith, 163 Mass. 411, 40 N. E. 189, and People v. Prevost, 219 Mich. 233, 189 N. W. 92. See, also, Taylor v. Commonwealth, 34 S. W. 227, 17 Ky. Law Rep. 1214; Sanders v. State, 52 Tex. Cr. R. 156, 105 S. W. 803. Compare Garrett v. Transit Co., 219 Mo. 65, 90-95, 118 S. W. 68, 16 Ann. Cas. 678.\n Other cases take an opposite view, with perhaps less searching examination of the principles involved. See Parrott v. Commonwealth, 47 S. W. 452, 20 Ky. Law Rep. 761; Newman v. Commonwealth, 88 S. W. 1089, 28 Ky. Law Rep. 81; Smith v. State, 90 Miss. 111, 43 So. 465, 122 Am. St. Rep. 313; Parrott v. State, 125 Tenn. 1, 139 S. W. 1056, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1073, Ann.

W. 48; Garrett v. Transit Co ., supra.\n The Fifth Amendment provides that a person may not 'be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself' and by the Act of March 16, 1878, c. 37, 20 Stat. 30 (Comp. St.  1465), it is enacted:\n'That in the trial of all indictments ... against persons charged with the commission of crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors, in the United States courts ... the person so charged shall, at his own request but not otherwise, be a competent witness. And his failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.'\n\n The immunity from giving testimony is one which the defendant may waive by offering himself as a witness. \n\n[271 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n Reagan v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 301\n, 15 S. Ct. 610; Fitzpatrick v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 304\n, 20 S. Ct. 944; Powers v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 303\n, 32 S. Ct. 281; Caminetti v.

When he takes the stand in his own behalf, he does so as any other witness, and within the limits of the appropriate rules he may be cross-examined as to the facts in issue. Reagan v. United States, supra, 305 (15 S. Ct. 610); Fitzpatrick v. United States, supra; Tucker v. United States (C. C. A.) 5 F. (2d) 818. He may be examined for the purpose of impeaching his credibility. Reagan v. United States, supra, 305 (15 S. Ct. 610); Fitzpatrick v. United States, supra, 316 (20 S. Ct. 944). His failure to deny or explain evidence of incriminating circumstances of which he may have knowledge may be the basis of adverse inference, and the jury may be so instructed. Caminetti v. United States, supra. His waiver is not partial; having once cast aside the cloak of immunity, he may not resume it at will, whenever cross-examination may be inconvenient or embarrassing.\n If, therefore, the question asked of the defendant were logically relevant, and competent within the scope of the rules of cross-examination they were proper questions, unless there is some reason of policy in the law of evidence which requires their exclusion.\n We may concede, without deciding, that, if the defendant had not taken the stand on the second trial, evidence that he had claimed the same immunity on the first trial would be probative of no fact in issue, and would be inadmissible. See Maloney v. State, 91 Ark. 485, 491, 121 S. W. 728, 134 Am. St. Rep. 83, 18 Ann. Cas. 480; Loewenherz v. Merchants' Bank, 144 Ga. 556, 87 S. E. 778, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 877; Bunckley v. State, 77 Miss. 540, 27 So. 638; People v. Willett, 92 N. Y. 29; but see People v. Prevost, supra.\n Making this concession, and laying aside for the moment any question whether the defendant, notwithstanding his offering himself as a witness, retained some vestige of his immunity, we do not think the questions asked of him \n\n[271 U.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n were irrelevant or incompetent; for, if the cross-examination had revealed that the real reason for the defendant's failure to contradict the government's testimony on the first trial was a lack of faith in the truth or probability of his own story, his answers would have a bearing on his credibility and on the truth of his own testimony in chief.\n It is elementary that a witness, who upon direct examination denies making statements relevant to the issue, may be cross-examined with respect to conduct on his part inconsistent with this denial. The value of such testimony, as is always the case with cross-examination, must depend upon the nature of the answers elicited, and their weight is for the jury. But we cannot say that such questions are improper cross-examination, although the trial judge might appropriately instruct the jury that the failure of the defeendant to take the stand in his own behalf is not in itself to be taken as an admission of the truth of the testimony which he did not deny.\n There can be no basis, then, for excluding the testimony objected to, unless it be on the theory that, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, the defendant's immunity should be held to survive his appearance as a witness on the second trial, to the extent, at least, that he may be permitted to preserve silence as to his conduct on the first.\n Whether there should be such a qualification of the rule that the accused waives his privilege completely by becoming a witness must necessarily depend upon the reasons underlying the policy of the immunity, and one's view as to whether it should be extended. The only suggested basis for such a qualification is that the adoption of the rule contended for by the government might operate to bring pressure on the accused to take the stand on the first trial, for fear of the consequences of his silence in the event of a second trial, and might influence the defendant to continue his silence on the second trial, be- \n\n[271 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n cause his first silence may there be made to count against him. See People v. Prevost, supra, 247 (189 N. W. 92); 36 Harvard Law Rev. 207, 208.\n But these refinements are without real substance. We need not close our eyes to the fact that every person accused of crime is under some pressure to testify, lest the jury, despite carefully framed instructions, draw an unfavorable inference from his silence. See State v. Bartlett, 55 Me. 200, 219; State v. Cleaves, 59 Me. 298, 300, 8 Am. Rep. 422. When he does take the stand, he is under the same pressure: To testify fully, rather than avail himself of a partial immunity. And the accused at the second trial may well doubt whether the advantage lies with partial silence or with complete silence. Even if, on his first trial, he were to weigh the consequences of his failure to testify then, in the light of what might occur on a second trial, it would require delicate balances to enable him to say that the rule of partial immunity would make his burden less onerous than the rule that he may remain silent, or, at his option, testify fully, explaining his previous silence. We are unable to see that the rule that if he testifies, he must testify fully, adds in any substantial manner to the inescapable embarrassment which the accused must experience in determining whether he shall testify or not.\n The safeguards against self-incrimination are for the benefit of those who do not wish to become witnesses in their own behalf, and not for those who do. There is a sound policy in requiring the accused who offers himself as a witness to do so without reservation, as does any other witness. We can discern nothing in the policy of the law against self- incrimination which would require the extension of immunity to any trial, or to any tribunal, other than that in which the defendant preserves it by refusing to testify.\n The answer to the question certified is 'No.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Q.

St.  8657 et seq.).\n A petition of the defendant below, petitioner here, for judgment of nol. pros. on the ground that the action, having been brought more than two years after the death, was barred by the statute of limitations, was denied (26 Dauphin County (Pa.) Reports 234), and judgment was entered for plaintiff, respondent here. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the judgment was affirmed. 126 A. 381, 281 Pa. 270. This court granted certiorari. 45 S. Ct. 197, \n266 U.S. 600\n.\n As respondent brought his action more than two years after the death and less than two years after his appointment as administrator, the sole question presented for \n\n[271 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n review is whether, in an action for wrongful death brought under the federal Employers' Liability Act, the Two-year statute of limitations begins to run at the date of the death or at the date of the appointment of the administrator of the decedent.\n The federal Employers' Liability Act imposes upon common carriers by railroad, engaged in interstate commerce, liability for the death of an employee employed in such commerce, when the death results from the negligence of the carrier or its agents, and gives a right of action to the personal reppesentative of the decedent for the benefit of the surviving spouse and children of such employee, or if there are no such survivors, then for the benefit of his dependent next of kin. By section 6 of the act, it is provided:\n'That no action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued.'\n\n The application of this statute turns on the question whether the cause of action created by the act may be deemed to have 'accrued,' within the meaning of the act, at the time of death or on the appointment of the administrator, who is the only person authorized by the statute to maintain the action. American R. R. of Porto Rico v. Birch, 32 S. Ct. 603, \n224 U.S. 547\n; St. Louis, S. F. & T. Ry. v. Seale, 33 S. Ct. 651, \n229 U.S. 156\n, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 156. The question had never been directly answered by this court, although in Missouri, K. & T. Ry. v. Wulf, 33 S. Ct. 135, \n226 U.S. 570\n, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134, it was assumed that the cause of action was barred in two years after the death.\n It has received conflicting answers in the decisions of other courts. The decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in American R. R. of Porto Rico v. Coronas, 230 F. 545, 144 C. C. A. 599, L. R. A. 1916E, 1095, holding that the statute does not begin to run until the appointment of the administrator has been followed in Guinther v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. ( C. C. A.) 1 F.(2d) 85, in Kierejewski v, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. (D. C.) 280 F. 125, and in Bird v. Ft. Worth & Rio Grande \n\n[271 U.S. 58, 61]\n\u00a0\n Railway, 207 S. W. 518, 109 Tex. 323. Other cases have laid down a similar rule with respect to state laws giving a right of recovery for wrongful death. Andrews v. Hartford & New Haven R. R., 34 Conn. 57; Crapo v. City of Syracuse, 76 N. E. 465, 183 N. Y. 395.\n On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Georgia (Seaboard Air Line v. Brooks, 107 S. E. 878, 151 Ga. 625) and the Supreme Court of Kansas ( Giersch v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry., 171 P. 591, 16 A. L. R. 470) have expressly declined to follow the rule laid down in the First Circuit in American R. R. of Porto Rico v. Coronas, supra. The same result was reached in Bixler v. Pennsylvania R. R. (D. C.) 201 F. 553, and a like rule has been applied in state courts to similar state statutes. See Radezky v. Sargent & Co., 58 A. 709, 77 Conn. 110; Rodman v. Ry., 70 P. 642, 65 Kan. 645, 59 L. R. A. 704; Swisher v. Ry., 90 P. 812, 76 Kan. 97; Carden, Adm'r, v. L. & N. R. R., 39 S. W. 1027, 101 Ky. 113; Gulledge v. R. R., 60 S. E. 1134, 147 N. C. 234, 125 Am. St. Rep. 544; Hall v. R. R., 62 S. E. 899, 149 N. C. 108.\n This diversity of view arises principally from the attempt made to find in the word 'accrued,' used in the statute, some definite technical meaning which will in itself enable courts to say at what point of time the cause of action has come into existence, and consequently at what point of time the statute of limitations begins to run.\n It is argued in support of one view, as the court below held, that as the cause of action for death is the creature of statute, and is given exclusively to the administrator of the decedent, no cause of action can arise or accrue until there is an administrator. On the other hand, it is asserted with, we think, equal plausibility, that, when all of the events have occurred which determine the liability of the common carrier, the cause of action has come into existence or has 'accrued.'\n We do not think it is possible to assign to the word 'accrued' any definite technical meaning which by \n\n[271 U.S. 58, 62]\n\u00a0\n itself would enable us to say whether the statutory period begins to run at one time or the other; but the uncertainty is removed when the word is interpreted in the light of the general purposes of the statute and of its other provisions, and with due regard to those practical ends which are to be served by any limitation of the time within which an action must be brought.\n Whatever effect may be given to the assertion often made in judicial opinion that in the ordinary case where a cause of action arises in favor of the estate of a decedent there is no person who can enforce it if there is no executor or administrator,1 that statement cannot be applied strictly to causes of action for death arising under the federal Employers' Liability Act. For while it is true that the executor or administrator is the person authorized to bring the suit, he nevertheless acts only for the benefit of persons specifically designated in the statute. At the time of death there are identified persons for whose benefit the liability exists and who can start the machinery of the law in motion to enforce it, by applying for the appointment of an administrator. This court has held that a suit brought by such persons in their individual capacity is not a nullity within the provisions of the act, and that if by amendment the plaintiff is properly described as executor or administrator of the decedent, even though the amendment is had after the expiration of the statutory period, the suit may be maintained and a recovery had under the statute. See Missouri, K. & T. Ry. v. Wulf, supra. See, also, Seaboard Air Line v. Renn, 36 S. Ct. 567, \n241 U.S. 290\n, and New York C. & H. R. R. R. Co. v. Kinney, 43 S. Ct. 122, \n260 U.S. 340\n. Thus at the death of dece- \n\n[271 U.S. 58, 63]\n\u00a0\n dent there are real parties in interest who may procure the action to be brought, and there are no such practical inconveniences or necessary delays as would lead to the conclusion that the word 'accrued,' as used in the statute, cannot be taken to refer to the time of death.\n The language of the statute evidences an intention to set a definite limit to the period within which an action may be brought under it without reference to the exigencies which arise from the administration of a decedent's estate. The statute relates not only to causes of action for wrongful death but to causes of action for other injuries. Where the cause of action for personal injury survives to personal representatives of an injured employee who dies after the injury from other causes, the language of the statute seems peremptorily to require the action to be brought within two years from the time of injury, without regard to any intervening period after death when there is no executor or administrator. Compare Whipple v. Johnson, 49 S. W. 827, 66 Ark. 204; Gibson v. Ruff, 8 App. D. C. 262; Sammis v. Wightman, 12 So. 526, 31 Fla. 10; Sanford v. Sanford, 62 N. Y. 553, 555.\n It cannot be supposed that Congress, in enacting the statute intended to impose a fixed limitation of two years within which all actions for personal injury must be begun, regardless of death and of the time of appointment of an administrator of the injured employee, and at the same time intended to allow an indefinite period within which application may be made for the appointment of an administrator as the prerequisite to an action to recover for wrongful death. Indeed the limitation would seem to be more necessary in the case of personal injuries than in the case of a wrongful death; for in the former case some part of the period of limitations will have run at the time of death. This inconsistency is avoided if the word 'accrued,' whether applied to causes of action for personal injury or for wrongful death, be taken to apply \n\n[271 U.S. 58, 64]\n\u00a0\n uniformly to the time when the events have occurred which determine that the carrier is liable, even though the particular person through whose agency the liability is to be enforced has not been designated.\n It is argued that as it was provided by Lord Campbell's Act that the period of limitation should run from the time of death, the omission of that phraseology from the Employers' Liability Act indicates that it was the intention of Congress that the statutory period should run from a different time, namely, from the time of the appointment of an administrator. This argument, however, leaves out of account the fact that the present statute deals with causes of action arising from personal injury as well as causes of action arising from a wrongful death. The limitation that no action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued, applies to both. This accounts for the omission of any specific reference to death in fixing the period of limitation; and the fact that the limitation is made applicable equally to the Two causes of action, one of which admittedly 'accrues' on the happening of the events which fix the defendant's liability, leads persuasively to the conclusion that a like test was intended for determining when the cause of action accrued for wrongful death.\n Every paractical consideration which would lead to the imposition of any period of limitation, would requrie that the period should begin to run from the definitely ascertained time of death rather than the uncertain time of the appointment of an administrator. Here the appointment was not made until six years after the death. No reason appears, if the opinion of the court below is followed, why the time might not have been extended The only persons who can procure The only persons who can prudure the appointement of an administrator are ordinarily spouse, next of kin, or \n\n[271 U.S. 58, 65]\n\u00a0\n creditors of the decedent. Certainly the common carrier whoud have no standing to make the application. The very purpose of a period of limitation is that there may be, at some definitely ascertained period, an end to litigation. If the persons who are the designated beneficiaries of the right of action created may choose their own time for applying for the appointment of an administrator and consequently for setting the statute running, the two-year period of limitation so far as it applies to actions for wrongful death might as well have been omitted from the statute. An interpretation of a statute purporting to set a definite limitation upon the time of bringing action, without saving clauses, which would, nevertheless, leave defendants subject indefinitely to actions for the wrong done, would, we think, defeat its obvious purpose. There is nothing in the language of the statute to require, or indeed to support, such an interpretation.\n Judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Johnson, Adm'r, v.

C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 69, 77]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of North Carolina in a consolidation of two causes, the first being an appeal to a superior court of the state by the plaintiff in error, the Rhode Island Hospital Trust Company, executor of George Briggs, from an inheritance tax assessment on the decedent's estate made by the commissioner of revenue of North Carolina, and the second being an action at law by the executor to recover the taxes paid by it on the assessment under protest. The superior court held that the inheritance taxes imposed by the commissioner of revenue of the state were lawful and that the executor was not entitled to recover them back as illegally collected. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed this judgment. 121 S. E. 741, 187 N. C. 263.\n The assignment of error of the executor is based on the invalidity under the Fourteenth Amendment of that part of the Revenue Act of 1919 of North Carolina (Public Laws, c. 90, s 6, subsec. 7), which provides:\n'Sec. 6. From and after the passage of this act all real and personal property of whatever kind and nature which shall pass by will or by the intestate laws of this state from any person who may die seized or possessed of the same while a resident of this state, whether the person or persons dying seized thereof be domiciled within or out of the state (or if the decedent was not a resident of this state at the time of his death, such property or any part thereof within this state), or any interest therein or income therefrom which shall be transferred by deed, grant, \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 78]\n\u00a0\n sale, or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, bargainor, donor, or assignor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after such death, to any person or persons or to bodies corporate or politic, in trust or otherwise, or by reason whereof any person or body corporate or politic shall become beneficially entitled in possession or expectancy to any property or the income thereof, shall be and hereby is made subject to a tax for the benefit of the state. ...\n\n'Seventh. The words 'such property or any part thereof or interest therein within this state' shall include in its meaning bonds and shares of stock in any incorporated company, incorporated in any other state or country, when such incorporated company is the owner of property in this state, and if 50 per cent. or more of its property is located in this state, and when bonds or shares of stock in any such company not incorporated in this state, and owning property in this state, are transferred by inheritance, the valuation upon which the tax shall be computed shall be the proportion of the total value of such bonds or shares which the property owned by such company in this state bears to the total property owned by such company, and the exemptions allowed shall be the proportion of exemptions allowed by this act, as related to the total value of the property of the decedent.'\n\n The seventh subsection further provides:\n'Any incorporated company not incorporated in this state and owning property in this state which shall transfer on its books the bonds or shares of stock of any decedent holder of shares of stock in such company exceeding in par value $500, before the inheritance tax, if any, has been paid, shall become liable for the payment of the said tax, and any property held by such company in this state shall be subject to execution to satisfy same. A receipt or waiver signed by the state tax commission of North Carolina shall be full protection for any such company in the transfer of any such stock or bonds.' \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 79]\n\u00a0\n George Briggs was a resident of the state of Rhode Island, and domiciled therein at the time of his death. He never resided in North Carolina. He died testate October 29, 1919, leaving a large estate. The plaintiff, Rhode Island Hospital Trust Company, was appointed executor of Briggs' will, and qualified as such before the municipal court of the city of Providence, R. I. Among other personal property passing to the executor under the will were shares of stock in the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which with declared dividends unpaid were valued at $115,634.50. The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, hereinafter for brevity called the Tobacco Company, is a corporation created under the laws of the state of New Jersey. Section 1181 of the Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina provides that every foreign corporation, before being permitted to do business in North Carolina, shall file in the office of the secretary of state a copy of its charter, a statement of the amount of its capital stock, the amount actually issued, the principal office in North Carolina, the name of the agent in charge of the office, the character of the business which it transacts, and the name and post office addresses of its officers and directors. It is required to pay, for the use of the state, 29 cents for every $1,000 of its authorized capital stock, but in no case less than $25, nor more than $250. It may withdraw from the state upon paying a fee of $5, and filing in the office of the secretary of state a statement of its wish to do so. In August, 1906, the Tobacco Company filed its application under the statute and complied with the requirements, and a certificate granting authority to it to do business in the state was issued. Two-thirds in value of its entire property is in North Carolina. Since 1906, it has regularly paid the license and franchise tax required, and is still doing business in the state.\n\n Briggs' certificates of stock in the Tobacco Company, passing under his will to his executor, were, none of them, \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 80]\n\u00a0\n in the state of North Carolina at the time of his death, and never had been while they were owned by him. The commissioner of revenue of the state assessed an inheritance tax upon $77,089.67, 66 2\/3 per cent. of the total value of Briggs' stock, amounting to $2,658.85. The plaintiff, as executor, applied to the office of the company in New Jersey to have this stock transferred to it as executor, in compliance with the will of Briggs. The company refused to do so, on the ground that under the law of North Carolina, already set forth, it would, by such transfer before the executor paid the transfer tax, subject itself to a penalty which could be exacted out of its property in that state. Thereupon the executor paid the tax under protest, and brought suit to recover it back.\n The question here presented is whether North Carolina can validly impose a transfer or inheritance tax upon shares of stock owned by a nonresident in a business corporation of New Jersey, because the corporation does business and has two-thirds of its property within the limits of North Carolina. We think that the law of North Carolina, by which this is attempted, is invalid. It goes without saying that a state may not tax property which is not within its territorial jurisdiction.

Ct. 669, \n198 U.S. 341\n; Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 26 S. Ct. 36, \n199 U.S. 194\n, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. New York, 27 S.

Cas. 1918C, 617; Frick v. Pennsylvania, 45 S. Ct. 603, \n268 U.S. 473\n, 488\n\n\n The tax here is not upon property, but upon the right of succession to property; but the principle that the subject to be taxed must be within the jurisdiction of the state applies as well in the case of a transfer tax as in that of a property tax. A state has no power to tax the devo- \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 81]\n\u00a0\n lution of the property of a nonresident, unless it has jurisdiction of the property devolved or transferred. In the matter of intangibles, like choses in action, shares of stock, and bonds, the situs of which is with the owner, a transfer tax, of course, may be properly levied by the state in which he resides. So, too, it is well established that the state in which a corporation is organized may provide, in creating it, for the taxation in that state of all its shares, whether owned by residents or nonresidents. Hawley v. Malden, 34 S. Ct. 201, \n232 U.S. 1\n, 12, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 30 S. Ct. 326, \n216 \nU.S. 285, 293\n, 294 S.; Corry v. Baltimore, 25 S. Ct. 297, \n196 U.S. 466\n; Tappan v. Bank, 19 Wall. 490, 503.\n In this case the jurisdiction of North Carolina rests on the claim that because the New Jersey corporation has two-thirds of its property in North Carolina, the state may treat shares of its stock as having a situs in North Carolina to the extent of the ratio in value of its property in North Carolina to all of its property. This is on the theory that the stockholder is the owner of the property of the corporation, and the state which has jurisdiction of any of the corporate property has pro tanto jurisdiction of his shares of stock. We cannot concur in this view. The owner of the shares of stock in a company is not the owner of the corporation's property. He has a right to his share in the earnings of the corporation, as they may be declared in dividends, arising from the use of all its property. In the dissolution of the corporation he may take his proportionate share in what is left, after all the debts of the corporation have been paid and the assets are divided in accordance with the law of its creation. But he does not own the corporate property.\n In Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583, the question was whether shares of stock in a national bank could be subjected to state taxation if part or all of the capital of the bank was invested in securities of the national \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 82]\n\u00a0\n government declared by the statute authorizing them to be exempt from taxation by state authority. It was held that they could be so taxed. Mr. Justice Nelson, speaking for this court, said, at page 583:\n'But, in addition to this view, the tax on the shares is not a tax on the capital of the bank. The corporation is the legal owner of all the property of the bank, real and personal; and within the powers conferred upon it by the charter, and for the purposes for which it was created, can deal with the corporate property as absolutely as a private individual can deal with his own. This is familiar law, and will be found in every work that may be opened on the subject of corporations. ...\n\n'The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the net profits earned by the bank in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares; and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This a distinct independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property that may belong to him.'\n\n The same principle is declared in Jellenik v. Huron Copper Co., 20 S. Ct. 559, \n177 U.S. 1\n, in which it was held that shares of stock in a corporation had a situs in the state creating the corporation so that they were there subject to mesne process. It is approved in Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 686, in Hawley v. Malden, supra, at page 19 (34 S. Ct. 201), in Eisner v. Macomber, 40 S. Ct. 189, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 208\n, 213 S., 214, 9 A. L. R. 1570, and in Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Fairweather, Mayor, 44 S. Ct. 23, \n263 U.S. 103\n, 112.\n In North Carolina and in some other states, the state Constitution requires all property, real and personal, to be taxed equally. Laws have been passed exempting shares of stock in North Carolina corporations from taxation, on the ground that the property of the corporation is taxed which is held to be equivalent to taxing the shares. \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 83]\n\u00a0\n Person v. Watts, 115 S. E. 336, 184 N. C. 499; Jones v. Davis, 35 Ohio St. 474. But such cases grow out of state constitutional difficulties and are hardly applicable to questions of state jurisdiction of shares of foreign corporation stock. The cases of Bronson's Estate, 44 N. E. 707, 150 N. Y. 1, 8, 34 L. R. A. 238, 55 Am. St. Rep. 632, and In re Culver's Estate, 123 N. W. 743, 145 Iowa, 1, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 384, said to hold that a stockholder owns the property of the corporation, are really authorities to the point that shares of stock in a corporation of a state have their situs for purposes of taxation in that state, as well as in the residence of the owner of the shares. But whatever the view of the other courts, that of this court is clear; the stockholder does not own the corporate property. Jurisdiction for tax purposes over his shares cannot, therefore, be made to rest on the situs of part of the corporate property within the taxing state. North Carolina cannot control the devolution of New Jersey shares. That is determined by the laws of Rhode Island where the decedent owner lived or by those of New Jersey, because the shares have a situs in the state of incorporation. There is nothing in the statutory conditions on which the Tobacco Company began or continued business in North Carolina which suggests that its shareholders subjected their stock to the taxing jurisdiction of that state by the company's doing business there.\n Our conclusion is in accord with the great majority of cases in the state courts where this exact question has arisen. Welch v. Burrill, 111 N. E. 774, 223 Mass. 87; People v. Dennett, 114 N. E. 493, 276 Ill. 43; State v. Dunlap, 156 P. 1141, 28 Idaho, 784, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 546; State v. Walker, 226 P. 894, 70 Mont. 484; In re Harkness' Estate, 204 P. 911, 83 Okl. 107. Tyler v. Dane County, 289, Fed. 843, contains a full and satisfactory discussion of the subject in a Wisconsin case which has been followed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in Estate of Shepard, 197 N. W. 344, 184 Wis. 88. See article by Professor Beale, 38 Harvard Law Review, 291.\n In an addendum to its opinion in this case, the Supreme Court of North Carolina suggests that the jurisdiction of the state to tax the shares of the New Jersey corporation \n\n[270 U.S. 69, 84]\n\u00a0\n may be based on the view that the corporation has been domesticated in North Carolina. So far as the statutes of the state show, it has been authorized to do and does business in the state and owns property therein and pays a fee for the permission to do so. It has not been re- incorporated in the state. It is still a foreign corporation and the rights of its stockholders are to be determined accordingly.\n We conclude that the statute of North Carolina, above set out, in so far as it attempts to subject the shares of stock in the New Jersey corporation, held by a resident of Rhode Island, to a transfer tax deprives the executor of Briggs of his property without due process of law and is invalid.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRISTY v.

In each it was alleged that an amount in excess of the jurisdictional requirement was in controversy, and in each it was alleged that proceedings purporting to be had under the South Dakota drainage statutes, with respect to the lands of the appellees, were unauthorized and void, and that those statutes and proceedings denied to appellees due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. The suits were tried together and a decree was given for the plaintiffs by the District Court. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Risty, 282 F. 364. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, on appeal, affirmed the decree (Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 297 F. 710), and the cases are brought here on appeal (Judicial Code, ss 128, 241 (Comp. St. ss 1120, 1218), before Act of February 13, 1925; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., 37 S. Ct. 673, \n244 U.S. 499\n, 508, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88). Petition for certiorari was denied, 45 S. Ct. 122, \n266 U.S. 622\n.\n The two courts below agree as to all material facts. We accordingly consider them here only so far as is needful to pass on questions of law. United States v. State Investment Co., 44 S. Ct. 289, \n264 U.S. 206\n, 211.\n In 1907 the board of county commissioners of Minnehaha county, acting under the Constitution and laws of the state, established 'drainage ditch No. 1,' extending from a point north of the city of Sioux Falls, thence south, and then to the east of Sioux Falls, 3 miles in all, to the Big Sioux River, into which it emptied. From the main ditch, a spur ditch was extended northwest to a point near the Big Sioux River, which from that point passes to the southwest and thence flows east, forming a loop about the principal part of the city of Sioux Falls, and finally flows through the city on its easterly side in a northeasterly direction. \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n In 1910 the board of county commissioners established drainage ditch No. 2, extending northerly from the north terminus of ditch No. 1 for a distance of 12 miles. The two ditches thus formed one continuous ditch, draining agricultural lands lying to the north of the city. Both ditches, and the assessment districts in connection with them, are conceded to have been lawfully established.\n In 1916 the river broke through its banks into the area drained by the spur ditch, and uniting with the flood water flowing from the river through ditch No. 2, flooded the main ditch, No. 1, washed out and destroyed a spillway on ditch No. 1, and in its uncontrolled flow to the river caused extensive damage. There was danger that the river by its flow through the ditch would be diverted from its natural course, cutting off the city's water supply and causing other damage to the city and to individuals.\n In August, 1916, a proceeding was instituted by petition to the board of county commissioners, purporting to be pursuant to statute, 'to reconstruct and improve drainage ditches Nos. 1 and 2 ... and to pay therefor by an assessment upon the property, persons and corporations benefitted.' This proceeding resulted in resolutions of the commissioners purporting to establish 'drainage district No. 1 and 2' and providing for the construction of the proposed ditch. The location fixed for it however, was identical with that of the old ditches No. 1 and No. 2. The county commissioners then caused the previously established ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2 to be diked, cleaned out, and widened and deepened at certain points; the river to be straightened, and the spillway to be reconstructed so as to continue and safeguard the flow of water through ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2. The cost was approximately $255,000.\n Proceedings were then had by the county commissioners for the assessment of benefits to defray the expenses thus incurred. The assessments of benefits were extended \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 383]\n\u00a0\n to areas not embraced in the assessment districts of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2, as previously established, and resulted in the assessment of benefits now complained of, made against all the appellees, some of whom did and some of whom did not own land within the area originally assessed for the establishment of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2. When the present suits were commenced, notice had been given to the appellees of a tentative assessment of benefits to their land, and of a proceeding to be had to equalize benefits before final assessments for the cost of construction.\n Both courts below found that the drainage ditch No. 1 and 2 was not a new project, but was in fact identical with the previously established ditches No. 1 and No. 2; that no new or additional drainage was established, and that the only purpose of the proceedings was to provide for the maintenance and repair of the previously established ditches by assessing the cost on tracts not included within the area originally assessed for their construction. For these reasons, among others, both courts held that the proceedings had by the board of county commissioners to apportion and assess benefits on land outside the original drainage districts were unauthorized and void under the statutes of South Dakota. In this we think they were right.\n Section 8458 of the South Dakota Revised Code of 1919 provides that the board of county commissioners 'may establish and cause to be constructed any ditch or drain; may provide for the straightening or enlargement of any water course or drain previously constructed, and may provide for the maintenance of such ditch, drain or water course. ...'\n Section 8476 provides that the powers conferred for establishing and constructing drains 'shall also extend to the include the deepening and widening of any drains \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n which have heretofore been or may hereafter be constructed,' and that no proceedings shall be had under this section 'except upon notice and the other procedure prescribed herein for the construction of drains.'\n The procedure prescribed by the South Dakota statutes embraces two distinct schemes or methods for carrying into effect the authority of the board of county commissioners. The one relates exclusively to the establishment and construction of proposed drainage; the other to assessments for further costs and maintenance of drainage already established. With reference to the establishment of proposed drainage, it is provided that the board shall act only on petition of a landowner affected by the 'proposed drainage' (section 8459) and upon the filing of the petition the board shall cause the 'proposed route' of the drainage to be inspected and, if necessary, surveyed (section 8460). It is required to hold a hearing on notice describing the proposed drainage (section 8461), and after hearing the drainage 'may be established' in accordance with the petition or the findings of the board (section 8462). After the establishment of the drainage, the board is required to determine 'the proportion of benefits of the proposed drainage,' and to fix a time and place for equalization of benefits, on notice describing the land affected by the 'proposed drainage,' and to state the proportion of benefits fixed for each tract, benefits being considered 'such as accrue directly by the construction of such drainage or indirectly by virtue of such drainage being an outlet for connection drains that may be subsequently constructed.' Section 8463. Following equalization of benefits as prescribed, the board is authorized to make an assessment against each tract, 'in proportion to the benefits as equalized,' for the purpose of paying damages and the cost of establishment, which are stated to include all the expenses 'incurred or to be incurred that in any way contributed or will contribute to the establishment or con- \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n struction of the drainage. All assessments are made perpetual liens upon the tracts assessed. Section 8464\n\n\n The only provisions contained in the statutes for equalization of benefits are those found in the sections referred to, which have to do with the establishment of proposed drainage. By section 8477 all drains, when constructed, are in charge of the board of county commissioners, who are made responsible for keeping them open and in repair. The statutory provisions which deal with assessments for further costs of construction and for maintenance are found in sections 8467 and 8470, the material portions of which are printed in the margin. \n1\n It will be observed that there is no provision for the assessment or equalization of benefits in connection with the procedure provided in those sections for assessing for further costs of construction and maintenance. No such provision is required; for by the \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n express terms of section 8467 the procedure for making assessments for the additional cost of construction is like that provided for the first assessment for construction (section 8464) after the equalization of benefits has been had under section 8463; and by section 8470 assessments for maintenance are to he made 'upon the landowners affected in the proportions determined for such drainage.' Both sections clearly contemplate that assessments for additional construction and for maintenance are to be made upon those lands which are already embraced within the drainage project, and on which the proportion of benefits has been determined by equalization proceedings had after the establishment of the original project.\n The statutes of South Dakota contain no provision for assessing the cost of reconstruction or maintenance of an existing drainage project except in the two sections last referred to, and they make no provision for assessing such costs upon lands not embraced within or assessed in connection with the drainage as originally established. Whether the cost of construction work actually done on ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2 and involved in this litigation be regarded as additional costs of construction or as cost of maintenance, or partly one and partly the other, there is no statutory authority for assessing that cost on lands not included in the original drainage district.\n By section 8489 it is provided that:\n'If any proceeding for the location, establishment or construction of any drain ... has been ... voluntarily abandoned ... for any cause, the board of county commissioners may nevertheless ... locate a drain ... under the same of different names and in the same or different locations from those described in the ... abandoned proceeding under the provisions of this article.'\n\n But the original proceedings for the establishment and construction of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2 were not abandoned, and the proceedings had for levying the assessments now \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n in question were not framed or conducted on that theory. They were consequently without authority in law and could not affect the rights of appellees.\n While there are expressions in the opinion in Gilseth v. Risty, 193 N. W. 132, 46 S. D. 374, decided after these suits were begun, which, standing by themselves, might be regarded as supporting the view that the proceedings now in question were authorized by the statutes of South Dakota, the court clearly rested its decision upon other grounds. It is the duty of the federal courts, in suits brought in or removed to the district courts, to decide for themselves all relevant questions of state law, and while they will follow the decisions of state courts as to the interpretation of a state statute, we do not think that the case of Gilseth v. Risty, supra, so clearly or decisively passed upon the question here involved as to control our decision. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 30 S. Ct. 140, \n215 U.S. 349\n; Barber v. Pittsburgh, etc., Railway, 17 S. Ct. 488, \n166 U.S. 83\n, 99. And see Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, 45 S. Ct. 543, \n268 U.S. 458\n.\n As our decision in these cases turns on the construction and application of the state law, we do not pass upon the constitutional questions raised. See Bohler v. Callaway, 45 S. Ct. 431, \n267 U.S. 479\n, 489; Chicago G. W. Ry. v. Rendall, 45 S. Ct. 55, \n266 U.S. 94\n, 97-98. They are, however, questions of substance and sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to pass on the whole case. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., supra; Chicago G. W. Ry. v. Kendall, supra; Bohler v. Callaway, supra.\n The objections to the exercise of equity jurisdiction in these cases require no extended comment. When the appellees filed their bills, the drainage project had been completed and costruction warrants had been issued for the work done; benefits apportioned to the lands of the appellee had been tentatively fixed and notice of a hearing for the equalization of benefits had been given. The steps next in order after the hearing would have been the \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n assessment of costs of construction and the filing of copies of the assessment with the county treasurer, which would have established a lien on the property assessed. Section 8464. As the principal ground for appellees' suits was the invalidity of the whole proceeding and not merely inequality in apportionment of benefits, and as the effect of the proposed equalization would have been to bring the lands of appellees into the newly established drainage district and subject them to future assessments for construction costs and for maintendance, the threatened injury was imminent and the suits were not premature. The assessment, if made, would have established a lien on the appellees' property which would be a cloud on title-to say nothing of the fact that the effect of the pending proceeding would have been to subject their property to future assessments; hence the case was one for equitable relief unless there was a plain and adequate remedy at law. Ohio Tax Cases, 34 S. Ct. 372, \n232 U.S. 576\n; Shaffer v. Carter, 40 S. Ct. 221, \n252 U.S. 37\n, 46; Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. v. Osborne, 44 S. Ct. 431, \n265 U.S. 14\n. The remedy by appeal to the state court under section 8469 does not appear to be coextensive with the relief which equity may give. In any event, it is not one which may be availed of at law in the federal courts, and the test of equity jurisdiction in a federal court is the inadequacy of the remedy on the law side of that court and not the inadequacy of the remedies afforded by the state courts. Smyth v. Ames, 18 S. Ct. 418, \n169 U.S. 466\n; Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. Osborne, supra.\n It does not appear that the state law affords a remedy by payment of the assessment and suit to recover it back, which, if it exists, can be availed of in the federal courts (Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, 33 S. Ct. 942, \n229 U.S. 481\n, 486), or that such remedy, if available, would not entail a multiplicity of suits. It is not suggested that section 6826 of the state Code, which permits suits to recover taxes and forbids injunctions to restrain their collection. has any \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n application to assessments for drainage, In Gilseth v. Risty, supra, the Supreme Court of the state evidently did not deem that section applicable as it did not rely upon it in denying relief. The legal remedy under the state law being uncertain, the federal court has jurisdiction in equity to enjoin the assessment. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 41 S. Ct. 272, \n255 U.S. 288\n.\n The objection that it was not shown that these cases involve the jurisdictional amount is unsubstantial. The court below found that the amount due on outstanding construction warrants was approximately $300,000 and that the tentative apportionment of benefits, if undisturbed, would result in assessments for amounts ranging from $6,000 to $50,000 against the lands of the appellees. As the substantial basis of the suits was want of jurisdiction in the board of county commissioners to make the apportionment and assessment, we think the jurisdictional amount was necessarily involved.\n Appellees are not estopped to seek the relief which was granted because of any relations which they may have had to the proceedings or to the construction work which had been carried on before notice of the tentative apportionment of benefits. The decrees of the District Court, which remain undisturbed, enjoin the assessments and further proceedings only so far as they affect lands lying outside of the original assessment areas of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2. As none of the appellees could have had any notice of the proposal to assess lands lying outside of these areas, until the published notice of the apportionment of benefits, their previous conduct cannot estop them from seeking the relief granted. Other objections were made to the decrees below, but they are not of sufficient gravity to require notice here.\n There is no diversity of citizenship in No. 99, the appellee in that case being the city of Sioux Falls, a South Dakota municipal corporation. Nor was any substantial \n\n[270 U.S. 378, 390]\n\u00a0\n federal question raised by the bill of complaint in that suit. The power of the state and its agencies over municipal corporations within its territory is not restrained by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Trenton v. New Jersey, 43 S. Ct. 534, \n262 U.S. 182\n, 29 A. L. R. 1471; and see Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil Co., 39 S. Ct. 526, \n250 U.S. 394\n. The decree in that case must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the plaintiff's bill.\n No. 99, reversed and remanded.\n Nos. 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100, affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 8467.

EMMERSON(1926)\nNo. 210\nArgued: March 12, 1926Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul O'Donnell, of Chicago, Ill., and Albert L. Hopkins, and Richard S. Doyle, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Bayard Lacey Catron, of Springfield, Ill., and Edward J. Brundage, of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, a corporation organized under the laws of Illinois, and doing business in that state, filed its bill in the circuit court of Sangamon county, Illinois, for a mandatory injunction to compel the defendant in error, as secretary of state for Illinois, to accept the sum of $75.00 in full discharge of its liability for an annual franchise tax for the year 1923, imposed by section 105 of the Illinois Corporation Act, and to enjoin the defendant in error from collecting more than that amount.\n The plaintiff corporation was originally organized with an authorized capital stock of $100,000, divided into one thousand shares of the par value of $100. In 1921, the Illinois Corporation Act was amended so as to allow corporations to issue shares of no par value. Rev. Stats. Ill. ( Cahill, 1925) c. 32,  32, as amended by Act of June 11, 1921 (Laws 1921, p. 365). Shortly after the passage \n\n[271 U.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n of this act, the corporation, by amendment of its charter, converted its outstanding stock into preferred stock, and authorized and issued forthwith 10,000 shares of common stock of no par value.\n Section 105 of the Corporation Act then provided:\n'Each corporation for profit ... organized under the laws of this state or admitted to do business in this state, and required by this act to make an annual report, shall pay an annual license fee or franchise tax to the secretary of state of five cents on each one hundred dollars of the proportion of its capital stock, authoirzed by its charter in the office of the secretary of state, represented by business transacted and property located in this state. ...'\n\n The secretary of state demanded of the plaintiff corporation, under this statute, the payment of five cents on each share of no par stock, on the assumption that for the purpose of the tax, no par shares were to be valued at $100. The plaintiff took the position that there was no statutory authority for the assessment of the tax on that basis, and that, since its no par value shares had been issued as 'fully paid up and nonassessable upon the payment of five dollars for each share in cash or property,' it was liable to a tax only on the basis of that valuation, and tendered the tax so computed to the secretary of state. In a mandamus proceeding brought by the plaintiff corporation, the Supreme Court of Illinois upheld this contention and ordered the secretary of state to accept the lesser sum in satisfaction of the tax. People ex rel. Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 137 N. E. 202, 305 Ill. 348.\n After this decision, the Legislature of Illinois amended section 105 ( Laws 1923, p. 280) by adding the sentence:\n'In the event that the corporation has stock of no par value, its shares, for the purpose of fixing such fee, shall be considered to be of the par value of $100 per share.' \n\n[271 U.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff's bill in the case before us attacks the validity of the franchise tax imposed on it pursuant to this amendment, on the ground that the amendment is unconstitutional. The circuit court dismissed the bill for want of equity. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment (144 N. E. 818, 313 Ill. 137), holding that the tax was lawfully assessed. The plaintiff comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237 (Comp. St.  1214).\n\n It is urged that the selection of authorized capital stock as the basis for the franchise tax or license fee is arbitrary, and has no tendency to procure equality, and results in imposing different rates of taxation on corporations having the same issued capital stock holding the same amount of property and doing the same amount of business, whenever they have different amounts of authorized capital stock; that the mere number of authorized no par value shares regardless of their value or the amount of money or property for which they are or may be issued, is not a reasonable basis for a franchise tax, but is wholly arbitrary; that the provision of section 105 assigning an arbitrary valuation of $100 per share to no par stock for the purpose of computing the tax in question, results in a discrimination against corporations which issue shares of no par value, and in favor of those which issue them at a par value. Reliance is also placed on the invalidity of the amendment as impairing the obligation of contract (Constitution, art. 1,  10) in that the shares of the plaintiff were issued before the amendment of section 105, and at a time when, it is alleged, the law of Illinois provided that, for the purpose of this tax, no par stock was to be valued at the amount for which it was actually issued.\n In support of the argument that authorized capital stock is not a permissible basis for a franchise tax, the plaintiff relies on Air-Way Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, 45 S. Ct. 12, \n266 U.S. 71\n. That case dealt with a privilege tax, \n\n[271 U.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n laid by Ohio on a foreign corporation engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce in that and other states. It was held that a tax on such a corporation for the privilege of doing business in Ohio, where the tax was measured by that proportion of its total authorized capital stock which its business done and property owned in Ohio bore to its total business done and property owned everywhere, was invalid as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. While one factor in the computation of the tax was properly the proportion of the corporation's business done and property owned within the state, the other factor was the amount of its authorized capital stock, only a part of which had actually been issued. The authority to issue its capital stock was a privilege conferred by another state and bore no relation to any franchise granted to it by the state of Ohio or to its business and property within that state. When authorized capital stock is taken as the basis of the tax, variations in the amount of the tax are obtained, according as the corporation has a large or small amount of unissued capital stock. This was held, in the Air-Way Case, to be an unconstitutional discrimination, since it resulted in a tax larger than the tax imposed on other corporations with like privileges and like business and property within the state, but with a smaller capital authorized under the laws of the state of their creation.\n In the present case, the plaintiff corporation is organized and does all its business in Illinois. We cannot say that a state may not impose a franchise tax on a domestic corporation, measured by its authorized capital stock. See Kansas City Ry. v. Kansas, 36 S. Ct. 261, \n240 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 233 S.; Kansas City v. Stiles, 37 S. Ct. 58, \n242 U.S. 111\n.\n But the plaintiff is not in a position to raise this question. As this court has often held, one who challenges the validity of state taxation on the ground that it vio- \n\n[271 U.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n lates the equal protection clause, cannot rely on theoretical inequalities, or such as do not affect him, but must show that he is himself affected unfavorably by the discrimination of which he complains. See Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, 8 S. Ct. 961, \n125 \nU.S. 530, 552\n, 553 S.; Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., 36 S. Ct. 254, \n240 U.S. 55\n, 60; Withnell v. Ruecking Const. Co., 39 S. Ct. 200, \n249 U.S. 63\n; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, 41 S. Ct. 45, \n254 U.S. 113\n, 121. The plaintiff cannot complain that the tax is measured by authorized, instead of issued, capital stock, because all of its authoirzed capital stock has been issued. Any discrimination that exists operates, therefore, in plaintiff's favor.\n It is argued that the tax imposed is a tax at a flat rate per share on no par value stock, regardless of its value, so that different corporations are taxed at different amounts although their no par stock was issued for the same total amount of capital; and that the tax is based upon an unreasonable and discriminatory classification in which no par value stock is placed in one class and taxed at an arbitrary valuation of $ 100 per share, while par value stock is placed in another class and taxed at the value at which it is authorized to be issued. Both arguments leave out of account the nature of the tax and the essential differences between the two classes of stock.\n The tax is imposed as a franchise tax upon a domestic corporation doing business only withint the state. It spower to issue shares of both classes is derived from the laws of Illinois. The amount which may be issued; the manner of issue; the liability of holders of these shares and all other incidents of them, are regulated by the law of that state. The tax is not a property tax imposed on shares of stock or on the assets of the corporation. within the state. Its power to issue shares which includes the privilege, whether exercised or not, of issuing \n\n[271 U.S. 50, 56]\n\u00a0\n and using when issued, a particular kind of stock known as 'no par value stock.' As the stock may, under the statute, be issued for as much as $100 a share, if the company so chooses, the statute fixes the maximum extent to which the privilege may be exercised as the basis for computing the tax.\n Neither this privilege nor the corresponding privilege of issuing par value stock bears any necessary relation to the value of the stock or the assets of the corporation; and the tax is imposed whether or not the stock is issued and without regard to the value of the stock or of the corporate property. We cannot say that the value of the corporation's franchise may not be measured by the number of no par shares which may be issued rather than their value when issued. The only question with which we need be concerned is whether there are such differences between the two privileges to issue the two classes of stock, as to constitute a proper basis for classification for purposes of taxation, so that the amount of the tax in the one case may be based on the issue price of the stock, and in the other upon the maximum price at which it may be issued regardless of the price at which it actually is issued.\n That there are differences of practical importance between the two classes of stock and the privileges of issuing and using them is sufficiently evidenced by the very general adoption of legislation authorizing the issue of no par value stock, and by the widespread practice of issuing that type of corporate shares.\n The nature of the more important of these differences sufficiently appears from the provisions of the Illinois statute as interpreted and applied in the opinion below in the Supreme Court of Illinois. Par value stock may be issued only for money or property equivalent to the par value. No par value stock may be issued for money or property of any amount or value, provided it is not less \n\n[271 U.S. 50, 57]\n\u00a0\n than $5 nor more than $100 per share. From this it follows that all the par value stock of an authorized class must be issued, if issued at all, at a uniform value or price, while no par value stock may be issued from time to time at different prices or values, although the holders of all these shares are entitled to share equally in the distribution of profits of the corporation. The liability of stockholders of the two classes of stock for the debts of the corporation may be different, and greater facility is permitted in the issuance and marketing of no par value shares than in the case of stock having a par value.\n These differences, both in the legal incidents and in the practical uses of the two classes of stock, not only are a basis for classification of them for purposes of taxation, but make unavoidable certain differences in the method of assessing this tax. Authorized capital stock cannot well be used as the measure of a tax unless some arbitrary value is assigned to the no par shares; for they may be issued from time to time at varying prices, and, until issued, they cannot have any value. To require the stock to be issued at a value fixed in advance of its issue, and to make that value the basis of the tax, would in effect abolish no par stock. Because of the essential differences between the two kinds of stock, it is difficult to conceive of any other method of assessing the tax which would save the character of no par value stock and not result in similar inequalities.\n The inequalities complained of result from a classification which, being founded upon real differences, is not unreasonable, and the discrimination which results from it it not arbitrary or prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. It is enough that the classification is reasonably founded upon or related to some permissible policy of taxation. Watson v. State Comptroller, 41 S. Ct. 43, \n254 U.S. 122\n; Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, 12 S. Ct. 250, \n142 U.S. 339\n; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, 21 S. Ct. 43, \n179 U.S. 89\n; Clement National Bank v. Vermont, 34 S.

That plaintiff's stock when issued was not subject to the tax computed at the rate of $100 per share, which was later authorized by section 105 as amended, was decided in Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 137 N. E. 202, 305 Ill. 348. The fact that the corporation issued its stock under statutes which were later so interpreted can give rise to no inference that the state contracted not to increase or otherwise modify the tax. See Home Ins. Co. v. City Council, \n93 U.S. 116\n; Memphis Gas Co. v. Shelby County, 3 S. Ct. 205, \n109 U.S. 398\n; Wisconsin & Michigan R. Co. v. Powers, 24 S.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 153\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 154, 155]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Nathan Wm. MacChesney (of MacChesney & Becker), of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., and Blackburn Esterline, Asst. Sol. Gen., both of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Wilbur Rogers was a major of Field Artillery in the Regular Army of the United States until January 26, \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 156]\n\u00a0\n 1921, when by an order, of that date, issued by the Secretary of War, he was placed on the retired list, under section 24b of the Act of June 4, 1920. On the ground that the order was illegal and void, he brought this action in the Court of Claims to recover the difference between the pay and allowances of a major of Field Artillery on the active list from January 26, 1921, to January 26, 1922, and the retired pay for the same period which he actually received; this difference amounting to about $4, 300. A general traverse was entered, and the issues were heard and findings of fact made by the court.\n The Act of June 4, 1920, c. 227, 41 Stat. 759, 773 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 2048a), commonly called the Reorganization Act, provides:\n'Sec. 24b. Classification of Officers.-Immediately upon the passage of this act, and in September of 1921 and every year thereafter, the President shall convene a board of not less than five general officers, which shall arrange all officers in two classes, namely: Class A, consisting of officers who should be retained in the service, and class B, of officers who should not be retained in the service. Until otherwise finally classified, all officers shall be regarded as belonging to class A, and shall be promoted according to the provisions of this act to fill any vacancies which may occur prior to such final classification. No officer shall be finally classified in class B until he shall have been given an opportunity to appear before a court of inquiry. In such court of inquiry he shall be furnished with a full copy of the official records upon which the proposed classification is based and shall be given an opportunity to present testimony in his own behalf. The record of such court of inquiry shall be forwarded to the final classification board for reconsideration of the case, and after such consideration the finding of said classification board shall be final and not subject to further revision except upon the order of the President. Whenever an officer is placed in class B, a board of not less than three \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 157]\n\u00a0\n officers shall be convened to determine whether such classification is due to his neglect, misconduct or avoidable habits. If the finding is affirmative, he shall be discharged from the Army; if negative, he shall be placed on the unlimited retire list with pay,' etc.\n\n The Court of Claims found that the law had been complied with and dismissed the petition.\n The grounds relied on by the petitioner for the appeal, as stated in his brief, are:\n First, that plaintiff was prevented by military law from going forward before the court of inquiry with testimony which he desired to give, which was necessary to meet the adverse charges in his record which were before the court of inquiry and the prima facie case made out against him by the provisional classification board.\n Second, that the record of the court of inquiry was not a complete record as required by law, in that there is no mention of the peremptory closing of the court, and nothing to show that the new evidence which Maj. Rogers desired to give was excluded.\n Third, that the court of inquiry made an error of law when it assumed that it could arbitrarily exclude the testimony of Maj. Rogers and other witnesses, once it had determined to recommend that Maj. Rogers be retained on the active list, inasmuch as its decision was not final, as shown by the case and provided by the statute.\n Fourth, that the Court of Claims made an error of law when it made a finding of fact that Maj. Rogers was excused as a witness and did not complete the testimony which he desired to give, although he was not prevented from doing so by the court.\n After the preliminary board of classification had classified the plaintiff in class B, he applied for opportunity to appear before a court of inquiry, which was duly appointed and convened at Chicago, November 20, 1920. He was assisted by counsel. Lieut. Col. Horace F. \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n Sykes, of the Infantry. The plaintiff was furnished with copies from the official records of his service, which copies contained only the unfavorable portions of his record, upon which the action of the board was based. The plaintiff thereupon applied to the War Department for the complete record of his service, but his request was not granted. He was, however, permitted to read the complete record of his service prior to the meeting of the court of inquiry and during its proceedings. It was a complete record of plaintiff's services as an officer of the Army from the date of his first commission therein to the date of the convening of said court of inquiry.\n The plaintiff called to the attention of the court of inquiry certain charges preferred against him by Col. Harry C. Williams, of the Field Artillery, as shown in the record. The court heard the plaintiff upon these charges, but discouraged any further evidence relative thereto, upon the grounds stated by the president of said court in his evidence before the Court of Claims that the court had received instructions to disregard any charges against any officer who had not been brought to trial on any charges, or to whom the charges had not been read. The plaintiff had testified that he had never been acquainted with these charges until he was notified that he had been put in class B.\n While the plaintiff was on the witness stand testifying in reference to adverse reports in his record, the court, through its president, stated, 'That will be all,' whereupon he was excused as a witness, and did not complete the testimony which he desired to give, although, as the Court of Claims finds, he was not prevented from doing so by the court.\n During the course of the hearing before the court of inquiry, the presiding officer addressed plaintiff's counsel as follows:\n'It is the suggestion of the court, merely a suggestion, you understand, that counsel rest his case.' \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 159]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for the plaintiff thereupon stated to the court that he had more evidence that he desired to submit, whereupon the presiding officer stated:\n\n'I wish to repeat that it is the suggestion of the court that counsel rest his case.'\n\n Thereupon the counsel for the plaintiff again stated to the court that he had other evidence, and that there were six witnesses in the building whom he desired to call, and a seventh witness who was in the city and waiting to be called by telephone. The presiding officer thereupon stated emphatically, striking his hand forcibly on his desk:\n'I wish to reiterate that it is the suggestion of the court that counsel rest his case.'\n\n The plaintiff thereupon closed his case. At the time plaintiff had in the same building wherein the court was sitting, six witnesses, and a seventh witness, an army officer, waiting to be notified by telephone to appear. These witnesses would have testified as to the charges which the court had decided to ignore, but were not called by the plaintiff. The Court of Claims finds that the plaintiff made no protest to the court because they were not called.\n A copy of the official records was incorporated in the record of the court of inquiry. The court ruled as a matter of law that a favorable efficiency report could be discussed, but should not be incorporated in the record of the court, because these reports were on file in the War Department and would be considered, as they were, by the final board of classification.\n At the conclusion of the hearing the court of inquiry made the following determination:\n'The court is of the opinion that Maj. Wilbur Rogers should not be continued in class B.'\n\n It appears that the plaintiff by mail, having received the record of the court of inquiry, complained to the \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 160]\n\u00a0\n recorder of the court that the record contained errors, but that the recorder refused to rectify them.\n The final classification board, after considering the record received from the court of inquiry as additional evidence, finally classified the plaintiff in class B.\n It does not appear to us that there in anything in the findings of the Court of Claims to show that the proceedings by which the plaintiff was classified in class B. were rendered invalid. This court has had occasion to consider the Reorganization Act under which this retirement was ordered. In the case of French v. Weeks, 42 S. Ct. 505, \n259 \nU.S. 326, 327\n, 328 S. (66 L. Ed. 965) we said:\n'The Army Reorganization Act is intended to provide for a reduction of the Army of the United States to a peace basis while maintaining a standard of high efficiency. To contribute to this purpose, Congress made elaborate provision in the act for retaining in the service officers who had proved their capacity and fitness for command, and for retiring or discharging those who, for any reason, were found to be unfit. Every step of this process is committed to military tribunals, made up of officers who by experience and training should be the best qualified men in the country for such a duty, but with their action all subject, as we shall see, to the supervisory control of the President of the United States.\n\n'Not being in any sense a penal statute, the act should be liberally construed to promote its purpose, and it is of first importance that that purpose shall not be frustrated by unnecessarily placing technical limitations upon the agencies which are to carry it into effect.'\n\n It is conceded on behalf of the plaintiff that the procedure required by the statute was followed in the organization of the boards and the court of inquiry. It was objected in the court below and in the assignments of error here that the plaintiff was not furnished with a copy of the official records in the court of inquiry upon \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 161]\n\u00a0\n which the proposed classification was based. As a matter of fact, he was furnished with a written copy for his own keeping and use of everything that was adverse to him in his record, and he was given in the court of inquiry a full opportunity to consult his entire record. We do not think that the difference between what was required by the statute and what was actually afforded him in the matter was of sufficient substance to invalidate the proceedings.\n The chief complaint of plaintiff, when the briefs in his behalf are analyzed, is that he was prevented by the court from introducing additional evidence of cumulative character to disprove charges which the court of inquiry, upon the statement in the plaintiff's own evidence that he had never been presented with the charges and never been called upon to answer them, completely ignored. The court did so, as explained by the president of the court of inquiry, in accordance with instructions received by the court to disregard any charges against any officer who had not been brought to trial on them, or to whom they had not been read. The recommendation of the court of inquiry was that the plaintiff be retained in class A. This was doubtless the reason why the court of inquiry did not think it necessary to call additional witnesses, especially in reference to a subject-matter that could not affect the standing of the officer. In the absence of any other circumstances, and in the face of the presumption of regularity that must obtain in proceedings of this sort, we cannot assume that the final board of classification considered, as a basis for putting the plaintiff in class B, charges which had never been presented to him, charges which he denied, and charges which the court of inquiry ignored.\n It is claimed that the plaintiff was injured by the failure of the recorder of the court to include in the record of the court of inquiry the colloquy between the plaintiff and his \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 162]\n\u00a0\n counsel on the one hand, and the court of inquiry on the other, with reference to discontinuing the hearing. We do not think that, if the colloquy had been put in the record, it would have made any substantial difference in its effect. We have no means of knowing exactly what the record of the court of inquiry as forwarded to the board of final classification contained, except from the finding of the Court of Claims, which shows that it contained all that the plaintiff put in in the way of records and documents and his evidence. In view of this we cannot assume that the complaint by the plaintiff that the record was defective was well founded.\n The Court of Claims found that the plaintiff was not prevented from putting in the additional evidence on the charges which were subsequently ignored. It is argued to us that the attitude of the court was in effect and as a matter of military law a military order preventing the submission of further evidence, and making it a military offense for the plaintiff to have insisted on introducing his witnesses. Were the matter important, we should have difficulty in yielding to such a view. The Court of Claims finds in effect that the action of plaintiff in not producing further evidence was voluntary acquiescence by him in the suggestion of the court. He had counsel who presumably knew his rights under the statute, and, if such evidence was deemed material and important, we must assume that the counsel would have asserted his right and insisted on the production of the evidence.\n Much of the briefs of counsel for the plaintiff in error is made up of statements based on, and quotations from, the evidence before the Court of Claims. We cannot consider this. We are limited to the findings of the Court of Claims. United States v. Smith, \n94 U.S. 214\n; Stone v. United States, 17 S. Ct. 71, \n164 U.S. 380\n; Crocker v.

Ct. 426, \n250 U.S. 88\n, 93. \n\n[270 U.S. 154, 163]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in the record before us which would justify us in holding the proceedings invalid. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSALINGER v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 238\nArgued: October 21, 1926Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 542, 543]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benjamin I, Salinger, of Sious City, Iowa, Arthur F. Mullen, of Omaha, Neb., and Robert Healy, of Ft. Dodge, Iowa, for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for the United\n Messrs. Benjamin I. Salinger, of Sioux\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 542, 544]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this direct writ of error we are asked to review a judgment of conviction in the federal district court for South Dakota for a violation of section 215 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10385), which makes it a criminal offense to use the mail for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud. The writ was sued out on the assumption that the case is one involving the construction and application of certain provisions of the Constitution relating to accusations and prosecutions for criminal offenses. If the assumption was right, the writ was properly allowed under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), as existing at that time (November 29, 1924); otherwise, the review should have been sought in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The statutes which define and distribute federal appellate jurisdiction and make the existence of a constitutional question the test of the right to a review, as also of the court in which the review may be had, always have been construed as referring to a question having sufficient substance to deserve serious consideration, and not one which is so devoid of merit as to be fanciful or frivolous, or which is not open to discussion because settled by prior decisions. Goodrich v. Ferris, \n214 \nU.S. 71, 79\n, 81 S., 28 S. Ct. 580; Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216\n, 35 S. Ct. 285; Sugarman v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 182\n, 39 S. Ct. 191. Under a different construction the restrictions and distributing provisions in the statutes would have little purpose; for constitutional questions of no substance readily could be devised and presented as mere pretexts for obtaining a review on other questions. United Surety Co. v. American Fruit Co., \n238 \nU.S. 140, 142\n, 35 S. Ct. 828\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 542, 545]\n\u00a0\n This case, being criminal, belongs to a class in which the review ordinarily is to be had in the Circuit Court of Appeals. Judicial Code,  128 (Comp. St.  1120). Therefore it becomes material to inquire whether the constitutional questions said to be involved are adequate to bring the case within the exceptional provision in section 238 for a review by this court on direct writ of error.\n The grounds advanced for invoking such a review are:\n\n 1. \nThe conviction in the district of South Dakota was in violation of the provision in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution entitling an accused to a trial in the state and district wherein the crime was committed, because (a) the indictment definitely charged the crime as committed in the Northern district of Iowa; (b) if the indictment did not so charge, it was uncertain in that it did not show whether the place of the crime was in one district or in the other; and (c) there was no evidence that the place was in the district of South Dakota.\n\n 2. \nThe charging part of the indictment was so indefinite and ambiguous that the accused was not informed of the nature of the accusation as required by the same amendment.\n\n 3. \nOn the trial hearsay evidence was admitted over the accused's objection that its admission would be in derogation of his right under that amendment to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\n\n 4. \nContrary to the Fifth Amendment, the accused was held to answer for an infamous crime otherwise than on an indictment by a grand jury, in that on the trial the court, being of opinion that part of what was charged in the indictment had no support in the evidence, withdrew that part from the jury and left them free to convict on what remained without a resubmission to a grand jury.\n When these contentions are stated, without more, some of them appear to present serious constitutional ques- \n\n[272 U.S. 542, 546]\n\u00a0\n tions; but it is quite otherwise when they are examined in connection with pertinent portions of the record and in the light of prior decisions.\n The indictment contained several counts. All related to the same scheme to defraud, but each charged a distinct use of the mail for the purpose of executing the scheme. There were three defendants. Two were acquitted on all counts. Salinger, the other defendant, was convicted on the seventh count and acquitted on the others. His conviction on that count is what we are asked to review, the assignments of error being unusual in number and directed against almost everything done in the case.\n The offense charged in that count was that the defendants devised a described scheme to defraud and, for the purpose of executing it, knowingly caused a letter to be delivered by the mail, according to the direction thereon, at Viborg, in the district of South Dakota, the letter and the direction being set forth. Then, by way of explaining how the delivery was brought about the count further charged that the defendants had caused the letter to be placed in the post office of Sioux City, Iowa, for delivery through the mail at Viborg, S. D., according to the address thereon.\n It is very plain that the offense charged was causing the letter to be delivered by mail in South Dakota in furtherance of the scheme, and that the proper place of trial was in the district of South Dakota, where the delivery was effected as intended. We so held in a proceeding where Salinger was resisting removal to that district for trial on this indictment. Salinger v. Loisel, \n265 \nU.S. 224\n, 44 S. Ct. 519. The question hardly was debatable then, and certainly has not been an open one since. The assertion that there was no evidence of the commission of the offense in that district amounts to no more than saying that the offense charged was not proved, and \n\n[272 U.S. 542, 547]\n\u00a0\n therefore that a verdict of acquittal should have been directed. But it has no bearing on the district in which the offense charged was to be tried.\n Of the contention that the indictment did not conform to the constitutional provision entitling the accused to be informed of the nature of the accusation it suffices to say that after reading the indictment we think the contention is so plainly without any fair basis as to be frivolous.\n The evidence which is characterized as hearsay and said to have been received in violation of the accused's right to be confronted with the witnesses against him consisted of letters, bank deposit slips and book entries. As to many items their admission became of no moment when Salinger was acquitted on all but one of the counts and the other defendants on all. As to some the instructions to the jury prevented their admission from affecting Salinger, for the court said that as to each defendant the question of his guilt or innocence was strictly personal and that he could not be found guilty on evidence that was not traced back to him personally, nor by reason of any conduct of others for which he was not directly accountable and responsible. Of the remaining items some must be put aside as negligible for other reasons. Those deserving mention were received on the theory, not that they were admissible in themselves, but that Salinger's acts and conduct, shown by other evidence, had brought him into such relation to them as to make them admissible in connection with that evidence. To illustrate: Some of the letters, although written by persons not produced as witnesses, were shown to have been laid before Salinger and answered by him; and on this ground they were admitted along with the answers. Evidence equally potent in showing his relation to other material items underlay their admission. Thus the challenged evidence was received, not as having merely a hearsay status, but because proved acts or conduct of Salinger had brought \n\n[272 U.S. 542, 548]\n\u00a0\n him into such relation to it as to make it more than hearsay as to him.\n The right of confrontation did not originate with the provision in the Sixth Amendment, but was a common-law right having recognized exceptions. The purpose of that provision, this court often has said, is to continue and preserve that right, and not to broaden it or disturb the exceptions. Mattox v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 237, 243\n, 15 S. Ct. 337; Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 U.S. 275\n, 281-282, 17 S. Ct. 326; Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47, 61\n, 19 S. Ct. 574; Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 31 S. Ct. 590. The present contention attributes to the right a much broader scope than it had at common law, and could not be sustained without departing from the construction put on the constitutional provision in the cases just cited.\n Plainly the question in respect of confrontation is not of any substance.\n The contention that the court, by withdrawing from the jury a part of the charge as without support in the evidence, amended the indictment and thereby prevented it from longer serving as an accusation by a grand jury is on no better plane than the others. The indictment was not amended, either actually or in legal effect. It remained just as it was returned by the grand jury, and the trial was on the charge preferred in it and not on a modified charge. After the evidence was put in, the accused, believing that part of the charge had no support in the evidence, requested that that part be withdrawn from the jury, and the court acceded to the request when the final instructions were given. The scheme to defraud as set forth in the indictment was manifold in that it comprehended several relatively distinct plans for fleecing intended victims. What the court withdrew from the jury was all of these plans but one. Thus the court ruled that the evidence while tending to sustain the charge as respects one of the plans did not give it any \n\n[272 U.S. 542, 549]\n\u00a0\n support as respects the others. Whether this was right or wrong-as to which we intimate no opinion-it did not work an amendment of the indictment and was not even remotely an infraction of the constitutional provision that 'no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury.' Amendment 5. Goto v. Lane, \n265 \nU.S. 393\n, 44 S. Ct. 525; State v. Evans, 40 La. Ann. 216, 218, 3 So. 838. And see Crain v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 625, 636\n, 16 S. Ct. 952; Hall v. United States, \n168 U.S. 632\n, 638-639, 18 S. Ct. 237. In the case of Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S. Ct. 781, on which the accused relies, there was an actual amendment or alteration of the indictment to avoid an adverse ruling on demurrer, and the trial was on the amended charge without a resubmission to a grand jury. The principle on which the decision proceeded is not broader than the situation to which it was applied.\n We are of opinion that the constitutional questions advanced to secure the direct writ of error are all so wanting in substance that they afford no basis for the writ.\n As the writ was allowed before the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, the case must be transferred to the Circuit Court of Appeals under the Act of September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 (Comp. St.  1215a), which, although repealed by the Act of 1925, is to be applied, under the terms of the saving clause, to proceedings for the review of judgments rendered theretofore.\n Transferred to Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANCHEZ v. DEERING(1926)\nNo. 134\nArgued: January 14, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. W. Dewhurst, of St. Augustine, Fla., for appellants.\n Mr. F. M. Hudson, of Miami, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a bill filed April 7, 1920, appellants sought to establish their right to one-half interest in 175 acres of land on Key Biscayne, Dade county, Fla., granted by Gov. White to Pedro Fornells January 18, 1805, when the Floridas were under the dominion of Spain. Appellee Deering acquired legal title to the whole tract June 28, 1913\n\n\n In 1824, under claim of ownership through conveyance from Raphael Andreu, stepson of Fornells and alleged by her to be his sole heir, Mary Ann Davis obtained confirmation of the grant in herself of the board of commissioners empowered under the Act of March 3, 1823, c. 29, 3 Stat. 754, to ascertain and confirm title to East Florida lands arising under patents, grants, concessions or orders of survey dated prior to January 24, 1818. The board's action was approved and confirmed by Act of February 8, 1827, c. 9, 4 Stat. 202. In 1847 the lands were surveyed under direction of the Surveyor General and segregated from the public domain.\n June 30, 1827, Mrs. Davis and her husband deeded three acres to the United States and the Cape Florida Lighthouse was constructed thereon. They subsequently abandoned the light and, March 4, 1903, conveyed the three acres to Waters S. Davis, one of the heirs of Mary Ann Davis, whose death occurred in 1885. He had purchased the interests of all other heirs during 1893. April 23, 1896, patent for the 175 acres issued to Mary Ann \n\n[270 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n Davis, but this was not delivered until 1898, because of protest by Venancio Sanchez, who claimed an interest. This protest was overruled by the Surveyor General, the Land Commissioner, and the Secretary of the Interior. June 28, 1913, Waters S. Davis deeded the lands to Deering.\n Complainants deraign their title to an undivided one-half interest through deed to Venancio Sanchez from Antonia Porsila (or Porala), daughter of Pedro Fornells and half-sister of Raphael Andreu, executed by her May 26, 1843. About 1840 the husband of Mary Ann Davis sought to interest Sanchez, then and long afterwards a merchant at St. Augustine, Fla., in developing Key Biscayne. As a result, it is alleged, Sanchez discovered that Mrs. Davis did not own the entire property, and that Antonia Porsila had inherited an interest therein. Accordingly he went to Havana and there secured the conveyance of the latter's interest.\n Sanchez died in 1899. He knew Raphael Andreu, who lived for a long time at St. Augustine and probably died there, but the time is not shown. It does not appear when Antonia Porsila died.\n Complainants sought to meet the anticipated defense of laches by alleging that they were not able to secure legal evidence of the relationship between Raphael Andreu and Antonia Porsila until the discovery of an index to the Spanish archives during the year 1919.\n The trial court dismissed the bill upon motion, holding that appellants were chargeable with laches, because of the long delay in seeking relief after issuance of the patent of 1896. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decree, upon the view that the delay extended from the survey of 1847 when Mary Ann Davis secured full legal title. 298 F. 286.\n Under circumstances very similar to those here presented, Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozoy Marcos, 35 S. Ct. 446, \n236 U.S. 635\n, holds \n\n[270 U.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n that confirmation of the Spanish grant by Congress followed by survey of the land passed the legal title. We can see no reason to depart from this view. The title of Mary Ann Davis dates from 1847. For more than 70 years thereafter appellants and their predecessors failed to assert their rights, if any, by legal proceedings. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals 'that it is too late now to enter into the merits of a claim of title which could have been asserted and enforced if good, and rejected if bad, while the witnesses who knew about it were living and could have testified with reference to it.'\n The decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHLESINGER v. STATE OF WISCONSIN(1926)\nNo. 146\nArgued: January 18, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles F. Fawsett, Edward M. Smart, and Charles E. Monroe, all of Milwaukee, Wis., for plaintiffs in error.[ Schlesinger v. State of Wisconsin \n270 U.S. 230\n (1926) ]\n\n\n[270 U.S. 230, 234]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. E. Bump and Herman L. Ekern, both of Madison, Wis., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 230, 236]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 1087-1, chapter 64ff, of the Wisconsin Statutes 1919, provides:\n'A tax shall be and is hereby imposed upon any transfer of property, real, personal or mixed ... to any person ... within the state, in the following cases, except as hereinafter provided:\n\n'(1) When the transfer is by will or by the interstate laws of this state from any person dying possessed of the property while a resident of the state.\n\n'(2) When a transfer is by will or interstate law, of property within the state or within its jurisdiction and the decedent was a nonresident of the state at the time of his death.\n\n'(3) When the transfer is of property made by a resident or by a nonresident when such nonresident's property is within this state, or within its jurisdiction, by deed, grant. bargain, sale or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, vendor or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death. Every transfer by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift, made within six years prior to the death of the grantor, vendor or donor, of a material part of his estate, or in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, and without an adequate valuable consideration, shall be construed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this section.'\n\n These provisions were taken from section 1, c. 44, Laws of 1903, except that the last sentence of subdivision 3 (italicized) was added by chapter 643, Laws of 1913\n\n\n Section 1087-2, c. 64ff, imposes taxes upon transfers described by section 1087-1 varying from 1 to 5 per \n\n[270 U.S. 230, 237]\n\u00a0\n centum, according to relationship of the parties, when the value is not above $25,000. On larger ones the rates are from two to five times higher, with 15 per centum as the maximum.\n'Section 1087-5 (chapter 64ff). 1. All taxes imposed by this act shall be due and payable at the time of the transfer, except as hereinafter provided; and every such tax shall be and remain a lien upon the property transferred until paid, and the person to whom the property is transferred and the administrators, executors, and trustees of every estate so transferred shall be personally liable for such tax until its payment.'\n\n Other provisions of chapter 64ff provide for determination, assessment and collection of the tax. In the Revised Statutes of 1921 and 1925, chapter 64ff became chapter 72, and section numbers were changed 1087-1 became 72.01, 1087-2 became 72.02, 1087-5 became 72.05, etc.\n In Estate of Ebeling (1919) 172 N. W. 734, 169 Wis. 432, 4 A. L. R. 1519, the court held:\n'Section 1087-1, Stats., as amended by chapter 643, Laws 1913, which provides that gifts of a material part of a donor's estate, made within six years prior to his death, shall be construed to have been made in contemplation of death so far as transfer taxes are concerned, constitutes a legislative definition of what is a transfer in contemplation of death, and not a mere rule of law making the fact of such gifts prima facie evidence that they were made in contemplation of death.'\n\n Estate of Stephenson, 177 N. W. 579, 171 Wis. 452, 459: A gift of $23, 000 constitutes a material part of an estate valued at more than $1,000, 000; also, gifts by decedents in contemplation of death must be treated, for purposes of taxation, as part of their estates.\n In re Uhilein's Will (Wis.) 203 N. W. 742, May 12, 1925:\n'As stated in the Schlesinger Case, the statute was enacted for the purpose of enabling the taxing officials of the state to make an \n\n[270 U.S. 230, 238]\n\u00a0\n efficient and practical administration of the inheritance tax law . ... It is settled in this state that the tax attaches, not at the date of the transfer of the gift, but at the date of the death of the donor. ... Under our decisions the gifts that have been made within six years of the donor's death, together with the amount of the estate left by the donor at the time of his death, constitute his estate, and must be administered, so far as inheritance tax proceedings are concerned, as one estate. The tax does not attach and become vested in the state until the death of the donor. When the gift is made and the donee receives it, there is no certainty that an inheritance tax will ever be levied upon the gift.'\n\n In the present cause the Milwaukee county court found that Schlesinger died testate January 3, 1921, leaving a large estate; that within six years he had made four separate gifts, aggregating more than $5, 000,000, to his wife and three children; that none of these was really made in view, anticipation, expectation, apprehension or contemplation of death. And it held that because made within six years before death these gifts 'are by the express terms of section 72.01 (formerly section 1087-1), clause (3), of the statutes subject to inheritance taxes, although not in fact made in contemplation of death.' An appropriate order so adjudged. The executors and children appealed, the Supreme Court affirmed the order ( 199 N. W. 951, 184 Wis. 1), and thereupon they brought the matter here.\n Plaintiffs in error maintain that, as construed and applied below, the quoted tax provisions deprive them of property without due process of law, deny them the equal protection of the laws, and conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Supreme Court of the state said:\n'The tax in question is not a property tax but a tax upon the right to receive property from a decedent. It is an excise tax.' \n\n[270 U.S. 230, 239]\n\u00a0\n 'Such (legislative) intent was to tax only gifts made in contemplation of death. That is the only class created. The legislature says that all gifts made within six years of the donor's death shall be construed to be made in contemplation of death,' ( which means) 'that they shall conclusively be held to be gifts made in contemplation of death and shall fall within the one taxable class of gifts created by the legislature.' 'In our case the legislative intent, we think, is clear that the specified gifts were to be conclusively construed to be gifts in contemplation of death.' 'We agree with the appellants that the classification made will not support a tax as one on gifts inter vivos only. Under such taxation the classification is wholly arbitrary and void. We perceive no more reason why such gifts inter vivos should be taxed than gifts made within six years of marriage or any other event. It is because only one class of gifts closely connected with and a part of the inheritance tax law is created that the law becomes valid. Gifts made in contemplation of death stand in a class by themselves, and as such they are made a part of the inheritance tax law to the end that it may be effectively administered. We adhere to the ruling in the Ebeling Case.'\n\n No question is made of the state's power to tax gifts actually made in anticipation of death, as though the property passed by will or descent; nor is there denial of the power of the state to tax gifts inter vivos when not arbitrarily exerted.\n The challenged enactment plainly undertakes to raise a conclusive presumption that all material gifts within six years of death were made in anticipation of it and to lay a graduated inheritance tax upon them without regard to the actual intent. The presumption is declared to be conclusive and cannot be overcome by evidence. It is no mere prima facie presumption of fact.\n The court below declared that a tax on gifts inter vivos only could not be so laid as to hit those made within six \n\n[270 U.S. 230, 240]\n\u00a0\n years of the donor's death and exempt all others-this would be 'wholly arbitrary.' We agree with this view and are of opinion that such a classification would be in plain conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. The legislative action here challenged is no less arbitrary. Gifts inter vivos within six years of death, but in fact made without contemplation thereof, are first conclusively presumed to have been so made without regard to actualities, while like gifts at other times are not thus treated. There is no adequate basis for this distinction. Secondly, they are subjected to graduated taxes which could not properly be laid on all gifts or, indeed, upon any gift without testamentary character.\n The presumption and consequent taxation are defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and discretion, the Legislature found them necessary in order to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say, A. may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order to enable the state readily to collect lawful charges against B. Rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution are not to be so lightly treated; they are superior to this supposed necessity. The state is forbidden to deny due process of law or the equal protection of the laws for any purpose whatsoever.\n No new doctrine was announced in Stebbins v. Riley, 45 S. Ct. 424, \n268 U.S. 137\n, cited by defendant in error. A classification for purposes of taxation must rest on some reasonable distinction. A forbidden tax cannot be enforced in order to facilitate the collection of one properly laid. Mobile, etc., R. R. v. Turnipseed, 31 S. Ct. 136, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 32 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463, discusses the doctrine of presumption.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in the result. \n\n[270 U.S. 230, 241]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.\n If the Fourteenth Amendment were now before us for the first time I should think that it ought to be construed more narrowly than it has been construed in the past. But even now it seems to me not too late to urge that in dealing with state legislation upon matters of substantive law we should avoid with great caution attempts to substitute our judgment for that of the body whose business it is in the first place, with regard to questions of domestic policy that fairly are open to debate.\n The present seems to me one of those questions. I leave aside the broader issues that might be considered and take the statute as it is written, putting the tax on the ground of an absolute presumption that gifts of a material part of the donor's estate made within six years of his death were made in contemplation of death. If the time were six months instead of six years I hardly think that the power of the State to pass the law would be denied, as the difficulty of proof would warrant making the presumption absolute; and while I should not dream of asking where the line can be drawn, since the great body of the law consists in drawing such lines, yet when you realize that you are dealing with a matter of degree you must realize that reasonable men may differ widely as to the place where the line should fall. I think that our discussion should end if we admit what I certainly believe, that reasonable men might regard six years as not too remote. Of course many gifts will be hit by the tax that were made with no contemplation of death. But the law allows a penumbra to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object in order that the object may be secured. A typical instance is the prohibition of the sale of unintoxicating malt liquors in order to make effective a prohibition of the sale of beer. The power 'is not to be denied simply because some innocent articles or transac- \n\n[270 U.S. 230, 242]\n\u00a0\n tions may be found within the proscribed class.' Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 33 S. Ct. 44, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 201\n, 204 S.; Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, 40 S. Ct. 141, \n251 U.S. 264\n, 283. In such cases, and they are familiar, the Fourteenth Amendment is invoked in vain. Later cases following the principle of Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch are Hebe Co. v. Shaw, 39 S. Ct. 125, \n248 U.S. 297\n, 303; Pierce Oil Co. v. Hope, 39 S. Ct. 172, \n248 U.S. 498\n, 500. See further Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, 22 S. Ct. 120, \n183 U.S. 238\n, 246.\n I am not prepared to say that the legislature of Wisconsin, which is better able to judge than I am, might not believe, as the Supreme Court of the State confidently affirms, that by far the larger proportion of the gifts coming under the statute actually were made in contemplation of death. I am not prepared to say that if the legislature held that belief, it might not extend the tax to gifts made within six years of death in order to make sure that its policy of taxation should not be escaped. I think that with the States as with Congress when the means are not prohibited and are calculated to effect the object we ought not to inquire into the degree of the nevessity for resorting to them. James Everard's Breweries v. Day, 44 S. Ct. 628, \n265 U.S. 545\n, 559.\n It may be worth noticing that the gifts of millions taxed in this case were made from about four years before the death to a little over one year. The statute is not called upon in its full force in order to justify this tax. If I though it necessary I should ask myself whether it should not be construed as intending to get as near to six years as it constitutionally could, and whether it would be had for a year and a month.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCOTT v. PAISLEY(1926)\nNo. 253\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Paul Donehoo and Hooper Alexander, both of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Walter McElreath, of Atlanta, Ga., for defendants in error. \n\n[271 U.S. 632, 633]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves a single question relating to the constitutional validity of section 6037 of the Georgia Code of 1910. This section, which is set forth in the margin,1 provides, in substance, that in cases where a deed has been executed conveying the legal title to land as security for the payment of a debt2-known in Georgia as a 'security deed'-and the holder of the debt upon default in payment, has reduced it to judgment, and the holder of the legal title to the land makes and places of record a quitclaim conveyance to the debtor, reinvesting him with the legal title to the land, it may thereupon be levied upon and sold in satisfaction of the judgment.\n This suit was brought by Dorothy Scott in a Superior Court of Georgia. The case made by her petition was, in substance, this: In 1919 she purchased a tract of land, subject to a security deed which the previous owner had executed to secure a note for borrowed money. Thereafter, the note not being paid at maturity, the holder, the grantee in the security deed, brought suit, without notice to her, against the grantor in the security deed, and after recovering judgment on the note, executed and placed of record a quitclaim deed to the defendant; whereupon the sheriff levied an execution on the land, and, after due advertisement, sold it at public sale in satisfaction of the \n\n[271 U.S. 632, 634]\n\u00a0\n judgment. The petitioner, while not claiming that there was any defense to the note or any irregularity or mala fides in the proceeding, alleged that the sale was void as against her on the ground that section 6037 of the Code, as applied to a case whether the grantor in a security deed conveys his interest in the land to a third person before a suit is brought to reduce the secured debt to judgment, is in conflict with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it provides that the person thus acquiring the interest of the grantor, may be divested thereof through a proceeding to which he is not a party, without notice or opportunity to be heard and make defense. The petitioner prayed that the sale be hold null and void as against her, and that she be declared the equitable owner of the land, with the right to redeem the legal title by payment of the note.\n The petition was dismissed by the Superior Court, on demurrer; and this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, per curiam. 158 Ga. 876, 124 S. E. 726. The case is here on a writ of error under section 237 of the Judical Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n The case is in a narrow compass. That, under the Georgia decisions, a sale made under a prior security deed in conformity to the provisions of section 6037, divests a purchaser from the grantor of all rights in the land is conceded. The contention that this section is unconstitutional, as applied to such a purchaser, rests, in its last analysis, upon the claim that he is entitled, as a matter of right, in accordance with settled usage and established principles of law, to notice of a proceeding to sell the land under the prior security deed and opportunity to make defense therein. We cannot sustain this contention.\n Here the holder of the secured debt was also the holder of the legal title to the property by which it was secured. In such case at least, section 6037 authorizes the holder of the secured debt, by following the procedure outlined by the \n\n[271 U.S. 632, 635]\n\u00a0\n statute, to bring the property to sale in satisfaction of the debt. Its effect is no more than if it conferred upon the holder of the secured debt a statutory power of sale, which may be treated as equivalent, in so far as the constitutional question is concerned, to an express power of sale in a mortgage or trust deed.\n Plainly the right of one who purchases property subject to a security deed, with a statutory power of sale which must be read into the deed, is no greater than that of one who purchases property subject to a mortgage or trust deed, with a contractual power of sale. The validity of such a contractual power of sale is unquestionable. In Bell Mining Co. v. Butte Bank, \n156 \nU.S. 470, 477\n, 15 S. Ct. 440, 443 (39 L. Ed. 497) this court said:\n'There is nothing in the law of mortgages, nor in the law that covers what are sometimes designated as trust deeds in the nature of mortgages, which prevents the conferring by the grantor or mortgagor in such instrument of the power to sell the premises described therein upon default in payment of the debt secured by it, and if the sale is conducted in accordance with the terms of the power, the title to the premises granted by way of security passes to the purchaser upon its consummation by conveyance.'\n\n In the absence of a specific provision to that effect, the holder of a mortgage or trust deed with power of sale, is not required to give notice of the exercise of the power to a subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer; and the validity of the sale is not affected by the fact that such notice is not given. McIver v. Smith, 11, N. C. 73, 75, 23 S. E. 971; Atkinson v. College, 54 W. Va. 32, 49, 46 S. E. 253; Grove v. Loan Co ., 17 N. D. 352, 358, 116 N. W. 345, 138 Am. St. Rep. 707;, hardwicke v. Hamilton, 121 Mo. 465, 473, 26 S. W. 342; Ostrander v. Hart (N. Y.) 30 N. E. 504. And see Watkins v. Booth, 55 Colo. 91, 94, 132 P. 1141; and Groff v. Morehouse, 51 N. Y. 503, 505. In Hardwicke v. Hamilton, supra, 473 (26 S. W. 344), the court said that 'the law imposes no duty upon a person holding a prior mortgage or deed of trust to notify one holding a similar \n\n[271 U.S. 632, 636]\n\u00a0\n subsequent or junior lien or incumbrance upon the same property of his intention to sell the property under his mortgage or deed of trust. All that is required of him is to advertise and sell the property according to the terms of the instrument, and that the sale be conducted in good faith.' And in Watkins v. Booth, supra, 94 (132 P. 1142), the court said that it was the duty of the subsequent liener 'to keep advised as to proceedings in case of the former trust deed.'\n So, a purchaser of land on which there is a prior security deed acquires his interest in the property subject to the right of the holder of the secured debt to exercise the statutory power of sale. There is no established principle of law which entitles such a purchaser to notice of the exercise of this power. And section 6037 neither deprives him of property without due process of law nor denies him the equal protection of the laws.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 6037.

Hagerty, of St. Paul, Minn., opposed.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action at law brought by the Milling Company against the Railway Company, in the District Court of the Eastern District of Missouri, to recover the sum of $3,035.73 for damages alleged to have been sustained through the negligence of the Railway Company, the initial carrier, and its connecting carriers, in the interstate transportation of rice shipped from Arkansas to New York. The Railway Company, appearing specially, filed a plea to the jurisdiction, on the ground that neither it nor the Milling Company was a resident or inhabitant of the district. This plea was sustained, without opinion, and the suit was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. This direct writ of error was allowed and the jurisdictional question certified, in February, 1925, under s 238 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St. s 1215).\n The Railway Company has interposed a motion to affirm the judgment, upon the ground that the question \n\n[270 U.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n upon which the decision depends is so unsubstantial as not to need further argument. Hodges v. Snyder, 43 S. Ct. 435, \n261 U.S. 600\n, 601. This motion must be granted.\n The declaration and the testimony heard upon the plea show that the Milling Company is a corporation organized under the laws or Texas; and that the Railway Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Illinois and Iowa, having its principal office in Chicago, but maintaining a branch office and operating a branch line within the eastern district of Missouri.\n Section 51 of the Judicial Code (Comp St. s 1033) which deals with the venue of suits originally begun in the District Courts-reenacting in part a similar provision in the Judiciary Act of 18881-provides, subject to certain exceptions not material here, that 'no civil suit shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original process of proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.' That is to say, the suit must be brought within the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, unless the general federal jurisdiction is founded upon diversity of citizenship alone, in which case it must be brought either in that district or in the district in which the plaintiff resides.\n While this provision does not limit the general jurisdiction of the District Courts, it confers a personal privilege on the defendant, which he may assert, or may waive, at his election, if sued in some other district. Lee v. Chesapeake Railway, 43 S. Ct. 230, \n260 U.S. 653\n, 655; and cases cited. If this privilege is seasonably asserted, the suit must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line, 30 S. Ct. 184, \n215 U.S. 501\n, 510; and cases cited. \n\n[270 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n It is immaterial whether the general federal jurisdiction in the present suit is founded upon diversity of citizenship alone, or whether the suit is also one arising under the laws of the United States, since neither the Milling Company nor the Railway Company is a resident of the Eastern District of Missouri; a corporation being, within the meaning of the jurisdictional statutes, a resident of the State in which it is incorporated, and not a resident or inhabitant of any other State, although it may be engaged in business within such other State. In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., 16 S. Ct. 273, \n160 U.S. 221\n, 229; Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line, supra, 509; and cases cited.\n The Milling Company contends, however, that since it might have brought the suit originally in a State court of concurrent jurisdiction within the Eastern District of Missouri, in which the Railway Company is transacting business, and the Railway Company, under the decisions in General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore Railway, 43 S. Ct. 106, \n260 U.S. 261\n, and Lee v. Chesapeake Railway, supra, might then have removed it to the District Court, this necessarily involves the conclusion that the District Court also has 'original jurisdiction' of the suit, since section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1010) provides only for the removal of suits of which the District Courts 'are given original jurisdiction.' The fallacy of this argument lies in the failure to distinguish between the general jurisdiction of the District Courts, to which section 28 relates, and the local jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, to which section 51 relates. The same contention was made, in a converse form, in the General Investment Co. Case, in which it was argued that a suit could not be removed from a state court to a district court in which, under s 51, it could not have been brought over the defendant's objection, since it was not a suit of which the District Court was given 'original jurisdiction;' and it is completely answered by the holding in that case, 43 S. Ct. 113, 26 U. S. at page 275, that the term \n\n[270 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n 'original jurisdiction' as used in section 28 refers only to the general jurisdiction conferred on the District Courts, and does not relate to the venue provision in section 51; there being 'no purpose in extending to removals the personal privilege accorded to defendants by section 51, since removals are had only at the instance of defendants.' This was approved and followed in Lee v. Chesapeake Railway, supra, 657.\n Whether the suit of originally brought in the District Court or removed from a state court, the general federal jurisdiction is the same; and the venue or local jurisdiction of the District Court over the person of the defendant is dependent in the one case as in the other upon the voluntary action of the non-resident defendant, being acquired in an original suit by his waiver of objection to the venue, and in a removed suit by his application for the removal to the District Court.\n Since the question does not require further argument, the motion of the Railway Company is granted, and the judgment of the District Court is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 25 Stat. 433, 434, c. 866. \n\n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

It brought suit on June 18, 1924, against appellants (members of the state Commerce Commission and Attorney General of the state of Illinois), to enjoin them from enforcing or attempting to enforce a schedule of rates alleged to be confiscatory, and from taking any steps or proceedings against the company by reason of the collection by it of rates and charges under another and higher schedule. A motion to dismiss the bill was overruled, and, upon the bill and attached exhibits and affidavits, appellants refusing to plead further, a permanent injunction in accordance with the prayer was granted by the lower court. The appeal in No. 670 is from that decree.\n The appeal in No. 193 is from an order previously entered, granting an interlocutory injunction. A motion to dismiss that appeal, on the ground that the order for the interlocutory injunction had become merged in the final decree, was submitted, but consideration postponed to the hearing on the merits. The motion is now granted \n\n[270 U.S. 587, 589]\n\u00a0\n and the appeal in No. 193 dismissed. Shaffer v. Carter, 40 S. Ct. 221, \n252 U.S. 37\n, 44; Pacific Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, 44 S. Ct. 553, \n265 U.S. 196\n, 205. In the cases cited, both interlocutory and permanent injunctions had been denied; here they were granted; but the record discloses no reason which prevents the same principle from being applicable.\n The averments of the bill, which, upon this record, must be taken as true, disclose the following facts:\n The operations of the company wee conducted with reasonable economy. For the year 1921, the net revenues, after payment of operating expenses and taxes, were, in round figures, $46,000; for the year 1922, there was a deficit of over $48,000; for 1923, a deficit of nearly $65,000; and a deficit for each month of the year 1924 preceding the filing of the bill. The fair value of the property, including working capital, material and supplies, and going value, was at least $3,800.000.\n In July, 1919, the predecessor in ownership of the company filed with the commission a schedule of rates covering the telephone service in question, which the commission, by final order after a hearing, approved. Prior to that order, however, the predecessor of the company had filed with the commission a second schedule of increased rates, to become effective May 1, 1920. The commission first suspended the effective date of this schedule until August 29, 1920, and then, by successive orders. until February 26, 1921, August 26, 1921, and February 23, 1922. The present company, in December, 1920, succeeded to the property and rights of its predecessor.\n During 1920, hearings were had before the commission in respect of the justice and reasonableness of the rates proposed by the second schedule, but no determination of the matter was reached. The commission, although often requested by the company to do so, thereafter failed and refused to hold further hearings, but on October 31, 1921, entered an order purporting permanently to sus- \n\n[270 U.S. 587, 590]\n\u00a0\n pend, cancel, and annul the second schedule. A hearing was applied for and denied.\n Thereupon an appeal was prosecuted to the circuit of Peoria county, and that court, on April 6, 1922, reversed the commission's order and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The commission redocketed the cause and had hearings in June, July, and September, 1922, after which the company filed its written motion requesting the commission to make effective a temporary schedule of rates pending a final determination. This motion was denied on September 28, 1922. On July 5, 1923, the company called attention to the delay in the determination of the cause, and to the fact that the revenues derived from the operation of the Peoria exchange fell short of meeting its operating expenses, and requested the commission to set the cause for an early hearing. This request was ignored, and the commission ever since has failed and refused to determine the issues in the cause, or to determine whether the rates and charges provided in the second schedule are just and reasonable, but has continued in effect the rates and charges contained in the first schedule approved by it. These rates, not only do not yield a fair return, but are insufficient to pay the operating cost of rendering telephone service to the subscribers and patrons of the exchange. Finally, it is alleged that the company is deprived of its property without due process of law, and is denied the equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.\n This conclusion, which necessarily results from the facts, is not seriously challenged, but a reversal of the decree below is sought on the ground that the company, prior to filing its bill, had not exhausted its legislative remedies. The argument seems to be that the second proposed schedule of rates, filed while the first was pending, purported to cancel the first schedule; that the order putting into \n\n[270 U.S. 587, 591]\n\u00a0\n force the rates in the first schedule was in effect a finding against the second, and put an end to it; that no legal application for an increase of rates has since been made; therefore, when the suit was brought nothing was before the commission upon which that body could lawfully act. The short answer is that the commission, after disposing of the first schedule, had uniformly treated the second as pending; had held hearings and made interlocutory orders in respect of it; had entered an order for its permanent suspension; after reversal by the state court on appeal, by which tribunal it was regarded as properly pending, had restored it to the docket for further proceedings; and had held further hearings. To say now that all this shall go for naught, and that the company must institute another and distinct proceeding, would be to put aside substance for needless ceremony.\n It thus appears that, following the decree of the state court reversing the permanent order in respect of the second schedule and directing further proceedings, the commission for a period of two years remained practically dormant, and nothing in the circumstances suggests that it had any intention of going further with the matter. For this apparent neglect on the part of the commission, no reason or excuse has been given; and it is just to say that, without explanation, its conduct evinces an entire lack of that acute appreciation of justice which should characterize a tribunal charged with the delicate and important duty of regulating the rates of a public utility with fairness to its patrons, but with a hand quick to preserve it from confiscation. Property may be as effectively taken by long-continued and unreasonable delay in putting an end to confiscatory rates as by an express affirmance of them; and where, in that respect, such a state of facts is disclosed as we have here, the injured public service company is not required indefinitely to await a decision of the rate-making tribunal before apply- \n\n[270 U.S. 587, 592]\n\u00a0\n ing to a federal court for equitable relief. The facts, which the motion to dismiss conceded, present a far stronger case for such relief than any of the cases with which this court dealt in Okla. Gas Co. v. Russell, 43 S. Ct. 353, \n261 U.S. 290\n, 293, Prendergast v. N. Y. Tel. Co., 43 S. Ct. 466, \n262 U.S. 43\n, 49; Pacific Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, supra, 204 (44 S. Ct. 553), and Banton v. Belt Line Ry., 45 S. Ct. 534, \n268 U.S. 413\n, 415\n\n\n Some complaint is made to the effect that the decree attempts to bind persons not parties to the suit, including thousands of subscribers, and to prohibit appellants from enforcing in the future any legislative remedy for excessive charges, hereafter imposed, however unreasonable they may be. As to the first branch of the complaint, it is only necessary to say that the commission represents the public and especially the subscribers, and they are properly bound by the decree. In re Engelhard & Sons Co., 34 S. Ct. 258, \n231 U.S. 646\n, 651. As to the other objection, there is nothing in the decree, rightly construed, which attempts to curtail or could curtail the legislative or rate-making powers of appellants to proceed hereafter under the state law, subject to such limitations, if any, as may be required by the doctrines of res judicata, ordinarily applicable in such cases.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

King, of Portland, Or., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER defivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal brings under review the proceedings in a much-litigated suit in equity brought to determine adverse claims based on conflicting mining leases given by a Quapaw Indian of land which was part of his allotment. The plaintiffs (appellees here) claimed under the first lease, and the defendant (appellant here) under two later leases, which taken together included the same land as the first. The relief sought by the plaintiffs was full recognition of their lease and cancellation of the others. On the original hearing the District Court, following its decisions in earlier cases, held that the plaintiffs' lease contravened restrictions imposed by laws of Congress, in that it was for a longer term than ten years, and therefore was void. Accordingly the bill was dismissed; but the Circuit Court of Appeals disapproved that ruling, reversed the decree and remanded the cause for further proceedings. 243 F. 823, 156 C. C. A. 335. On a subsequent hearing the District Court recognized the plaintiffs' lease as valid for a term of 10 years and canceled the defendant's leases to the extent of the conflict. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision (285 F. 698), and the present appeal is from the decree of affirmance.\n The plaintiffs insist that this appeal cannot be entertained, although taken prior to the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, changing federal appellate jurisdiction. But we think they misapprehend the situation.\n The suit was not within any of the classes as to which an appeal was denied by section 128 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1120), as existing before the change. Either the suit was one arising under the laws of Congress relating to the alienation and leasing of Quapaw allotments, or there was an entire absence of federal jurisdiction. In either event section 241 of \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1218), as existing before the change, permitted an appeal to this court from the final decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The only difference was that if the suit was one arising under the laws of Congress relating to the alienation and leasing of such allotments the re-examination by this court would extend to the merits, while, if there was an absence of federal jurisdiction, this court could not consider the merits, but would have to reverse the decrees of both courts below, and remand the cause to the District Court, with a direction to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction. Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 20 S. Ct. 726, \n177 U.S. 505\n, 514; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Ann Arbor R. R. Co., 20 S. Ct. 867, \n178 U.S. 239\n, 244. The act of 1925 expressly left all appeals which were then pending in this court to be disposed of under the old law.\n It therefore is necessary at the outset to determine whether this suit was one arising under the legislation relating to Quapaw allotments, or was one where there was an absence of federal jurisdiction. The established rule is that a plaintiff, suing in a federal court, must show in his pleading, affirmatively and distinctly, the existence of whatever is essential to federal jurisdiction, and, if he does not do so, the court, on having the defect called to its attention or on discovering the same, must dismiss the case, unless the defect be corrected by amendment. Norton v. Larney, 45 S. Ct. 145, \n266 U.S. 511\n.\n Here the bill disclosed that the lease under which the plaintiffs were claiming, and which they sought to have recognized, was based on the laws of Congress relating to the right of Quapaw allottees to alienate and lease their lands, and that the defendant was claiming adversely under later leases from the same lessor. It apparently was intended to show that the suit was one arising under those laws; but it fell short of showing that a real dispute over their construction and application was involved. \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n See Shulthis v. McDougal, 32 S. Ct. 704, \n225 U.S. 561\n, 569; Barnett v. Kunkel, 44 S. Ct. 254, \n264 U.S. 16\n, 19-20. In fact, as appears elsewhere in the record, that was the principal matter in dispute, and the outcome depended on its solution. The defendant's first step in the suit was to challenge the plaintiffs' right to relief by a motion to dismiss on the ground that under those laws, rightly construed and applied, the plaintiffs' lease was invalid. That challenge was sustained by the District Court, but was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal. A simple amendment of the bill, conforming its jurisdictional allegations to the fact thus brought into the record, would have corrected the defect and put in affirmative and definite form what apparently was intended in the beginning. Had the defect been called to the court's attention, leave to make the amendment could and doubtless would have been granted. But both parties proceeded as if the jurisdictional showing was sufficient; and both courts below dealt with the suit as one arising under the laws before named and proceeded to its determination accordingly. The suit was begun in 1916; the parties had two hearings in each of the courts below; and the merits were exhaustively presented. In these circumstances to amend the bill now to conform to the jurisdictional fact indisputably shown elsewhere in the record will not subject either party to any prejudice or disadvantage, but will subserve the real interests of both. This court has power to allow amendments of this character (Rev. Stat. s 954 (Comp. St. s 1591); Norton v. Larney, supra; Realty Holding Co. v. Donaldson, 45 S. Ct. 521, \n268 U.S. 398\n, and the propriety of exercising it in this instance is obvious. We therefore shall treat the bill as amended, by our leave, to show the jurisdictional fact conformably to other parts of the record. With that fact brought into the bill, there can be no doubt that there was federal jurisdiction. Hopkins v. Walker, 37 S. Ct. 711, \n244 U.S. 486\n; Norton v. Larney, supra. \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiffs insist that, as the defendant did not appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal, he is now precluded from questioning what was decided then. But the law and settled practice are otherwise. That decree was not final but only interlocutory, and so was not appealable. Nor did the defendant acquiesce in it. On the contrary, he sought to have it reconsidered by the Circuit Court of Appeals on a timely petition for rehearing, and again on the second appeal to that court. He therefore is entitled to ask, as he does in his assignments of error, that it be re-examined on this appeal. United States v. Beatty, 34 S. Ct. 392, \n232 U.S. 463\n, 466; Hamilton- Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers & Co., 36 S. Ct. 269, \n240 U.S. 251\n, 258.\n We come, then, to the merits, which center about the validity of the plaintiffs' lease.\n The lessor was a Quapaw Indian and under the guardianship of the United States. The land for which the conflicting mining leases were given was part of the allotment made to him in the distribution of the lands of his tribe. His title rested on a patent issued to him in 1896 pursuant to the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 188, 28 Stat. 907, which provided that the allotments should be inalienable for a period of 25 years from the date of the patents. The Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 72, modified that restriction to the extent of authorizing the allottees 'to lease their lands, or any part thereof, for a term not exceeding three years for farming or grazing purposes, or ten years for mining or business purposes,' and the Act of June 21, 1906, c. 3504, 34 Stat. 344, further modified the restriction to the extent of specially authorizing this allottee to alienate not exceeding 120 acres of his allotment, subject to the supervision and approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n On July 14, 1906, the allottee, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, conveyed 120 acres of his allot- \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 462]\n\u00a0\n ment to E. V. Kellett by a deed which described itself as a 'mortgage' and contained a declaration that it was made to secure the payment of a promissory note given to Kellett by the allottee and was to be null and void if the note was duly paid. In due course the note was paid, and on June 20, 1908, the land was reconveyed to the allottee by a deed which described itself as a 'release of mortgage' and contained an acknowledgment of such payment.\n The 120 acres thus conveyed to Kellett and reconveyed to the allottee is the land for which the allottee gave the mining leases in question here. They were given in 1912 and 1913, but were not approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The plaintiffs' lease was for a term exceeding 10 years, while the defendant's leases were limited to a 10-year term.\n The evidence at the final hearing took a wide range, but in no wise tended to show either that the defendant was precluded from assailing the plaintiffs' lease or that the plaintiffs were entitled to any equitable relief if their lease was originally invalid. The defendant took his leases with notice of the plaintiffs' lease, but had been proceeding with operations under his for a year or two before any effort was made to take possession or begin operations under the plaintiffs'.\n The first question on the merits is, whether the act of 1906 and the conveyance made to Kellett with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior took the land entirely out of the prior restrictions on its alienation, so that when that conveyance had served its purpose and the reconveyance to the allottee was made he was free to lease the land, and even to sell it, as he saw fit. The plaintiffs contend that the answer should be in the affirmative. Both courts below held the other way, and we think they were right. The act of 1906 did not accord to the allottee an unqualified right of alienation, \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 463]\n\u00a0\n but a right which was to be exercised only under the supervision and with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Nor was the conveyance to Kellett an absolute alienation. In terms and effect it was a conditional conveyance, called a mortgage, and the contingency which might have converted it into an absolute alienation never happened. The Secretary's approval was of that particular conveyance and of course was measured by its terms and purpose. When the condition on which the conveyance was to be null and void was performed and the reconveyance was made the situation was essentially the same as if there had been no conveyance. In substance a lien had been created with the Secretary's approval and then extinguished, thus leaving the land subject to the restrictions.\n This brings us to the defendant's contention that the plaintiffs' lease was void because given for a term exceeding 10 years. We have seen that the District Court originally so held, in keeping with its decisions in prior cases, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals, while regarding the lease as given for a term exceeding 10 years, held it good for that period and invalid as to the excess. To determine this conflict involves a consideration of the purpose and effect of the restrictive provisions in the acts of 1895 and 1897 and an examination of the terms of the lease.\n The act of 1895 declared broadly that the allotments should be inalienable for 25 years from the date of the patents, and the act of 1897 relaxed that restriction to the extent only of permitting the allottees to lease not exceeding a term of 3 years for farming or grazing purposes, or 10 years for mining or business purposes. Thus it was beyond the power of any allottee, on his own volition, to grant any interest in his allotment during the 25-year period otherwise than by a lease permitted \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 464]\n\u00a0\n by the act of 1897. United States v. Noble, 35 S. Ct. 532, \n237 U.S. 74\n, 80. The plaintiffs' lease-it originally ran to one Hopper and was assigned by him to them-was given during that period and was for mining purposes. The consideration recited was $1 in hand paid and the lessee's covenants to begin operations within 90 days or pay a stated rent, to conduct the operations with diligence and to pay royalties of 5 per cent. of the market value of the minerals removed. The term of the lease was stated to be '10 years' from its date, but with the qualification that, if minerals were found in paying quantities, 'the privilege of operating' under the agreed terms should 'continue so long as' minerals could be produced in such quantities after the expiration of the 10 years, and that, if operations were not begun within 90 days, the lessee should pay, in lieu of such work, five cents an acre yearly for each acre in the lease 'so long as' he desired 'to operate and hold the same.' The parties rightly agree, as the courts below did, that these provisions, if taken together, show that the lease was not limited to a term of 10 years, but was to continue after that period so long as minerals could be produced with profit.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the provisions just described were so far independent and severable that the one declaring that the term was to be 10 years should be given effect, and those declaring that it was to continue beyond that period should be rejected as invalid, and the lease sustained for a 10-year term. We think that conclusion overlooks the nature and purpose of the restrictions in the acts of 1895 and 1897. In adopting the restrictions Congress was not imposing restraints on a class of persons who were sui juris, but on Indians who were being conducted from a state of dependent wardship to one of full emancipation and needed to be safeguarded against their own improvidence during the period of transition. The purpose of the restrictions \n\n[270 U.S. 456, 465]\n\u00a0\n was to give the needed protection, and they should be construed in keeping with that purpose. The permission to give short leases was in the nature of an exception to the comprehensive restraint already imposed and hardly could have been intended to give any effect or recognition to leases negotiated and made in disregard of that limited permission. A lease not within that permission evidently was intended to be left where it was before-within the general prohibition and invalid. Otherwise the allottees would be exposed to much of the evil intended to be excluded; for of course many intending lessees would be disposed to obtain leases for long terms if no other risk was run than that of having their rights held down to the maximum admissible term, if the allottee or the United States should discover the situation and take proceedings to correct it. Such a view would almost certainly result in beclouding the title of the allottees and in bringing the land into needless litigation to their detriment. We think the better view is that where an allottee undertakes to negotiate a lease for a forbidden term he enters a field in which he must be regarded as without capacity or authority to negotiate or act and that the resulting lease is void. See Taylor v. Parker, 35 S. Ct. 22, \n235 U.S. 42\n; Sage v. Hampe, 35 S. Ct. 94, \n235 \nU.S. 99, 105\n, 35 S. Ct. 94.\n This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider other objections urged against the plaintiffs' lease. It follows that the first decree of the District Court was right and the subsequent decrees were wrong.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC. CO. v. U.S.(1926)\nNo. 239\nArgued: October 6, 1926Decided: November 22, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. R. Harr and Charles H. Bates, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[272 U.S. 445, 446]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover for the transportation over its lines of several shipments of military impedimenta, made by the War Department in 1916 and 1917. The court allowed recovery for five items and denied recovery for certain others, which are alone the subject of controversy here. This court granted certiorari, \n270 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 46 S. Ct. 242; section 3(b) Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 939 (Comp. St.  1172a).\n Some of the lines of petitioner were constructed with the aid of land grants by the United States under acts of Congress requiring land-aided railroads to transport troops, munitions of war, and property of the United States at rates not exceeding 50 per cent. of those paid by private schippers for the same kind of service. Sections 11, 18, Act July 27, 1866, c. 278, 14 Stat. 297, 299. See also appropriation acts for army transportation for years 1916-1917. Act March 4, 1915, c. 143, 38 Stat. 1076, 1077; Act Aug. 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 633, 634.\n At the time of the transportation, the tariff in force on petitioner's road available to the public at large, Western Classification, 54 I. C. C. No. 12, did not include any of the items of military impedimenta here involved. But petitioner then had on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission a special tariff applicable to such items when carried by passenger train or expedited service, without deduction for shipments made over land-aided or land grant roads.\n Petitioner presented its bills for the expedited service in transporting the items controverted, on the basis of the rates fixed by this tariff, without deduction. The accounting officers of the government allowed the claim at a \n\n[272 U.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n lower rate corresponding to the schedule embraced in the Western Classification applicable to emigrant movables carried by ordinary freight trains, and payment thus computed with land grant deductions was received by petitioner under protest.\n The Court of Claims held that the rate on emigrant movables was inapplicable and that petitioner did not establish a lawful rate by leaving a special tariff schedule with the Interstate Commerce Commission, since there is no provision of law requiring or permitting the filing of tariffs applicable only to government transportation. But it is argued here as it was below, that since there was no rate open to the public applicable to the items involving expedited service, the shipments by representatives of the War Department, following the filing of the special tariff for that service, must be taken to establish an implied agreement to pay the special tariff rate. And further, since the agreed rate was not open to the public, there could be, by the very terms of the applicable acts of Congress, no land grant deductions.\n This reasoning omits a step essential to the imposition of a contractual liability upon the government, for it points to no fact found from which assent of the shipper to the special tariff rate could be inferred. The Court of Claims found that there was no express agreement that the shipments were based upon the special tariff, and that there was no proof that the contracting of ficers had any knowledge of the tariff at the time of the shipments. Obviously they cannot be held to have yielded assent to a tariff of which they were ignorant. A basis for a contract implied in fact to pay the rate charged is therefore wanting. In this respect the case differs from those in which a recovery was allowed where there was no lawful tariff and the shipments were made with knowledge on the part of the government representatives of the rates published by the carrier. Compare Yazoo & Miss. Valley R. R. Co. v. United States, 54 Ct. Cl. 165.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n Nor were the representatives of the War Department chargeable as a matter of law with knowledge, which they did not in fact possess, of a tariff which was not required to be filed. The ordinary consequences that attend the filing of a schedule of rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission as demanded or permitted by statute (cf. Texas & Pacific Ry. v.

CO. v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 805\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William R. Harr and Charles H. Bates, both of Washington, D. C., for Southern Pac. Co.\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Southern Pacific Company filed a petition in the Court of Claims seeking to recover compensation for the transportation of impedimenta carried with troop trains of the United States. It asked for a judgment of $ 42,734.97. After a hearing on the evidence, the Court of Claims gave judgment for the company in the sum of $498.38. This judgment was entered May 11, 1925. On July 10, 1925, the plaintiff filed motion for a new trial, which on October 26, 1925, the court denied. On October 28, 1925, the company filed a petition for an appeal, which was allowed by the Court of Claims on November 2, 1925\n\n\n A motion is now made by the United States to dismiss the appeal on the ground that this court was deprived of jurisdiction to entertain appeals from the Court of \n\n[270 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n Claims by the act entitled 'an act to amend the Judicial Code, and to further define the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and of the Supreme Court, and for other purposes,' approved February 13, 1925 ( chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936). Section 14 of that act provides:\n'This act shall take effect three months after its approval; but it shall not affect cases then pending in the Supreme Court, nor shall it affect the right to a review, or the mode or time for exercising the same, as respects any judgment or decree entered prior to the date when it takes effect.'\n\n The act took effect May 13, 1925. The judgment from which an appeal is sought was entered May 11, 1925, but the effect of that judgment as a final judgment was suspended by the motion for a new trial duly filed, within the rules of the court, on July 10, 1925. This motion was not finally denied until October 26, 1925, and not until then did the judgment become subject to review in this court. The general principle is well established by many decisions of this court, some of which are cited in Morse v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 151\n, 46 S. Ct. 241, just decided. That the operation of the Act of February 13, 1925, does not change the application of the principle appears clearly from the case of Andrews v. Virginian Railway, 39 S. Ct. 101, \n248 U.S. 272\n. In that case, a suit for damages for wrongful death was heard in a state circuit court of Virginia, and a judgment rendered in favor of the defendant, June 16, 1916. A petition for writ of error to review the judgment was presented to the Court of Appeals and finally denied on November 13, 1916. On November 27, 1916, a petition was presented to the presiding judge of the state circuit court for the allowance of a writ of error from this court to review the judgment of that court of June 16, 1916, which was allowed, and the case was brought here. Between the time of the rendition of the judgment in the state circuit Court and the denial of the petition for writ of error by the Court of Appeals of Virginia, November 13, 1916, the Act of Congress of \n\n[270 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, and been approved and became operative October 6, 1916. In form the judgment to which the writ of error was addressed was rendered on June 16, 1916, before the operation of the act of the Congress, and it was argued that the judgment was outside its provisions. The question considered by the court was thus whether the judgment was a final judgment at the date named, or became so only by the state Court of Appeals declining in the exercise of its discretion to take jurisdiction on November 13, 1916, after the passage of the new act of Congress. It was held that though the action of the Court of Appeals was the mere exercise of gracious or discretionary power, neither imperative nor obligatory, the judgment of the circuit court could not be regarded as final for the purpose of review in this court until after the exercise by the Court of Appeals of this discretion. It was therefore held that the judgment of the state circuit court, though rendered before the approval of the Act of September 6, 1916, which took effect October 6, 1916, must be regarded as not final with reference to the review by this court until the refusal of the Court of Appeals of Virginia to consider the case on November 13, 1916. And so in this case. While the judgment to which the appeal was allowed was actually entered two days before the Act of Congress of February 13, 1925, went into effect, the subsequent motion for a new trial of July 10, 1925, seasonably filed, suspended the judgment of the Court of Claims as a final judgment for purposes of review until the denial of the motion for new trial in October, 1925. This court, therefore, has no jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a judgment acquiring finality only in October after the going into effect of the Act of February 13, 1925, which limited the method of review by this court of final judgments in the Court of Claims to writs of certiorari after May 13, 1925. The motion to dismiss the appeal must be granted. In the \n\n[270 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n meantime, and in due time, a petition for certiorari was filed, which the court has considered, and does now grant, and the cause is set for hearing on the summary docket for the 4th day of October next. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPERRY GYROSCOPE CO. v.

C., amici curiae. \n\n[271 U.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Mc,REYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant brought suit against the Engineering Company, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, for damages, profits, etc., on account of the manufacture by it of gyroscopic compasses, covered by patents, for the United States; also for an injunction against further infringements. The allegation which demands special consideration follows:\n'That the defendant, well knowing the premises, but with intent to injure the plaintiff, to interfere with its business, and to deprive it of the profits derived and to be derived from making, using, and selling said inventions, has, within the Eastern District of New York, and without the license or consent of plaintiff, but against its positive protest, made a number of gyroscopic compasses for and sold them to the United States Navy Department under contract with the said Navy Department, subsequent to the dates of said patents and within six years next preceding the filing of this complaint, to wit, during the years 1918 to 1923, all in infringement of the aforesaid letters patent, and that defendant is preparing and threatening to infringe said patents more extensively by the manufacture of said infringing apparatus for and its sale to the United States Navy Department under contract with the said Department and thus to inflict further injury, damage, and loss upon the plaintiff; but to what extent the defendant has profited by reason of the aforesaid infringement plaintiff is ignorant and cannot set forth, and prays an account thereof.'\n\n The contract with the United States is not set forth. Whether it undertook to protect them against claims arising under appellant's patents, or whether the compasses were delivered before or after July 1, 1918, or whether the arrangement necessarily involved an infringement of the patents, does not appear. \n\n[271 U.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n The trial court dismissed the bill for lack of jurisdiction, and granted this direct appeal December 30, 1924. Such appeals were permitted by section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), 'in any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, in which case the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision.' We are now concerned only with the power of the trial court to decide the controversy revealed by the record.\n Under section 24, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), District Courts have original jurisdiction:\n'Seventh. Of all suits at law or in equity arising under the patent, the copyright, and the trade-mark laws.'\n\n Appellant charged that the Engineering Company had infringed its patents by making and selling compasses to the United States, under contract, during the years 1918 to 1923, and intended further to infringe by continuing so to do. It asked for damages and an injunction. But for the allegation that the inventions were made and sold under such a contract, this would be but the ordinary patent suit. And so the real question presented is whether that allegation was enough to deprive the District Court of the jurisdiction plainly conferred by section 24.\n Act of June 25, 1910, c. 423, 36 Stat. 851 (Comp. St.  9465), 'to provide additional protection for owners of patents,' directed:\n'That whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used by the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use the same, such owner may recover reasonable compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims.'\n\n The Act of July 1, 1918, c. 114, 40 Stat. 704, 705 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9465), amended the act of 1910 to read:\n'That whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used or manufactured by or for the United States without \n\n[271 U.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same, such owner's remedy shall be by suit against the United States in the Court of Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture: Provided, however, that said Court of Claims shall not entertain a suit or award compensation under the provisions of this act where the claim for compensation is based on the use or manufacture by or for the United States of any article heretofore owned, leased, used by, or in the possession of the United States: Provided further, that in any such suit the United States may avail itself of any and all defenses, general or special, that might be pleaded by a defendant in an action for infringement, as set forth in title sixty of the Revised Statutes, or otherwise: And provided further, that the benefits of this act shall not inure to any patentee who, when he makes such claim, is in the employment or service of the government of the United States, or the assignee of any such patentee; nor shall this act apply to any device discovered or invented by such employee during the time of his employment or service.'\n\n The argument is that the act of 1918 deprived the District Court of jurisdiction over the controversy between the present parties, because it limited the patent owner's remedy, under circumstances like those here disclosed, to a suit against the United States in the Court of Claims. But we think this contention goes to the merits of the matter, and not merely to the question of jurisdiction. The true intent and meaning of the statute is not free from doubt; but certainly there is nothing therein which shows any clear purpose to take away the power to decide. It became the duty of the court below to consider and determine whether, in the circumstances stated, appellee was relieved of liability and permitted by the statute to do what otherwise would have constituted a \n\n[271 U.S. 232, 236]\n\u00a0\n violation of appellant's rights. There was jurisdiction. The judgment below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. See The Pesaro, \n255 \nU.S. 216\n, 41 S. Ct. 308; Smith v. Apple, \n264 \nU.S. 274\n, 44 S. Ct. 311; Smyth v. Asphalt Belt Ry., \n267 \nU.S. 326\n, 45 S. Ct. 242.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST.

Cocke, of Birmingham, Ala., Forney Johnston, of Washington, D. C., and E. T. Miller, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Messrs. G. R. Harsh, of Birmingham, Ala. (Harsh & Harsh, of Birmingham, Ala., on the brief), for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent's intestate was employed in interstate and intrastate commerce by the petitioner, as a car inspector in its yards in Birmingham, Ala. During the railroad shopmen's strike, on the night of August 3, 1922, decedent, while returning from work to his home, on a street car, was shot to death by strikers who fired upon him, a fellow workman and a duputy sheriff employed by petitioner to guard decedent and his companion. Respondent brought suit in the circuit court of Jefferson county, Alabama, to recover for intestate's death, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665). The cause was removed to the District Court for Northern Alabama on the gound of diversity of citizenship. Judgment for the plaintiff, the respondent here, was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 3 F.(2d) 882. This court granted certiorari. \n267 \nU.S. 589\n, 45 S. Ct. 354.\n The trial judge withdrew from the jury the question whether the guard was negligent in the performance of his duty, but left it to them to say whether upon the evidence, defendant was employed in interstate commerce at the time and place of the shooting; whether there was a duty of due care on the part of the defendant to protect decedent from violence by strikers while going from his place of employment to his home; and whether the failure of respondent to send more than a single guard to protect decedent was negligence causing his death. The instructions so given, and the refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant, are assigned as error.\n Petitioner argues that the evidence did not warrant the submission of any of these questions to the jury, and \n\n[271 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n contends, among other objections, that there is no evidence of a breach of any duty owing by petitioner to respondent. The question of law thus raised goes directly to the right to recover under the act upon which the action was based. See St. Louis Iron M. Ry. v. McWhirter, \n229 \nU.S. 265, 277\n, 33 S. Ct. 858\n\n\n It is not contended that any duty growing out of the relationship of employer and employee required the employer to guard the employee against violence by strikers. Compare Davis v. Green, \n260 \nU.S. 349, 351\n, 43 S. Ct. 123; Manwell v. Durst, 178 Cal. 752, 174 P. 881, 1 A. L. R. 669; Roebuck v. Railway Co., 99 Kan. 544, 162 P. 1153, L. R. A. 1917E, 741; Lewis v. Taylor Coal Co., 112 Ky. 845, 66 S. W. 1044, 57 L. R. A. 447; Rourke's Case, 237 Mass. 360, 129 N. E. 603, 13 A. L. R. 546; Matter of Lampert v. Siemons, 235 N. Y. 311, 139 N. E. 278. Nor is there any evidence of such an undertaking in the contract of employment. Hence the duty, if it existed, must be predicated upon the voluntary assumption of it by petitioner.\n Taken in the aspect most favorable to respondent, the evidence shows that decedent was first employed on the Monday preceding his death, which occurred on Thursday. The strike had been in progress for some time, and 6 or 7 employees were on strike in the yard where decedent was employed. The number of strikers elsewhere does not appear. Seven guards were employed by petitioner in the yard where decedent worked, and from 50 to 75 were employed elsewhere in the city. There was some evidence that, during decedent's employment, guards had been provided for employees while at work during the day, and to accompany decedent and some others to and from their homes. There was no evidence that petitioner had ever furnished decedent or any other employee with more than one guard in going to or from work, or any other evidence from which it could be inferred that petitioner had undertaken, or held itself out as undertaking, to furnish more protection to the decedent or its other workmen than it actually did furnish. \n\n[271 U.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n The respondent here asserts that the defendant, having assumed to do something, should have done more. But the bare fact that the employer voluntarily provided some protection against an apprehended danger, by undertaking to do something which involved no special knowledge or skill, can give rise to no inference that it undertook to do more. Respondent therefore relies on the breach of a duty which does not exist at common law, and of whose genesis in fact it offers no evidence.\n There is a similar absence of evidence of negligent failure by petitioners to fulfill this supposed duty of protection. The burden of proving negligence rested on the respondent. Patton v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658\n, 21 S. Ct. 275. But whether a supply of guards sufficient to meet the emergency was obtainable, what demands were made upon them, and whether there were other guards available for the particular journey when the decedent was killed, are questions on which the record is silent.\n Nor is there evidence from which the jury might infer that petitioner's failure to provide an additional guard or guards, was the proximate cause of decedent's death. Whether one or more additional guards would have prevented the killing is in the highest degree speculative. The undisputed evidence is that the shooting was done by one or more of three men standing of the rear platform of the car. They had come there after decedent and his companions had seated themselves in the car. Without warning they fired a volley into the car, and fled. Decedent and his guard were armed, but had no opportunity to defend themselves. On such a state of facts the jury should not have been permitted to conjecture what might have happened if an additional guard had been present. See Patton v. Texas & Pacific Ry., supra; Reading Co. v. Boyer (C. C. A.) 6 F.(2d) 185; Midland Valley R. R. v. Fulgham, 181 F. 91, 104 C. C. A. 151, L. R. A. 1917E, 1; Laidlaw v. Sage, 158 N. Y. 73, 52 N. E. 679, 44 L. R. A. 216. \n\n[271 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n The evidence must at least point to the essential fact which the jury is required to find in order to sustain the verdict.\n We need not inquire whether decedent was employed in interstate commerce at the time of his death, or whether the rule laid down in Erie R. R. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 170\n, 37 S. Ct. 556, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 662, can be extended, as the court below held, so as to support the judgment of the District Court.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF ARKANSAS v.

The order is a certificate that present and future public convenience and necessity permit the abandonment by the Colorado & Southern Railway Company, six months thereafter, of a branch line located wholly in that state. The certificate was issued under Interstate Commerce Act,  1, pars. 18-20, as amended by Transportation Act 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 477 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563).\n The company is a Colorado corporation. It owns and operates in intrastate and interstate commerce a railroad system located partly in Colorado and partly in other states. The branch was constructed under the authority of Colorado and was acquired by the company under its authority. The line is narrow gauge. It is now physi- \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 160]\n\u00a0\n cally detached from other lines of the company; but it is operated in both intrastate and interstate commerce as a part of the system by means of connections with other railroads. The certificate was granted on the ground that the local conditions are such that public convenience and necessity do not require continued operation, that for years operation of the branch had resulted in large deficits, that future operation would likewise result in large deficits, that the operating results of the branch are reflected in the company's accounts, that it would have to make good the deficits incurred in operating the branch, and that thus continued operation would constitute an undue burden upon interstate commerce.

Before any hearing thereon, the state moved that the proceeding be dismissed on the ground, among others, that, as the branch was wholly intrastate, the Commission was without jurisdiction of the application. This objection was overruled. Thereafter the state opposed, on the merits, the granting of the certificate. The case was first heard before division 4 of the Commission on exceptions filed by the company to the examiner's proposed report.

On September 24, 1923, an order was entered that the certificate issue. 82 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 310. A hearing before the full Commission was then sought by the state and the other protestants. Compare United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 281\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. The \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 161]\n\u00a0\n request was granted. On February 11, 1924, the order was affirmed with the modification that the certificate should not take effect until six months from that date. Abandonment of Branch Line by C. & S. Ry., 86 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 393. The effective date of the certificate was later extended to September 11, 1924, and finally to October 11, 1924. 94 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 657, 661.\n Meanwhile, this suit had been begun. The Commission and the company intervened as defendants. On August 19, 1924, a decree dismissing the bill on the merits was entered, upon final hearing, without opinion. A motion for a suspension of the order of the Commission pending an appeal was denied. The case is here on direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (Comp. St.  998). The order is assailed as void insofar as it authorizes abandonment and discontinuance of operation in intrastate traffic. The remedy pursued is the appropriate one. See Texas v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204\n, 42 S. Ct. 281.\n First. The main contention of the state is that the Commission lacks power to authorize the company to abandon, as respects intrastate traffic, a part of its line lying wholly within the state. The argument is this: While a railroad cannot, in the absence of express statutory provision or contract, be compelled by a state to continue operating its lines at a loss when there is no reasonable prospect of future profit, and may therefore, without such consent, abandon all lines within the state ( Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 396\n, 40 S. Ct. 183; Bullock v. Florida, \n254 \nU.S. 513, 520\n, 41 S. Ct. 193; Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 44 S. Ct. 247), it has no right to abandon a part of the lines, merely because operation will be attended by pecuniary loss, and still continue to enjoy the privilege of operating other parts within the state ( Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n242 \nU.S. 603\n, 37 S. Ct. 234; Fort Smith Light & Traction Co. v. Bourland, \n267 \nU.S. 330\n, 45 S. Ct. 249). The \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 162]\n\u00a0\n charter of the Colorado & Southern is a contract with the state. By accepting the charter, the company assumed the obligation of providing intrastate service on every part of its line within the state. Colorado & Southern Ry. v. Railroad Commission, 54 Colo. 64, 92-93, 129 P. 506. The extent and character of this service is subject to regulation by the state. The inherent power of a state to regulate intrastate traffic by requiring the railroad to operate every part of its line, like its power to order a particular service, is, of course, subject to the limitation that the order must not be unreasonable. But the fact that operation of the branch will necessarily result in financial loss, would, in no event, be more than an important circumstance bearing upon the reasonableness of the state's order requiring the service. In the case at bar no question of the reasonableness of the state's action can arise, because the state has not issued any order; it has merely protested against the Commission's releasing this Colorado corporation from the primary duty voluntarily assumed of maintaining some service on the branch. This the Commission cannot do as respects intrastate commerce. Transportation Act 1920 did not purport to take from the state its powers to control intrastate commerce. Nor did it confer upon the Commission power to release a corporation chartered by the state from its primary obligation to furnish service. If paragraph 18 of section 1 should be construed as authorizing the Commission to do so without the consent of the state, the provision would be unconstitutional. Compare Texas v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204, 217\n, 42 S. Ct. 281. Such is the argument.\n The argument rests upon a misconception of the nature of the power exercised by the Commission in authorizing abandonment under paragraphs 18- 20. The certificate issues not primarily to protect the railroad, but to protect interstate commerce from undue burdens or discrimination. The Commission by its order removes an ob- \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 163]\n\u00a0\n struction which would otherwise prevent the railroad from performing its federal duty. Prejudice to interstate commerce may be effected in many ways. One way is by excessive expenditures from the common fund in the local interest, thereby lessening the ability of the carrier properly to serve interstate commerce. Expenditures in the local interest may be so large as to compel the carrier to raise reasonable interstate rates, or to abstain from making an appropriate reduction of such rates, or to curtail interstate service, or to forego facilities needed in interstate commerce. Likewise, excessive local expenditures may so weaken the financial condition of the carrier as to raise the cost of securing capital required for providing transportation facilities used in the service, and thus compel an increase of rates. Such depletion of the common resources in the local interest may conceivably be effected by continued operation of an intrastate branch in intrastate commerce at a large loss.\n The sole objective of paragraphs 18-20 is the regulation of interstate commerce. Control is exerted over intrastate commerce only because such control is a necessary incident of freeing interstate commerce from the unreasonable burdens, obstructions or unjust discrimination which is found to result from operating a branch at a large loss. Congress has power to authorize abandonment, because the state's power to regulate and promote intrastate commerce may not be exercised in such a way as to prejudice interstate commerce. The exertion of the federal power to prevent prejudice to interstate commerce so arising from the operation of a branch in intrastate commerce is similar to that exerted when a state establishes intrastate rates so low that intrastate traffic does not bear its fair share of the cost of the service (Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318\n, 43 S. Ct. 583), or when the \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 164]\n\u00a0\n state authorities seek to compel the erection of a union station so expensive as unduly to deplete the financial resources of the carriers ( Railroad road Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376), or when one railroad seeks to construct an intrastate branch line, which will deplete its own financial resources or those of another interstate carrier (Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 270, U. S. 266, 46 S. Ct. 263, decided March 1, 1926). The jurisdiction exercised by the Commission in these cases is in essence that which was invoked in The Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833, a power to prevent unjust preference to particular intrastate shippers or localities at the demonstrated expense of interstate commerce. But there is a broader basis for federal control.\n This railroad, like most others, was chartered to engage in both intrastate and interstate commerce. The same instrumentality serves both. The two services are inextricably intertwined. The extent and manner in which one is performed, necessarily affects the performance of the other. Efficient performance of either is dependent upon the efficient performance of the transportation system as a whole. Congress did not, in the respect here under consideration, assume exclusive regulation of the common instrumentality, as it did in respect to safety coupling devices. Compare Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S. Ct. 2; Atlantic Coast Line v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280, 293\n, 34 S. Ct. 829. It expressly excluded from federal control that part of the railroad which consists of 'spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks located ... wholly within one state.' See Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263, decided March 1, 1926. But as to the rest of every railroad line used in interstate commerce, Congress reserved the full authority to determine whether, and to what extent, public convenience and necessity permit of abandonment.\n Recognition of the effect upon interstate commerce of the use of the same instrumentality in intrastate com- \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 165]\n\u00a0\n merce is manifested also in other provisions of Transportation Act 1920. It is a reason for the exclusive jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by section 20a over the issuance of securities. Compare Venner v. Michigan Central R. R. Co. (No. 190) \n271 \nU.S. 127\n, 46 S. Ct. 444, decided April 26, 1926. It is the ground upon which the validity of the recapture clause, as applied to surplus profits derived from intrastate operations, was sustained in Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 485\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472. It is the justification for those provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act which require carriers engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce to render accounts of all their business. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S. Ct. 436. And upon it rests likewise the power exerted by this court in setting aside the state regulations involved in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n248 \nU.S. 67\n, 39 S. Ct. 24, and St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n254 \nU.S. 535\n, 41 S. Ct. 192. See, also, United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S. Ct. 445; Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229; Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S. Ct. 470.\n The exercise of federal power in authorizing abandonment is not an invasion of a field reserved to the state. The obligation assumed by the corporation under its charter of providing intrastate service on every part of its line within the state is subordinate to the performance by it of its federal duty, also assumed, efficiently to render transportation services in interstate commerce. There is no contention here that the railroad by its charter agreed in terms to continue to operate this branch regardless of loss. Compare Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 79\n, 44 S. Ct. 247. But even explicit charter provisions must yield to the paramount power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 601\n, 42 S. Ct. 239. Because the same instrumentality serves both, Congress has power to assume not only some control but paramount control insofar as interstate \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 166]\n\u00a0\n commerce is involved. It may determine to what extent and in what manner intrastate service must be subordinated in order that interstate service may be adequately rendered. The power to make the determination inheres in the United States as an incident of its power over interstate commerce. The making of this determination involves an exercise of judgment upon the facts of the particular case. The authority to find the facts and to exercise thereon the judgment whether abandonment is consistent with public convenience and necessity, Congress conferred upon the Commission.\n Second. The state contends further that the order is void, so far as it relates to intrastate traffic, because essential findings were not made and, also, because essential findings made were not supported by evidence. The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S. Ct. 317. The findings alleged to be essential and lacking are that by continued operation of the branch interstate or foreign commerce will be discriminated against, or that the company will be prevented from earning a fair return on the value of its properties as a whole, or that the entire intrastate business in Colorado will not earn such a return upon the property used in conducting that business. The other objections urged are that the evidence of past operating deficits on the branch, which include both interstate and intrastate traffic, does not support the finding that operation in intrastate traffic alone will result in like deficits, and that the decision of the Commission was improperly influenced by an offer to lease the line to the protestants at a nominal rental. All the evidence before the Commission was introduced below and is, in substance, incorporated in the record on appeal. Both classes of objections must, therefore, be considered. New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 203\n, 43 S. Ct. 270.\n Before examining the specific objections, the nature of the determination to be made by the Commission upon an application for leave to abandon should be further con- \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 167]\n\u00a0\n sidered. As every projected abandonment of any part of a railroad engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce may conceivably involve a conflict between state and national interests, the consent of the Commission must be obtained by the railroad in every case. To ensure due consideration of the local interests, Congress provided that a copy of every application must be promptly filed with the Governor of the state directly affected, that notice of the application must be published in some local newspaper, and that the appropriate state authorities should have 'the right to make before the Commission such representations as they may deem just and proper for preserving the rights and interests of their people and the states, respectively, involved in such proceedings.' In practice, representatives of state regulatory bodies sit, sometimes, with the representatives of the Commission at hearings upon the application for a certificate. Occasionally, the Commission leaves the preliminary enquiry to the state body; and always consideration is given by the Commission to the representations of the state authorities. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n While the constitutional basis of authority to issue the certificate of abandonment is the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, the act does not make issuance of the certificate conditional upon a finding that continued operation will result in discrimination against \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 168]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce, or that it will result in a denial of just compensation for the use in intrastate commerce of the property of the carrier within the state, or that it will result in a denial of such compensation for the property within the state used in commerce intrastate and interstate. The sole test prescribed is that abandonment be consistent with public necessity and convenience. In determining whether it is, the Commission must have regard to the needs of both intrastate and interstate commerce; for it was a purpose of Transportation Act 1920 to establish and maintain adequate service for both. Wisconsin Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 585\n, 587 S., 589, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 485\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472; United States v. Village of Hubbard, \n266 \nU.S. 474\n, 45 S. Ct. 160. The benefit to one of the abandonment must be weighed against the inconvenience and loss to which the other will thereby be subjected. Conversely, the benefits to particular communities and commerce of continued operation must be weighed against the burden thereby imposed upon other commerce. Compare Proposed Abandonment by Boston & Maine R. R., 105 Interst. Com. Com'n. R. 13. 16. The result of this weighing-the judgment of the Commission-is expressed by its order granting or denying the certificate.\n It is rare that the application for leave to abandon actually involves a conflict between the needs of interstate and of intrastate commerce. In many cases, it is clear that the extent of the whole traffic, the degree of dependence of the communities directly affected upon the particular means of transportation, and other attendant conditions, are such that the carrier may not justly be required to continue to bear the financial loss necessarily entailed by operation. \n2\n in some cases, although the vol- \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 169]\n\u00a0\n ume of the whole traffic is small, the question is whether abandonment may justly be permitted, in view of the fact that it would subject the communities directly affected to serious injury while continued operation would impose a relatively light burden upon a prosperous carrier. \n3\n The problem and the process are substantially the same in these cases as where the conflict is between the needs of intrastate and of interstate commerce. Whatever the precise nature of these conflicting needs, the determination is made upon a balancing of the respective interests-the effort being to decide what fairness to all concerned demands. In that balancing, the fact of demonstrated prejudice to interstate commerce and the absence of earnings adequate to afford reasonable compensation are, of course, relevant and may often be controlling. But the act does not make issuance of the certificate dependent upon a specific finding to that effect.\n An examination of the extensive record and of the three opinions of the Commission convinces us that no relevant fact was ignored, that there was ample evidence to support the facts found, and that the judgment of the Commission was not improperly influenced by the offer to lease the line to the protestants at a nominal rental. The case at bar is unlike Texas v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204\n, 42 S. Ct. 281. There the railroad was permitted to be relieved only from continuing operations in interstate commerce. It was being operated independently, and not as a branch of any railroad engaged in interstate commerce. \n\n[271 U.S. 153, 170]\n\u00a0\n Losses incurred in its operation would not be reflected in the accounts of any interstate carrier; and no interstate carrier would have had to make good deficits so incurred. Its continued operation could not burden or prejudice interstate commerce, for the Commission in issuing its certificate had adjudged that public necessity and convenience did not demand the continuance of its interstate services.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] From the enactment of Transportation Act 1920 to February 18, 1926, the number of applications for abandonment acted on was 191. Of these, 9 were dismissed by the Commission for want of jurisdiction; 11 were denied; 170 were granted. Of these 170, only 6 were granted contrary to the recommendation of the state authorities. Of the 47 cases in which state authorities made specific recommendations, the Commission acted in 38 in accordance therewith. In 2 cases in which the state recommended postponement, the Commission denied the application. In one, in which the state recommended denial of the application, the Commission postponed decision pending the result of operation during a test period. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, e. g., Abandonment, etc., by Southern Pacific Co. 72 Interst.

Soper, the United States District Judge for Maryland, directing him to remand an indictment for murder, found in the circuit court for \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 21]\n\u00a0\n Harford county, Maryland, against four prohibition agents and their chauffeur, which was removed to the United States District Court under section 33 of the Judicial Code, as amended August 23, 1916, 39 Stat. 532, c. 399 (Comp. St. s 1015). The text of the amended section, in so far as it is material here, is set out in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The indictment, found February 10, 1925, charged as follows:\n'The jurors of the state of Maryland, for the body of Harford county, do on their oath present that Wilton L. Stevens, John M. Barton, Robert D. Ford, E. Franklin Ely, and William Trabing, late of Harford county aforesaid, on the nineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and twenty-four, at the county aforesaid, feloniously, willfully, and of their deliberately premeditated malice aforethought did kill and murder Lawrence Wenger, contrary to the form of the act of assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government, and dignity of the state.' \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 22]\n\u00a0\n The defendants were arrested, and on February 11, 1925, filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in which they averred that they were federal prohibition agents, except Trabing, who was their chauffeur, and was assisting them and was acting under the authority of the prohibition director, and that the act or acts done by Trabing, as chauffeur and helper, as well as by the other defendants, at the time when they were alleged to have been guilty of the murder of Lawrence Wenger, which charge they all denied, were done in the discharge of their official duties as prohibition agents, and as officers of the internal revenue in the discharge of their duty. Thereupon an order of removal, together with a writ of certiorari, and habeas corpus cum causa, pursuant to section 33, was made by Judge Soper of the District Court. On March 12th, the state of Maryland, by its Attorney General and the state's attorney for Harford county, appeared specially and made a motion to quash the writ and rescind the order. On the 17th of May, the cause came on for hearing on the motion to quash, and, the defendants having applied for leave of court to amend the petition, it was granted, and an amended petition was filed. After setting out the indictment, the third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs of the amended petition were as follows:\n\n'3. That the acts alleged to have been done by the petitioner William Trabing are alleged to have been done at a time when he was engaged in the discharge of his duties while acting under and by authority of Federal Prohibition Director Edmund Budnitz and Federal Prohibition Officers Robert D. Ford, John M. Barton, Wilson L. Stevens, and E. Franklin Ely, as aforesaid, while the said officers were engaged in the discharge of their official duties as prohibition officers in making and attempting to make an investigation concerning a violation \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 23]\n\u00a0\n of the National Prohibition Act and other internal revenue laws and while reporting and preparing to report the results of said investigation and in protecting himself and the said officers of the internal revenue in the discharge of his and their duty as set out in paragraph 4 below.\n\n'4. That the acts alleged to have been done by the petitioners Robert D. Ford, John M. Barton, Wilton L. Stevens, and E. Franklin Ely are alleged to have been done at a time when they were engaged in the discharge of their official duties as federal prohibition officers, and in making and attempting to make an investigation concerning a violation of the National Prohibition Act and other internal revenue laws, and in reporting the results of said investigation, and in protecting themselves in the discharge of their duty as follows:\n\n'That on November nineteenth, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, your petitioners were directed by Maryland Federal Prohibition Director Edmund Budnitz to investigate the alleged unlawful distillation of intoxicating liquor on a farm known as the Harry Carver farm situated approximately three miles from the village of Madonna, about twelve miles northwest from Bel Air, Maryland, which said property was then unoccupied. Your petitioners reached the said farm premises shortly after midday on November nineteenth, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, and discovered there in a secluded wooded valley and swamp materials for an illicit distilling operation, to wit, nine empty mash boxes, three fifty-gallon metal drums, a fifty-gallon condenser, about one thousand pounds of rye meal in bags, a lighted fire, and men's working clothes. Your petitioners thereupon concealed themselves in woods and shrubbery nearby the still site and shortly thereafter became aware of the approach of a number of men bringing with them a still. Your petitioners thereupon made their presence known to the men who were approaching, and the men immediately dropped \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 24]\n\u00a0\n the still and fled; and though your petitioners pursued them across the fields, no one of the fleeing men was overtaken or arrested. Thereupon your petitioners returned to the still site, destroyed the materials before mentioned which constituted the unlawful distilling plant, and started to return to their car, which had been left some distance from the still site, for the purpose of returning to Baltimore to report to the office of the Maryland federal prohibition director concerning the results of their investigation, when they discovered a man, whom they afterwards learned to be one Lawrence Wenger, mortally wounded and lying beside the path along which they were walking, some 400 or 500 yards from the still site and in a direction opposite to that from which the unknown men had approached and towards which they fled. Whereupon your petitioners carried the wounded man to their car and took him to Jarrettsville, Maryland, for medical treatment, but, finding none there available, proceeded with all speed to Bel Air, where they sought out in turn Drs. Richardson, Sappington and Archer, without success, and finally placed the said Lawrence Wenger in charge of Dr. Van Bibber, who pronounced him dead. Your petitioners then, acting under the advice of the said Dr. Van Bibber, removed the body of the said Lawrence Wenger to the undertaking establishment of Dean & Foster in Bel Air. Your petitioners then proceeded to the state's attorney's office in Bel Air and related the facts aforesaid to the state's attorney, whereupon, on being informed by them that your petitioners Robert D. Ford, John M. Barton, Wilton L. Stevens, and E. Franklin Ely were prohibition officers, and that your petitioner William Trabing was employed by the federal prohibition director as their chauffeur, they were placed under arrest by the sheriff of Harford county at the instance of the state's attorney and were confined in the Harford county jail until the following morning, Novem- \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 25]\n\u00a0\n ber twentieth, nineteen hundred and twenty-four. On the morning of November twentieth, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, your petitioners were taken by the sheriff and state's attorney, in company with a number of men who that afternoon served upon the coroner's jury mentioned in the indictment, and in company with two Baltimore city police headquarters detectives, to the scene of their investigation of the previous day. They related the facts concerning their investigation of the unlawful distilling operation and their finding of the said Lawrence Wenger on November nineteenth, and then and there went over the scene of the said occurrences, relating freely and without reservation the events which took place November nineteenth, in accordance with their duty as investigating and reporting officers of the federal government and in compliance with their duties as federal prohibition officers. Likewise on the afternoon of November twentieth your petitioners were called before the coroner's inquest heretofore described in the indictment, and freely and without reservation in accordance with their duty as investigating and reporting officers of the federal government and acting under the direction of the Maryland federal prohibition director, related the facts aforementioned. And thereupon they were again placed in the Harford county jail and held for action of the Harford county grand jury until their release on bail upon the evening of November twentieth, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, at the instance of the United States attorney for the district of Maryland acting on their behalf.\n\n'5. That the said criminal prosecution was commenced in the manner following:\n\n'A presentment against your petitioners was returned in the circuit court for Harford county, February ninth, nineteen hundred and twenty- five, following which presentment the state of Maryland, by the state's attorney \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 26]\n\u00a0\n for Harford county, prosecuted and sued forth out of the circuit court for Harford county a writ of the state of Maryland of capias ad respondendum against your petitioners, to which there was no return by the sheriff of Harford county, whereupon the indictment heretofore set forth was returned.\n\n'The said indictment is now pending in the circuit court for Harford county and is a criminal prosecution on account of acts alleged to have been done by your petitioners at a time when they were engaged in the performance of their duties as federal prohibition officers and chauffeur for federal prohibition officers as set forth in the aforegoing paragraphs.\n\n'Wherefore your petitioners pray that the said suit may be removed from the circuit court for Harford county, aforesaid, to this honorable court, and that writs of certiorari and habeas corpus cum causa may issue for that purpose pursuant to the statute of the United States in such case made and provided. U. S. Compiled Statutes, s 1015, being Judicial Code, s 33, as amended Act Aug. 23, 1916, c. 399; Prohibition Act, tit. 2, s 23.'\n\n A motion to quash the amended petition. April 11, 1925, was based on the ground, among others, that the allegations of the amended petition did not disclose a state of facts entitling the defendants to have the writ issue, or to have the charge against them removed. On May 5, 1925, Judge Soper denied the motion to quash, and directed that the order of court removing the indictment be ratified and confirmed. On the same day the following stipulation was entered into by the parties:\n'It is stipulated by and between the parties hereto that Robert D. Ford, John M. Barton, Wilton L. Stevens, and E. Franklin Ely, during the month of November in the year 1924, and prior to said time, and at the time of the matters and facts charged in the indictment in the \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 27]\n\u00a0\n circuit court for Harford county, were federal prohibition officers, holding a commission under the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and countersigned by the federal prohibition commissioner, in the form following, that is to say:\n\n\"This certifies that-is hereby employed as a federal prohibition officer to act under the authority of and to enforce the National Prohibition Act and acts supplemental thereto and all internal revenue laws, relating to the manufacture, sale, transportation, control, and taxation of intoxicating liquors, and he is hereby authorized to execute and perform all the duties delegated to such officers by law.'\n\n'And that William Trabing was, at the time of the acts alleged in the indictment in the circuit court for Harford county, a chauffeur of the Reliable Transfer Company, engaged and employed by Edmund Budnitz, federal prohibition director of the state of Maryland, in the capacity of chauffeur for the prohibition agents above named.'\n\n The state of Maryland applied to this court for leave to file its petition for mandamus, in which it set forth fully the facts as above stated, including, as exhibits, the petition for removal, the amended petition for removal, its motion to quash, the stipulation, and the orders of the District Court. This court, granting leave, issued a rule against Judge Soper to show cause why the writ of mandamus should not issue in accordance with the prayer of the state.\n Judge Soper, in his answer to the rule, recited the facts of the record as already given, said that the District Court was of opinion that the petitioners were entitled to removal under section 33 of the Code as revenue officers, and that, if not as revenue officers, as agents of the Commissioner by virtue of section 28 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 10138 1\/2 o); that a prosecution had been commenced against the \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 28]\n\u00a0\n petitioners on account of acts done under color of their office and of the revenue and prohibition laws of the United States, notwithstanding that the petitioners did not admit having caused the death of Wenger, and that it had adjudged that it possessed ample jurisdiction to order the removal and to try the case; and he therefore asked that the rule be discharged and that the petition of the state be dismissed.\n It is objected on behalf of the respondent that this is not a proper case for mandamus, that whether the facts averred in the amended petition come within the requirement of section 33 of the Judicial Code is a question within the regular judicial function of the District Court to decide, and that this court should not interfere thus prematurely with its exercise.\n Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n, Virginia v. Paul, \n148 \nU.S. 107\n, 13 S. Ct. 536, and Kentucky v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 1\n, 26 S. Ct. 387, 5 Ann. Cas. 692, were cases in which criminal prosecutions by a state, removed to a federal court under asserted compliance with federal statutes, were ordered remanded by writ of mandamus. The Attorney General of Maryland relies on them to show that the writ may issue to test the legality of the removal in all criminal cases. On behalf of the United States, it is pointed out that these cases differ from the one before us, in that in the former the state prosecution had not reached a stage, or was not of a character in which, under the language of the statute, removal could be had at all, and so the federal court was wholly without jurisdiction. The writ in those cases was justified by the court because of the gross abuse of discretion of the lower court, its clear lack of jurisdiction, and the absence of any other remedy. Ex parte Harding, \n219 U.S. 363\n, at page 373, 31 S. Ct. 324, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 392. In this case the facts averred show the prosecution to be of the class and character in which removal is permitted by section 33, and there is no lack of jurisdiction or abuse of discretion, and the only issue made is on the interpreta- \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 29]\n\u00a0\n tion of the facts and the application of the section, an issue clearly within the judicial jurisdiction of a district court.\n Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy which is issued by this court under Rev. Stats. s 688, now Judicial Code, s 234 (Comp. St. s 1211), to courts of the United States in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, and in civil cases does not lie to compel a reversal of a decision, either interlocutory or final, made in the exercise of a lawful jurisdiction, especially where in regular course the decision may be reviewed upon a writ of error or appeal.

Paul, Virginia v. Rives, and Kentucky v. Powers, and this case. But we do not think that those differences should prevent the issue of the mandamus here. In respect of the removal of state prosecutions, there should be a more liberal use of mandamus than in removal of civil cases. We exercise a sound judicial discretion in granting or withholding the writ. It may be 'in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law.' Rev. Stats. s 688; Ex parte Bardley, 7 Wall. 364, 376; Virginia v. Rives, supra, at page 323, separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field, at page 329. It is granted in analogy to the intervention of equity to secure justice in the absence of any other adequate remedy. Duncan Townsite v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 308, 312\n, 38 S. Ct. 99. In the case before us, and in all state prosecutions removed under section 33, the jurisdiction of the courts of a state to try offenses against its own laws and in violation of its own peace and dignity is wrested from it by the order of an inferior federal court. The state by its petition for man- \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 30]\n\u00a0\n damus becomes a suitor at the bar of this court to challenge the legality of the inferior court's action. Conceding the validity of the exceptional use of the national supremacy in a proper case, it seeks by this writ to test its propriety here. Except by the issue of mandamus, it is without an opportunity to invoke the decision of this court upon the issue it would raise.\n The order of the United States District Judge refusing to remand is not open to review on a writ of error, and a judgment of acquittal in that court is final. United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n, 12 S. Ct. 609; Virginia v. Paul, supra, at page 122 (13 S. Ct. 536). The fact that the United States District Court may be proceeding in the exercise of a lawful jurisdiction should not, under such exceptional circumstances, prevent this court from extending to the state the extraordinary remedy.\n We come, then, to the sufficiency of the amended petition for removal under section 33 of the Judicial Code to justify the District Court in denying the motion to remand.\n The first objection made by the state to the removal is that prohibition agents cannot have the benefit of section 33, because they are not officers 'appointed under or acting by authority of any revenue law of the United States,' as provided in the section. The four defendants are admitted to have been acting under commissions issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 'empowering them to enforce the National Prohibition Acts and acts supplemental thereto, and all internal revenue laws, relating to the manufacture, sale, transportation, control, and taxation of intoxicating liquors.' The fifth defendant, Trabing, it is admitted, was acting as a chauffeur and helper to the four officers under their orders and by direction of the prohibition director for the state. It is not denied on behalf of the state that he has the same right to the benefit of section 33 as they. Davis v. South Carolina, \n107 \nU.S. 597\n, 2 S. Ct. 636. \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 31]\n\u00a0\n The Act of November 23, 1921, 42 Stat. 223, c. 134, s 5 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 10138 4\/5 c), known as the Willis-Campbell Law, amending the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 307, c. 85), provides that:\n'All laws in regard to the manufacture and taxation of and traffic in intoxicating liquor, and all penalties for violations of such laws that were in force when the National Prohibition Act was enacted, shall be and continue in force, as to both beverage and nonbeverage liquor, except such provisions of such laws as are directly in conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act or of this act.'\n\n Rev. Stats. s 3282 (Comp. St. s 6022), forbidding fermenting of mash or wort, or the making of spirits therefrom in any other than a distillery authorized by law, or by a duly authorized distiller, and punishing its violation by fine and imprisonment, is not in conflict with anything in the Prohibition Act. The Willis-Campbell Act thus makes clear the criminality of such an act under the revenue laws. United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477\n, 43 S. Ct. 197. In searching for the still for the purpose of preventing the violation of law, the prohibition agents in this case were therefore acting under the authority of the revenue laws.\n More than this, they were brought within the application of section 33 by the provision of section 28, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, providing that the commissioner, his assistants, agents and inspectors and all other officers of the United States whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws, shall have all the power and protection in the enforcement of the act, or any provisions thereof, which is conferred by law for the enforcement of existing laws relating to the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor under the law of the United States. We have no doubt that the word 'protection' was inserted for the purpose of giving to officers and persons acting under the authority of the National Prohibition Act in enforcement of its provisions, the same protection of a trial in a federal \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 32]\n\u00a0\n court of state prosecutions as is accorded to revenue officers under section 33.\n Section 33 was derived from section 643 of the Revised Statutes, which in turn was derived from the Act of July 13, 1866, 14 Stat. 171, c. 184, s 67, and the Act of June 30, 1864, 13 Stat. 241, c. 173, s 50. These acts extend the Act of March 2, 1833, 4 Stat. 633, c. 57, s 3, applying to officers engaged in collection of customs duties to those engaged in the collection of internal revenue. People's United States Bank v. Goodwin (C. C.) 162 F. 937, 939; Tennessee v. Davis, \n100 U.S. 257\n, 267. The act of 1833 was enacted in the days of attempted nullification of national customs revenue laws in South Carolina, and was during the Civil War extended to those charged with collecting the internal revenue. Congress not without reason assumed that the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act was likely to encounter in some quarters a lack of sympathy and even obstruction, and sought by making section 33 applicable to defeat the use of local courts to embarrass those who must execute it. The constitutional validity of the section rests on the right and power of the United States to secure the efficient execution of its laws and to prevent interference therewith, due to possible local prejudice, by state prosecutions instituted against federal officers in enforcing such laws, by removal of the prosecutions to a federal court to avoid the effect of such prejudice. Tennessee v. Davis, supra.\n Do the facts disclosed by the amended petition for removal bring the defendants within section 33? The state insists that they are insufficient because they do not show that the defendants committed the act of homicide upon which the indictment is founded. The case of Illinois v. Fletcher (C. C.) 22 F. 776, seems to hold that a revenue officer can take advantage of the statute and secure a trial in a federal court only by admitting that he did the act for which he is prosecuted. We think this too \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 33]\n\u00a0\n narrow a construction of the section. Cleveland, Columbus, etc., Railroad v. McClung, \n119 \nU.S. 454, 461\n, 7 S. Ct. 262.\n The prosecution to be removed under the section must have been instituted 'on account of' acts done by the defendant as a federal officer under color of his office or of the revenue or prohibition law. There must be causal connection between what the officer has done under asserted official authority and the state prosecution. It must appear that the prosecution of him for whatever offense has arisen out of the acts done by him under color of federal authority and in enforcement of federal law, and he must by direct averment exclude the possibility that it was based on acts or conduct of his, not justified by his federal duty. But the statute does not require that the prosecution must be for the very acts which the officer admits to have been done by him under federal authority. It is enough that his acts or his presence at the place in performance of his official duty constitute the basis, though mistaken or false, of the state prosecution.\n Suppose that the prosecution of the officer for murder was commenced merely on account of the presence of the officer in discharge of his duties in enforcing the law, at or near the place of the killing under circumstances casting suspicion of guilt on him. He may not even know who did the killing, and yet his being there and his official activities may have led to the indictment. He may certainly claim the protection of the statute on the ground that the prosecution was commenced against him 'on account of' his doing his duty as an officer under color of such a law without being able to allege that he committed the very act for which he is indicted. It is enough if the prosecution for murder is based on or arises out of the acts he did under authority of federal law in the discharge of his duty and only by reason thereof. \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 34]\n\u00a0\n In invoking the protection of a trial of a state offense in a federal court under section 33, a federal officer abandons his right to refuse to testify because accused of crime, at least to the extent of disclosing in his application for removal all the circumstances known to him out of which the prosecution arose. The defense he is to make is that of his immunity from punishment by the state, because what he did was justified by his duty under the federal law, and because he did nothing else on which the prosecution could be based. He must establish fully and fairly this defense by the allegations of his petition for removal before the federal court can properly grant it. It is incumbent on him, conformably to the rules of good pleading, to make the case on which he relies, so that the court may be fully advised and the state may take issue on a motion to remand. Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. Cockrell, \n232 \nU.S. 146, 151\n, 152 S.,1 and cases cited. See, also, concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Field in Virginia v. Rives, supra, at page 332, and Hanford v. Davies, \n163 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 16 S. Ct. 1051.\n We think that the averments of the amended petition in this case are not sufficiently informing and specific to make a case for removal under section 33. We have set forth the account the defendants gave in their amended petition of what they saw and did, but the only averments important in directly connecting the prosecution with their acts are at the opening and close of their petition. They refer to the death of Wenger only by incorporating the indictment in the petition, and then say that 'the acts (i. e. the killing of Wenger) alleged to have been done by petitioners Robert D. Ford, John M. Barton, Wilton L. Stevens, and E. Franklin Ely are alleged to have been at a time when they were engaged in the discharge of their official duties as federal prohibition officers, and in making and attempting to make an investigation concerning a violation of the National Prohibition Act and other internal \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 35]\n\u00a0\n revenue laws and in reporting the results of said investigation, and in protecting themselves in the discharge of their duty.' The amended petition closes with the statement that the indictment 'is a criminal prosecution on account of acts alleged to have been done by your petitioners at a time when they were engaged in the performance of their duties as federal prohibition officers and chauffeur for federal prohibition officers as set forth in the foregoing paragraphs.'\n These averments amount to hardly more than to say that the homicide on account of which they are charged with murder was at a time when they were engaged in performing their official duties. They do not negative the possibility that they were doing other acts than official acts at the time and on this occasion, or make it clear and specific that whatever was done by them leading to the prosecution was done under color of their federal official duty. They do not allege what was the nature of Wenger's fatal wound, whether gunshot or otherwise, whether they had seen him among those who brought the still and fled, or whether they heard, or took part in any shooting. They do not say what they did, if anything, in pursuit of the fugitives. It is true that in their narration of the facts, their nearness to the place of Wenger's killing and their effort to arrest the persons about to engage in alleged distilling are circumstances possibly suggesting the reason and occasion for the criminal charge and the prosecution against them. But they should do more than this in order to satisfy the statute. In order to justify so exceptional a procedure, the person seeking the benefit of it should be candid, specific and positive in explaining his relation to the transaction growing out of which he has been indicated, and in showing that his relation to it was confined to his acts as an officer. As the defendants in their statement have not clearly fulfilled this requirement, we must grant the writ of mandamus, \n\n[270 U.S. 9, 36]\n\u00a0\n directing the District Judge to remand the indictment and prosecution. Should the District Judge deem it proper to allow another amendment to the petition for removal, by which the averments necessary to bring the case within section 33 are supplied, he will be at liberty to do so. Otherwise the prosecution is to be remanded as upon a peremptory writ. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 33.

SOPER(1926)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Federal prohibition enforcement officers and their chauffeur, voluntarily testifying before coroner concerning death of one whom they found mortally wounded near place of illicit liquor manufacture, held to have acted as individuals, and, when indicted for obstructing justice by false testimony, not entitled to have the prosecution transferred to federal court, under Judicial Code, s 33 (Comp. St. s 1015).\n Messrs. Herbert Levy and Thomas H. Robinson, both of Baltimore, Md., for the State of Maryland. \n\n[270 U.S. 36, 37]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for mandamus by the state of Maryland to require the District Court of the United States for that state to remand to the state circuit court for Harford county an indictment by the grand jury of that county for obstructing justice of the state by false testimony. The indictment had been removed from the circuit court to the federal court in asserted compliance with section 33 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1015 ). The amended petition of removal, upon the sufficiency of which the application of section 33 turns, discloses the same state of facts as that shown in the mandamus case between the same parties just decided. The indictment charges that the same defendants as were there charged with murder conspired in a hearing before a justice of the peace of Harford county, acting as the coroner with a jury and engaged in the official duty of inquiring into the manner of the death of Lawrence Wenger on November 20, 1924, to deceive the coroner and jury by withholding the facts concerning Wenger's death, and falsely asserting ignorance thereof, in order to induce them to return a false and erroneous verdict, and thus to obstruct justice in violation of a criminal statute of Maryland. This testimony was given the day after Wenger's death while the defendants were under arrest on the charge of murder, and the indictment in this case was returned at the same time as the indictment for murder. \n\n[270 U.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n The amended petition of defendants for removal avers that 'on the afternoon of November 20th your petitioners were called before the coroner's inquest heretofore described in the indictment, and freely and without reservation, in accordance with their duty as investigating and reporting officers of the federal government and acting under the direction of the Maryland federal prohibition director, related the facts before mentioned; and thereupon they were again placed in the Harford county jail and held for the action of the Harford county grand jury.' The amended petition concludes with the statement that 'the said indictment is now pending in the circuit court for Harford county, and is a criminal prosecution on account of acts alleged to have been done by your petitioners at a time when they were engaged in the performance of their duties as federal prohibition officers and chauffeur for federal prohibition officers, as set forth in the aforegoing paragraphs.'\n The record in this case is in all respects like that in the case just decided, except that the prosecution is for obstruction of justice. The orders of the federal District Court, the other proceedings, the stipulation as to evidence, the petition for mandamus, and the return of Judge Soper to the rule issued on the petition of the state for mandamus are all similar.\n Counsel for the state of Maryland argue that the accused officers were in no sense acting in their official capacity when engaged in the alleged conspiracy to deceive the coroner; that their duty had been discharged when they destroyed the still; that their subsequent reports of what had happened to their federal superiors are not the subject of this prosecution; that the indictments for conspiracy and perjury were based, not on acts which the defendants had done in pursuance of federal law and in discharge of their duty to the federal government, but on testimony given by them under their obligations to \n\n[270 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n the state as individuals and for which they were detained in jail. To this it is answered, on behalf of the United States, as follows:\n'But how did the officers come to be in jail? If they had not been engaged in the performance of their duties as federal officers, they would never have been there. When they found Wenger's body, they had just come from performing their duty, and were on their way back to report officially to their superior. At that time they were still acting in their official capacity. United States v. Gleason, 1 Woolw. 128, Fed. Cas. No. 15216. In immediately seeking for a physician, and in reporting Wenger's death at once to the state's attorney, they were doing the only reasonable act which could be expected of them, both as public officers and as private citizens. But, as their petition alleges, the state's attorney, on being informed by them that your petitioners ... were prohibition officers, ordered them to be at once placed under arrest.\n\n'If they had not discovered Wenger and reported his murder, there would have been no need for them to testify before the coroner's jury, and there would have been no occasion for any charge of conspiracy. The two charges, it is submitted, are so closely interrelated that they can not properly be separated. The charge of murder gave rise to the charge of conspiracy. If the former charge is removable to the federal court, it is submitted that the latter should be removable also.\n\n'Considerable danger would be involved in a contrary holding. If charges of murder alleged to have been committed by federal officers are removable, and charges of conspiracy and similar offenses are not removable, an obvious expedient would suggest itself. In localities where the administration of particular federal laws is unpopular, federal officers need no longer be dragged before hostile state tribunals on charges such as murder, on which they may successfully claim removal and plead self-defense. \n\n[270 U.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n The charge can readily be altered to 'conspiracy,' or to some other crime, which the accused officers deny having committed at all, but on which it will be clear that removal cannot be obtained. The actual charge will serve merely as a cloak to obtain the desired end, namely, incarceration of an unpopular officer. In this way the functions of the federal government may be harassed or impeded, and its officers withdrawn from their duty, as effectively as by prosecutions for homicide actually committed in self-defense. This method may easily become as effective as out-and-out nullification of federal laws.'\n\n We may concede that the reports of the officers to their federal superiors were within their official duty, but it does not follow that whatever happened between the events at the place of the still and the return to Baltimore to make report was within the protection of their official immunity. It depends upon the nature of that which they did in the interval. The right of the state to inquire into suspected crime in its territory justifies the use of investigation by its officers and the questioning of suspected persons under oath. The response of the federal officer under suspicion to such questioning is not an act of his under federal authority.\n Of course one can state a case in which acts not expressly authorized by the federal statutes are such an inevitable outgrowth of the officer's discharge of his federal duty and so closely interrelated with it as necessarily to be within the protection of section 33.\n Thus removals of prosecution on account of acts done in enforcement of the revenue or prohibition laws or under color of them properly include those for acts committed by a federal officer in defense of his life, threatened while enforcing or attempting to enforce the law. Such acts of defense are really part of the exercise of his official authority They are necessary to make the enforcement effective. \n\n[270 U.S. 36, 43]\n\u00a0\n This is as far as the case of United States v. Gleason, supra, 25 Fed. Cas. 1335, No. 15,216, cited by government counsel, would by analogy carry us. That was a charge to the jury by Mr. Justice Miller in the trial of a federal criminal indictment under a statute punishing the obstruction of a federal officer in arresting an army deserter which caused the death of the officer. The justice said to the jury that, if the officer having been obstructed was retreating with a view of making other arrangements to perform his duty of arresting, he was still employed in arresting deserters. It was not necessary, to render his killing an offense against the United States, that he should be engaged in the immediate duty of arrest. 'The purpose of the law is to protect the life of the person so employed, and this protection continues so long as he is engaged in a service necessary and proper to that employment.' But the indictment which is here removed is for acts not thus closely connected with, and included in, the attempted enforcement of the federal law.\n The defendants when called upon to testify before the coroner were not obliged by federal law to do so. Indeed, even under state law they might have stood mute, because the proceeding was one in which they were accused of crime. They themselves show that they voluntarily made the statements upon which these indictments were founded. While of course it was natural that, if not guilty, they should have responded fully and freely to all questions as to their knowledge of the transaction with a view of showing their innocence, nevertheless their evidence was not in performance of their duty as officers of the United States.\n In answer to the suggestion that our construction of section 33 and our failure to sustain the right of removal in the case before us will permit evilly minded persons to evade the useful operation of section 33, we can only say that if prosecutions of this kind come to be used to obstruct \n\n[270 U.S. 36, 44]\n\u00a0\n seriously the enforcement of federal laws, it will be for Congress in its discretion to amend section 33, so that the words 'on account of' shall be enlarged to mean that any prosecution of a federal officer for any state offense which can be shown by evidence to have had its motive in a wish to hinder him in the enforcement of federal law, may be removed for trial to the proper federal court. We are not now considering or intimating whether such an enlargement would be valid; but what we wish to be understood as deciding is that the present language of section 33 cannot be broadened by fair construction to give it such a meaning. These were not prosecutions therefore commenced on account of acts done by these defendants solely in pursuance of their federal authority. With the statute as it is, they cannot have the protection of a trial in the federal court, however natural their denials under oath of inculpating circumstances. As the indictment in this case was not removable under section 33, the mandamus to the judge of the District Court to remand it to the circuit court for Harford county, Md., must be made absolute. The writ need not issue, however, as Judge Soper's return indicates that he will act upon an expression of our views. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MD. v.

It differs in that here the indictment which was removed from the circuit court for Harford county, Maryland, to the District Court of the United States for Maryland, was an indictment against E. Franklin Ely for perjury, in the inquiry made by the coroner into the circumstances of the death of Wenger; it being charged that, when it was material whether he had seen Lawrence Wenger at the time he (Ely), as a government officer, lay concealed and hidden, and watched the bringing of the still, he falsely stated he had not seen Wenger. In all other respects the proceedings were quite like those in the case just decided, and on the principles laid down in that case we must hold that there was no ground for removing the prosecution of Ely for perjury, and that the mandamus to require the remanding of the removal should be made absolute. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MICHIGAN v. STATE OF WISCONSIN(1926)\nNo. 19\nArgued: January 5, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Andrew B. Dougherty, Atty. Gen., Carl D. Mosier, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Merdith P. Sawyer, of Menominee, Mich., for the State of Michigan.\n Messrs. Herman L. Ekern, Atty. Gen., and R. M. Rieser, of Madison, Wis., for the State of Wisconsin.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an original suit in equity, brought in this court to determine the boundary between the states of Michigan and Wisconsin from the mouth of the Montreal river at Lake Superior to the ship channel entrance from Lake Michigan into Green Bay. By the Enabling Act of June 15, 1836, c. 99, 5 Stat. 49, under which Michigan became a state in 1837, 5 Stat. 144, c. 6, this boundary is described as follows:\n'... Thence (the mouth of the Montreal river) through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal, to the middle of the Lake of the Desert; thence, in a direct line to the nearest head water of the Menominee river; thence, through the middle of that fork of the said river first touched by the said line, to the main channel of the said Menominee river; thence, down the centre of the main channel of the same, to the centre of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan; thence, through the centre of the most usual ship channel of the said bay to the middle of Lake Michigan. ...' Section 2.\n\n The Territory of Wisconsin was created by an Act of April 20, 1836, c. 54, 5 Stat. 10, 11, and this boundary is there described in the reverse direction:\n\n\n[270 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n ... 'To a point in the middle of said lake (Michigan), and opposite the main channel of Green Bay, and through said channel and Green Bay to the mouth of the Menominee river; thence through the middle of the main channel of said river, to that head of said river nearest to the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line, to the middle of said lake; thence through the middle of the main channel of the Montreal river, to its mouth . ...' Section 1.\n The only difference between the two descriptions is that in the former the call is for the 'most usual ship channel,' while in the latter it is for the 'main channel,' of Green Bay. In the Wisconsin Enabling Act of August 6, 1846, c. 89, 9 Stat. 56, 57, under which the state was admitted by the Act of May 29, 1848, c. 50, 9 Stat. 233, this boundary is described as:\n'... Running with the boundary line of the state of Michigan, through Lake Michigan, Green Bay, to the mouth of the Menominee river; thence up the channel of said river to the Brule river; thence up said last mentioned river to Lake Brule ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brule in a direct line to the centre of the channel between Middle and South Islands, in the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line to the headwaters of the Montreal river, as marked upon the survey made by Captain Cramm; thence down the main channel of the Montreal river to the middle of Lake Superior.\n\n'... That, to prevent all disputes in reference to the jurisdiction of islands in the said Brule and Menominee rivers, the line be so run as to include within the jurisdiction of Michigan all the islands in the Brule and Menominee rivers (to the extent in which said rivers are adopted as a boundary), down to, and inclusive of, the Quinnesec Falls of the Menominee; and from thence the line shall be so run as to include within the jurisdiction of Wisconsin all the islands in the Menominee river, from the falls aforesaid down to the junction of said river \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n with Green Bay: Provided, that the adjustment of boundary, as fixed in this act, between Wisconsin and Michigan shall not be binding on Congress, unless the same shall be ratified by the state of Michigan on or before the first day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight.' Sections 1, 2.\n\n The history of events leading up to the present controversy extends over a period of 80 years, and the evidence, including a multitude of official and other maps and documents, constitutes a long and involved record. The case is reviewed in voluminous, but well-prepared briefs and was helpfully argued at the bar. This mass of material we have examined with the care properly due the importance of the issue and the high character of the parties litigant; but much of it may be put aside as unnecessary for final consideration, since the determination we have reached depends upon a comparatively few decisive facts and circumstances, either undisputed or clearly established.\n In the briefs and oral arguments the boundary is divided for purposes of convenient discussion into three distinct sections, namely: (1) The Montreal river section, extending from the mouth of the Montreal river to the Lake of the Desert, and thence to the headwaters of the Menominee river (or to Lake Brule ); (2) the Menominee river section, extending from its headwaters (or from Lake Brule ) to Green Bay; and (3) the Green Bay section, extending from the last-named point through the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay to Lake Michigan. Although our ultimate determination in respect of these three sections rests upon the same basic principle, they are so distinct in their physical characteristics and in respect of much of the evidence peculiarly applicable to each apart from the others that our conclusions will be more clearly formulated and better understood if we adopt the same plan in the examination of the questions which follow. \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n The Montreal River Section.\n If we had before us nothing but the language of the Michigan Enabling Act, describing this section of the boundary as extending 'through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal, to the middle of the Lake of the Desert,' it would not be easy to avoid the conclusion that it was the understanding of the framers of the act that the river Montreal could be followed to a connection with the Lake of the Desert; and that such was the understanding clearly appears from the record. Moreover, maps in existence at the time of the passage of the act, which were available and must have been known to the framers, depict the Lake of the Desert (or, as it is there called, Lac Vieux Desert) as the source of the Montreal river. But the locality at that time was a wilderness, the topography of which was practically unknown, except to the aboriginal inhabitants and the occasional voyageur, trapper, and hunter, and, following the date of the passage of the act, it was found that in fact the headwaters of the Montreal did not extend to the Lake of the Desert, but fell short of it some 50 or 60 miles. It was subsequently revealed by exploration and surveys that the river from its mouth follows a winding course for several miles eastwardly, and then divides into two branches, the westerly branch to its head following a southerly direction and the easterly branch a southeasterly direction. The westerly branch finds its source in a body of water called Island Lake. The easterly branch finally divides into two small tributaries, called, respectively, the Balsam and Pine. The lake, which in our opinion is sufficiently identified as the one which Congress meant by its call for the Lake of the Desert, is several miles nearer to the point of junction of these tributaries than it is to any point on the westerly branch. Much evidence was submitted on behalf of Michigan in an effort \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n to demonstrate that the westerly branch of the river was the larger stream, and was in fact, and was understood by Congress to be, the upper portion of that river, and that Island Lake, at the head of the westerly branch, was intended by the designation 'Lake of the Desert.' We think it fairly appears, to the contrary, that the easterly, and not the westerly, branch was, and was understood to be, the upper portion of the Montreal; but a positive conclusion to that effect is not necessary, since our judgment turns upon other and independent considerations.\n In 1838, an act of Congress, 5 Stat. 244, c. 101, directed that the boundary line in question be 'surveyed, marked, and designated,' and by a later act, approved July 20, 1840, 5 Stat. 404, 407, c. 54, the making of the survey was placed under the superintendence of the War Department. Pursuant to this legislation, one Capt. Cram was directed to make the survey, which he proceeded to do, completing it in 1841. He submitted two reports to Congress, from which it appears that the description of the boundary 'through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal, to the middle of the Lake of the Desert,' was an impossible one, and that the line could not be run in complete accordance with it. Carrying out as nearly as possible what he conceived to be the intention of Congress, he fixed the headwaters of the Montreal at the junction of the Balsam and Pine, at a point designated and marked 'Astronomical Station No. 2,' from which point the line was extended in a direct course to the Lake of the Desert. His reports embodies data for the information of Congress, and recommended that action be taken by that body definitely to establish the boundary.\n Capt. Cram's first report is dated December, 1840. He begins it with an analysis of the description we have quoted from the Michigan Enabling Act, from which he infers that Congress supposed that the Lake of the Desert \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n discharged itself into the Montreal river; that somewhere between Lake Superior and Green Bay there was a known lake bearing that name, since the description is 'to the middle of the Lake of the Desert'; that of the various headwaters discharging into the Menominee river one would be found nearest to the Lake of the Desert, since that is the call; and that this would be found to be a branch of the Menominee, and not a lake, since the description is, 'through the middle of that fork ... first touched by the said line.'\n Following these inferences, he states that the Lake of the Desert has no connection either with the Montreal river or with the Menominee, but constitutes the principal head of the Wisconsin river. His conclusion is that additional action on the part of Congress will be required, to the end that the boundary may be defined 'in such a manner that it can be established either upon the ground or laid down on a map with that degree of definiteness which should always characterize a boundary line between two states.'\n On January 12, 1841, the Governor of Michigan addressed a special message to the state Legislature, in which he stated that a strict adherence to the terms of the Michigan Enabling Act defining the boundary in question, according to information recently communicated to him by the state geologist, would seem to be 'absolutely impracticable.' With the message was transmitted the communication referred to, together with a sketch of the country which the governor thought would present with sufficient certainty the disagreements between the description contained in the enabling act and the actual geography of the region. Thereupon, the Legislature-evidently with Capt. Cram's report before it, since the bill avers that action was taken, 'relying on the representations made in said report as to the impossibility of locating said boundary in accordance with the (Michigan \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n Enabling Act)'-adopted a joint resolution, reciting that from a critical examination of the country it appeared that a strict and literal conformity with the description was impossible, and that presumptively the general intent could be attained without much difficulty if the line be immediately marked and described, and requesting Congress to cause the boundary in question to be surveyed, and marked, and a commissioner appointed to act with a state commissioner, to the end that the boundary be established in conformity with the manifest general intent of the act. The state delegation in Congress was requested by the resolution to endeavor to secure congressional action to effect this object.\n In 1842, and again in 1843, a bill was introduced in the United States Senate by a Michigan senator to amend the Michigan Enabling Act, so as to make the disputed boundary conform substantially to the line as it was subsequently defined in the Wisconsin Enabling Act, including that portion relating to the division of the islands in the Brule and Menominee rivers. These bills failed, apparently for parliamentary reasons, and not because there was any substantive objection to them. Then followed the Wisconsin Enabling Act of 1846, the pertinent words of which we have quoted. The provision of this act describing the boundary now in question, and providing for a division of the islands in the Brule and Menominee, was submitted in the House by a Michigan congressman, with the statement that it had been agreed upon between the members from Michigan and the Wisconsin delegate. Shortly thereafter, Congress directed a survey of 'so much of the line between Michigan and Wisconsin as lies between the source of Brule river and the source of Montreal river, as defined by the ( Wisconsin Enabling Act),' 9 Stat. 85, 97, c. 175, s 4, and in pursuance thereof a survey was made by William A. Burt in 1847. Burt's line, which was marked with posts set at \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n half-mile intervals and otherwise identified, substantially followed Cram's recommendation and is the line now claimed by Wisconsin.\n It does not appear that Michigan acted affirmatively in respect of the proviso that the adjustment of boundaries as fixed in the Wisconsin Enabling Act should not be binding on Congress, unless the same should be ratified by Michigan on or before June 1, 1848. Nevertheless Wisconsin was admitted by the Act of May 29, 1848, supra, with the express provision that its boundaries should be as prescribed by the Enabling Act of 1846\n\n\n But, while Michigan did not in terms ratify the proviso just mentioned, there was inserted in her Constitution of 1850, and ratified by the people, the following description of the boundary in question:\n'... To the mouth of the Montreal river; thence through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal to the head waters thereof; thence in a direct line to the center of the channel between Middle and South Islands in the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line to the southern shore of Lake Brule ; thence along said southern shore and down the river Brule to the main channel of the Menominee river; thence down the center of the main channel of the same to the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan; thence through the center of the most usual ship channel of the said Bay to the middle of Lake Michigan. ...' Article 1 (Comp. L. Mich. 1915, pp. 133, 134).\n\n This description was adopted by the constitutional convention held in 1867, with the addition of the words found in the Wisconsin Enabling Act: 'As marked upon the survey made by Captain Cram.' The same description, including the reference to the Cram survey, was again readopted by the Michigan special constitutional commission of 1873. The proceedings of both the convention and the commission show that these readoptions were \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n made deliberately and with full understanding. Both proposed Constitutions, however, were rejected by the people, but apparently for reasons having no relation to the question of boundaries. Thus the matter rested until 1908, in which year a new and amended Constitution was adopted, containing a radically different description of the boundary in question, namely:\n'... Thence in a direct line through Lake Superior to the mouth of the Montreal river; thence through the middle of the main channel of the westerly branch of the Montreal river to Island Lake, the head waters thereof; thence in a direct line to the center of the channel between Middle and South Islands in the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line to the southern shore of Lake Brule ; ...' Article 1, s 1 (Comp. L. Mich. 1915, pp. 209, 210).\n\n By this description for the first time the westerly branch of the Montreal was brought in and the line carried through the main channel thereof to Island Lake. During the same year, the Attorney General of the state was directed by the state Legislature to investigate and institute proceedings to secure a determination of the correct boundary. The investigation was made and reported, and again the matter rested until 1919, at which time the state Legislature provided for the appointment of a commission to investigate the 'disputed' boundary line. This commission made a report in 1921, and was continued by an act of the Legislature passed the same year. The bill was filed in this court on October 8, 1923.\n When admitted to statehood, Wisconsin was, and ever since has continued to be, in possession of the area in dispute; that is to say, of all lands within the boundary which she now claims. As early as 1850, county government was established upon the basis of this boundary. In 1874, taxes were assessed and collected by Wisconsin, and by 1886 practically the entire area had been subjected to such taxation. During this time, towns were \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 307]\n\u00a0\n built, highways constructed, public buildings erected, elections held, Wisconsin law enforced, and other customary acts of dominion and jurisdiction exercised by that state within the disputed area.\n From the foregoing facts and circumstances the conclusions are inevitable: That the description in the Michigan Enabling Act of the line from the mouth of the Montreal to the Lake of the Desert was inserted under the mistaken belief that the river connected with the lake; that this mistake was discovered as early as 1841, of which discovery Michigan, long prior to the admission of Wisconsin, had knowledge; that the line as now claimed by Wisconsin was surveyed and marked by Cram and Burt at the dates already stated; that Michigan not only assented to the result of these surveys, but actively participated in securing the insertion of the description of that line in the Wisconsin Enabling Act, and herself substantially adopted it by the Constitution of 1850; and that for a period of more than 60 years she stood by without objection, with full knowledge of the possession, acts of dominion, and claim and exercise of jurisdiction on the part of the state of Wisconsin over the area in question.\n In addition to this, the line as claimed by Wisconsin has been, from the time of the Burt survey, accepted as the true boundary by the United States, and, in its surveys, plats, and maps, sales and other acts in respect of the public lands, continuously and consistently recognized, with the knowledge of Michigan and without protest on her part. Indeed, nothing appears to indicate dissatisfaction with the boundary thus established until the adoption of the Constitution of 1908, and, even then, except to the extent that this may be regarded as a continuing assertion of a claim to the boundary as there set forth or as originally described in the Michigan Enabling Act, the matter was allowed to rest until 1919.\n To meet this situation, it is contended that the state of Michigan through all these years labored under a mistake \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 308]\n\u00a0\n in respect of the real facts and that this was the result of excusable ignorance on her part. The contention is devoid of merit. The material facts, since at least the date of the Wisconsin Enabling Act, have been so obvious that knowledge of them on the part of the Michigan authorities, if it were not shown, as it is shown, by the evidence, must necessarily be assumed.\n Notwithstanding the state of Michigan at this late day insists that the boundary now be established by a decree of this court in accordance with the description contained in her Constitution of 1908. Plainly this connot be done. That rights of the character here claimed may be acquired on the one hand, and lost on the other, by open, longcontinued, and uninterrupted possession of territory, is a doctrine not confined to individuals, but applicable to sovereign nations as well, Direct United States Cable Co. v. Anglo-American Telegraph Co. (1877) L. R. 2 A. C. 394, 421; Wheaton, International Law (5th Eng. Ed.) 268, 269; 1 Moore, International Law Digest, 294 et seq.; and, a fortiori, to the quasi sovereign states of the Union. The rule, long settled and never doubted by this court, is that long acquiescence by one state in the possession of territory by another and in the exercise of sovereignty and dominion over it is conclusive of the latter's title and rightful authority. Indiana v. Kentucky, 10 S. Ct. 1051, \n136 U.S. 479\n, 509 et seq.; Virginia v. Tennessee, 13 S. Ct. 728, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 522\n, 524 S.; Louisiana v. Mississippi, 26 S. Ct. 408, \n202 U.S. 1\n, 53; Maryland v. West Virginia, 30 S. Ct. 268, \n217 \nU.S. 1, 40\n, 44 S.; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639; Missouri v. Iowa, 7 How. 660, 677; New Mexico v. Colorado, 45 S. Ct. 202, \n267 \nU.S. 30, 40\n, 41 S.. That rule is applicable here, and is decisive of the question in respect of the Montreal river section of the boundary in favor of Wisconsin.\n The Menominee River Section.\n The description in the Michigan Enabling Act of this section of the boundary begins at the headwaters of the \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 309]\n\u00a0\n Menominee river nearest to the Lake of the Desert in a direct line-\n'thence, through the middle of that fork of the said river first touched by the said line, to the main channel of the said Menominee river; thence, down the center of the main channel of the same, to the centre of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay.' Section 2.\n\n The description in the act creating the territory of Wisconsin is the same, but in the opposite direction:\n'... Thence through the middle of the main channel of said ( Menominee) river, to that head of said river nearest to the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line, to the middle of said lake. ...' Section 1.\n\n But the description in the Wisconsin Enabling Act contains important differences:\n'... Thence up the channel of said (Menominee) river to the Brule river; thence up said last mentioned river to Lake Brule ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brule in a direct line to the centre of the channel between Middle and South Islands, in the Lake of the Desert. ...' Section 1.\n\n Or, stated in the order of the Michigan Constitution (article 1):\n'From the center of the channel between Middle and South Islands in the Lake of the Desert in a direct line to the southern shore of Lake Brule ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brule to the Brule river; thence down the Brule river to the Menominee; thence down the channel of the Menominee to its mouth.\n\n The evidence shows that Lake Brule is not the head of the Menominee nearest to the Lake of the Desert, as called for by the Michigan Enabling Act, though the Brule river is the principal tributary of the Menominee, and the inference is pretty clear that the change of description was made in the Wisconsin Enabling Act as a part of a general readjustment of the boundary. At any rate, since this part of the line is not in controversy, we need not consider the matter, except as it may reflect light \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 310]\n\u00a0\n upon the effect of, and the question of Michigan's acquiescence in, the further provision that, to prevent disputes as to jurisdiction, the line shall be so run as to include within the jurisdiction of Michigan all islands in the Brule and Menominee, down to and including the Quinnesec Falls of the Menominee, and thence so as to include within the jurisdiction of Wisconsin all islands in the Menominee below the falls. As to this part of the line, the contention of Wisconsin is that the description in the Wisconsin Enabling Act was in effect a proposed adjustment of the boundary as an undividable unit, and that Michigan, by the Constitution of 1850, having expressly adopted that part of the line from the Lake of the Desert to Lake Brule , cannot be heard to say that she did not also adopt the adjustment of the line in respect of a division of the islands. There is force in this contention, and especially so in view of the fact that the change from the nearest headwater of the Menominee to Lake Brule operated to give Michigan additional territory. To permit her to reap the benefit of the adjustment so far as it is to her advantage, and reject it to the extent that it is advantageous to her sister state, would be plainly inequitable. We prefer, however, to rest our determination upon the conclusion, fully justified by the record, that- whatever were the rights of the respective states in respect of the islands in question immediately upon the adoption of the Constitution of 1850-Wisconsin, for a period of more than half a century following that time, had the undisputed and undisturbed possession of substantially all of the islands in the river below the Quinnesec Falls, and, without reference to the main channel of the river, exercised jurisdiction and dominion over them with the knowledge and acquiescence of the complainant.\n Capt. Cram's first report to Congress, dated December, 1840, points out the impracticability of following the center of the main channel of the river:\n\n\n[270 U.S. 295, 311]\n\u00a0\n 'The 'center' of the main channel of the Menominee river is made a part of the boundary. The river contains numerous islands, and consequently more than one channel, where these islands occur. It will be impossible in many of these cases to known which is the 'main channel' of these cases to know which is the 'main channel was tried and found impossible to decide by a simple inspection or reconnaissance which was the 'main channel.' It should also be remarked here that the term 'main channel,' applied to the multiplicity of channels of the Menominee, would be somewhat ambiguous in any event-for, it may be asked: Is the main channel the widest channel of the river? Or is it the deepest? If it is the widest or deepest now, will it be the widest or deepest hereafter? Or shall the main channel be that through which the greater quantity of water shall be found to pass at the time of the survey? And if it should occur that two channels at the same island pass equal quantities of water-which would then be regarded as the boundary? These questions are sufficient to show the indefiniteness of the term 'main channel.' There are also a few islands in the Brule river to which similar questions might apply in reference to the term 'main channel.'\n'To avoid all ambiguity in reference to these channels, it might be specified in the act defining the boundary that, in ascending the stream, the boundary shall follow the extreme left-hand of the Brule and the extreme right-hand channel of the Menominee down to a well- known point of the river, say Pe-me-ne Falls, and thence to follow the extreme left-hand channel of the remainder of the Menominee to its mouth. Such a division would leave most of the islands in Michigan and the remainder in Wisconsin, and would avoid much expense in minute surveys to ascertain the 'main channel,' and would leave no indefiniteness upon this part of the boundary. The free use of either channel for the purposes of naviga- \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 312]\n\u00a0\n tion would, from an established principle of law, be open at all times to the citizens of either state, and the islands would be nearly distributed in equal proportions between the two states.'\n\n Following the date of this report in respect of the impossibility-or extreme difficulty practically amounting to that-of locating the boundary in accordance with the provisions of the Michigan Enabling Act, and, it fairly may be assumed, with a view of effectuating Capt. Cram's recommendation, the Michigan Legislature passed the resolution already referred to, calling upon Congress to cause the boundary to be surveyed and marked in conformity with the manifest general intent of the Michigan Enabling Act, and requesting the delegation of the state in Congress to use their efforts to secure such action. This was followed, as already stated, by the introduction of the bills in the Senate and the subsequent insertion, by agreement between the members of Congress from Michigan and the Wisconsin delegate, of the provision in the Wisconsin Enabling Act, dividing the islands in accordance with Capt. Cram's suggestion, except in a particular not important here.\n In 1854, the survey of all of the islands below Quinnesec Falls as a part of Wisconsin was directed by the United States Surveyor General for Wisconsin, and such survey was immediately begun and thereafter continuously prosecuted. The evidence, in our opinion, fairly shows that, as early as 1879, the greater part in area of all of them had been thus surveyed and platted as belonging to Wisconsin, including many which would fall on what Michigan claims is the Michigan side of the main channel. On behalf of Michigan, it is strongly contended that to this there are important exceptions. But, without going into details, it is enough to say that the clear weight of the evidence is to the contrary. It is true that so-called Island No. 8, or Merryman's Island, was surveyed as in \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 313]\n\u00a0\n both states, that the Wisconsin survey was subsequently canceled, and that thereafter exclusive jurisdiction over the tract of land constituting it was exercised by Michigan. It is said that, nevertheless, the 'island' is now claimed by Wisconsin; but, on the contrary, Wisconsin concedes that it belongs to Michigan. The fact is that the tract was originally considered to be an island, and consequently surveyed as a part of Wisconsin. Upon further investigation, it was found by the United States surveyor not to be an island, but, in realty, a part of the Michigan mainland. The Wisconsin survey was, accordingly, canceled and the title of Michigan thereafter fully conceded. Two other so-called islands of small area in the same vicinity are in like situation.\n Some of these islands, comparatively small in area and of little consequence, have never been surveyed or any definite acts of dominion exercised over them by either state. But to this we attach no importance. The assertion and exercise of dominion by Wisconsin over the islands on the Michigan side of the channel was begun and has continued in virtue of, and in reliance upon, the readjustment of the boundary set forth in the Wisconsin Enabling Act. The rule is well settled in respect of individual claimants that actual possession of a part of a tract by one who claims the larger tract, under color of title describing it, extends his possession to the entire tract in the absence of actual adverse possession of some part of it by another. Clarke's Lessee v. Courtney, 5 Pet. 319, 354; Hunnicutt v. Peyton, \n102 U.S. 333\n, 368, L. Ed. 113; Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Pet. 412, 442; Smith v. Gale, 12 S. Ct. 674, \n144 \nU.S. 509, 525\n, 526 S.; Montoya v. Gonzales, 34 S. Ct. 413, \n232 U.S. 375\n, 377; Houston Oil Co. of Texas v. Goodrich, 213 F. 136, 142, 129 C. C. A. 488. Upon like grounds and with equal reason, under circumstances such as are here disclosed, the principal of the rule applies where states are the rival claimants. It results that the Wisconsin Enabling Act, together with the Act \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 314]\n\u00a0\n of Admission, gave color of title in that state to all of the islands within the limits there described, and that her original and continued possession, assertion, and exercise of dominion and jurisdiction over a part of these islands, pursuant to such legislation and with the acquiescence of Michigan, extended Wisconsin's possession, dominion, and jurisdiction to all of them, in the absence of actual possession of, or exercise of dominion over, any territory within the boundary by Michigan. The fact that the islands constitute separated tracts of land is of no consequence here, whatever its effect might be under other conditions. In applying the rule, the area within the described boundary, both land and water, must be considered as together constituting a single tract of territory.\n We therefor hold, as to this section of the boundary, that from Lake Brule to the mouth of the Menominee the line, which is now fixed and finally established by long acquiescence, follows the channels of the Brule and Menominee, wherever they are free from islands; that wherever islands are encountered above the Quinnesec Falls the line follows the channel nearest the Wisconsin mainland, so as to throw all such islands into Michigan; and that whereever islands are encountered below the Quinnesec Falls the line follows the channel nearest the Michigan mainland, so as to throw all such islands into Wisconsin.\n The Green Bay Section.\n In determining the boundary through this section, the question is not embarrassed by differences of description. The calls of the Michigan Enabling Act are down the channel of the Menominee to 'the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan; thence through the center of the most usual ship channel of the said bay to the middle of Lake Michigan.' The Wisconsin Enabling Act calls for the same boundary. \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 315]\n\u00a0\n The evidence shows that there are two distinct ship channels, to either of which this description might apply. From the mouth of the Menominee, the channel, according to the Michigan claim, proceeds across the waters of Green Bay in an easterly direction until near the westerly shore of the Door county peninsula; thence, in close proximity to the shore, in a northerly direction to a point opposite Death's Door channel ( or Porte des Morts); thence through that channel into Lake Michigan. The channel claimed by Wisconsin, after leaving the mouth of the Menominee, turns to the north and pursues a northerly direction to a point opposite the Rock Island passage, which lies between Rock Island and St. Martin's Island; thence through the Rock Island passage into Lake Michigan. The territory in dispute lies between these rival channels, and embraces two groups of islands: (1) Chambers Island, the Strawberry Islands, and a few others, small and unnamed, all within the main waters of Green Bay west of the Door county peninsula; and (2) Rock, Washington, Detroit, and Plum Islands, lying between Death's Door channel and the Rock Island passage, at the north end of the peninsula. The evidence as to which of the two ship channels was the usual one at the time of the adoption of the Michigan Enabling Act is not only conflicting, but of such inconclusive character that, standing alone, we could base no decree upon it with any feeling of certainty. Living witnesses are no longer available; and tradition, recollection of statements made by persons long since dead, if of any legitimate value, deductions drawn from ancient documents, more or less cryptic, and inferences based on more recent uses of the channels, or on their relative safety and convenience as indicated by physical characteristics, all relied upon in the absence of first-hand evidence, constitute at best most unsatisfactory substitutes. If it were necessary, we should, of course, undertake the task-as we should be \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 316]\n\u00a0\n bound to do-of reaching a conclusion from these dubious premises. But it is not necessary, for, as in the case of the two sections of the boundary just discussed, the title of Wisconsin to the disputed area now in question is established by long possession and acquiescence, and this conclusion is justified by evidence and concessions of the most substantial character.\n There is evidence of acts of dominion and possession of some of the disputed islands while Wisconsin was yet a territory. Almost from the day of her admission, the state has continuously possessed, asserted title, and exercised jurisdiction and dominion over all of the islands within the boundary claimed by her. In support of this general statement, the following, among other things, may be cited: On March 21, 1855, Washington, Detroit, Rock, and Plum Islands, described as being in the waters of Green Bay in Door county, were organized by an act of the Wisconsin Legislature as the town of Washington. Chapter 210, Priv. & Loc. Laws Wis. 1855. A census taken the same year by the town clerk showed a population of 318, which has since grown, it is said, to about 1,000. Since before that time the United States Land Department, by its surveys, plats, and sales of public lands, has uniformly and notoriously recognized the islands as a part of Wisconsin, without objection on the part of Michigan. Indeed, as early as 1837, they were surveyed and platted as a part of Wisconsin territory. A large number of maps, published and available to the public during the years between 1837 and 1878, without exception, show the islands as a part of Wisconsin, and during the same time they do not appear in any survey or upon any map as belonging to Michigan. Never, so far as we are able to find from the record, have they been recognized in any pratical way as a part of Michigan, or prior to the commencement of this suit, claimed by that state.\n The evidence in respect of the other group of islands, while perhaps not so complete, is definite and clear to the \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 317]\n\u00a0\n same effect. The taxation of lands on Chambers Island began while Wisconsin was still a territory. In 1861 voters on that island participated in a Wisconsin election. A history of Door county, introduced by complainant, recites that the island constituted an organized town forming a part of Door county, Wis., as early as 1867. Evidence of early and continued recognition and treatment of the island as a part of Wisconsin by the United States through its surveys, etc., is to the same effect as that in respect of the other group. And the evidence is likewise the same in respect of the uniform appearance of Chambers Island and the other small islands of the group upon the old maps as a part of Wisconsin, and their absence from Michigan surveys and maps. The absence of evidence of specific acts of dominion over the strawberries and the other small islands of this group is easily understood and does not affect the result. They are of little consequence, lying well within the boundary as claimed by Wisconsin, easterly from Chambers Island and near the westerly shore of the Door county peninsula. They appear on all maps as, and have never been regarded or treated otherwise than, a part of Door county. It is impossible to give them a status differing from that of the larger island and the peninsula, between, and within the shadows of, which they lie.\n That Wiconsin since statehood has continuously asserted title and has exercised complete and exclusive dominion over all the islands of both groups is really not a serious issue. Indeed, the bill of complaint avers that Wisconsin has possessed herself of, and exercised sovereignty over, the islands, including Washington, Plum, the Strawberries, and numerous other valuable islands, and has excluded and continues to exclude the state of Michigan from her rights thereto, and, more particularly that 'Wisconsin has for many years disregarded the true and \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 318]\n\u00a0\n rightful boundary, ... and has for a long time past possessed and does now possess, and has asserted and does now assert, civil, criminal, and political jurisdiction over those portions of the territory within the Michigan boundaries above described as the Montreal river section, the Menominee river section, and Green Bay section of the disputed territory, aggregating approximately 255,000 acres, ... and has unlawfully taxed and still continues to unlawfully tax said property. ...' The explanation relied upon is that the state of Michigan, as a result of her excusable ignorance, has not been aware of the real facts, and therefore should not be held to have lost rights by long acquiescence which she otherwise might have had. This view cannot be accepted, and may be dismissed, with a reference to what we have already said as to the same defense in respect of the Montreal river section.\n In respect of the controversy as a whole, and each of the three sections, the words of this court is Indiana v. Kentucky, supra, 136 U. S. p. 509, 10 S. Ct. 1054, are singularly apposite and conclusive:\n'... It was over 70 years after Indiana became a state before this suit was commenced, and during all this period she never asserted any claim by legal proceedings to the tract in question. She states in her bill that all the time since her admission Kentucky has claimed the Green River Island to be within her limits, and has asserted and exercised jurisdiction over it, and thus excluded Indiana therefrom, in defiance of her authority and contrary to her rights. Why, then, did she delay to assert by proper proceedings her claim to the premises? On the day she became a state her right to Green River Island, if she ever had any, was as perfect and complete as it ever could be. On that day, according to the allegations of her bill of complaint, Kentucky was claiming and exercising, and has done so ever since, the \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 319]\n\u00a0\n rights of sovereignty both as to soil and jurisdiction over the land. On that day, and for many years afterwards, as justly and forcibly observed by counsel, there were perhaps scores of living witnesses whose testimony would have settled, to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt, the pivotal fact upon which the rights of the two states now hinge and yet she waited for over 70 years before asserting any claim whatever to the island, and during all those years she never exercised or attempted to exercise a single right of sovereignty or ownership over its soil. It is not shown, as he adds, that an officer of hers executed any process, civil or criminal, within it, or that a citizen residing upon it was a voter at her polls, or a juror in her courts, or that a deed to any of its lands is to be found on her records, or that any taxes were collected from desidents upon it for her revenues.\n\n'This long acquiescence in the exercise by Kentucky of dominion and jurisdiction over the island is more potential than the recollections of all the witnesses produced on either side. Such acquiescence in the assertion of authority by the state of Kentucky, such omission to take any steps to assert her present claim by the state of Indiana, can only be regarded as a recognition of the right of Kentucky too plain to be overcome, except by the clearest and most unquestioned proof. It is a principle of public law, universally recognized, that long acquiescence in the possession of territory, and in the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the nation's title and rightful authority.'\n\n The result is that complainant has failed to maintain her case in any particular, and that the claims of Wisconsin as to the location of the boundary in each of the three sections are sustained.\n The decree, therefore, will be for Wisconsin, costs to be divided between the parties in accordance with the general rule in cases of this character. North Dakota v. Min- \n\n[270 U.S. 295, 320]\n\u00a0\n nesota, 44 S. Ct. 208, 263 U. L. 583. The boundary seems to be sufficiently defined for all purposes of future possession and jurisdiction; but the parties, or either of them, if so advised, may within 30 days submit the form of a decree more particularly to carry this opinion into effect, failing which a simple decree dismissing the bill will be entered.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MICHIGAN v.

Henry Caruthers, both of Jefferson City, Mo., and Jesse W. Barrett, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was a physician licensed to practice by the state board of health of Missouri. On complaint made to the board, and after notice and hearing, his license to practice was revoked on the ground that he had unlawfully produced an abortion. The proceedings before the board were reviewed on certiorari by the state circuit court and the determination of the board sustained. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri, \n\n[271 U.S. 40, 41]\n\u00a0\n the judgment was affirmed. 264 S. W. 678, 304 Mo. 607. The case comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1214).\n By section 7336 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, the state board of health is authorized to grant licenses for the practice of medicine within the state, and, after hearing, to revoke licenses 'for producing criminal abortions,' and for other specified causes. Hearings are required to be upon 20 days' written notice, personally served upon the physician against whom charges are made, containing 'an exact statement of the charges and the date and place set for hearing.' The statute provides:\n'Testimony may be taken by deposition, to be used in evidence on the trial of such charges before the board in the same manner and under the same rules and practice as is now provided for the taking of depositions in civil cases.'\n\n It is also provided that proceedings before the board may be reviewed by the state circuit court on certiorari and, as was done here, an appeal may be taken from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court of the state.\n Plaintiff's assignments of error assail the correctness of various rulings of the state court as to the meaning and effect of the statute drawn in question. These assignments must be disregarded here, as upon writ of error to a state court we are bound by its construction of the state law. See West v. Louisiana, 24 S. Ct. 650, \n194 U.S. 258\n; Gatewood v. North Carolina, 27 S. Ct. 167, \n203 U.S. 531\n, 541; Watson v. Maryland, 30 S. Ct. 644, \n218 U.S. 173\n; Schneider Granite Co. v. Gast Realty Co., 38 S. Ct. 125, \n245 U.S. 288\n, 290. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that, in the proceedings for the revocation of the plaintiff's license, he was entitled to take testimony on deposition, as provided by the statute, but not to subpoena witnesses to appear before the board, and that his application for such subpoenas was properly denied. It is assigned as error that these rulings and the revocation \n\n[271 U.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n of plaintiff's license by the state board of health were a denial of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n It has been so often pointed out in the opinions of this court that the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned with the substance and not with the forms of procedure as to make unnecessary any extended discussion of the question here presented. The due process clause does not guarantee to a citizen of a state any particular form or method of state procedure. Its requirements are satisfied if he has reasonable notice, and reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present his claim or defense; due regard being had to the nature of the proceedings and the character of the rights which may be affected by it. Hurtado v. California, 4 S. Ct. 111, \n110 U.S. 516\n; Maxwell v. Dow, 20 S. Ct. 448 \n176 U.S. 581\n; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Schmidt, 20 S. Ct. 620, \n177 U.S. 230\n; West v.

Ct. 535, \n224 U.S. 510\n.\n The procedure authorized by the Missouri statute, as it was applied by the board, satisfied these requirements. The notice prescribed was reasonable. The testimony of all witnesses who appeared before the board was taken and recorded, including that of the plaintiff in error. Although the statute did not authorize the board to issue subpoenas, the plaintiff in error was authorized, as the state court held, to take the depositions of witnesses who did not voluntarily appear. See State ex rel. Farber v. Shot, 263 S. W. 804, 304 Mo. 523. Officers who take depositions are authorized to compel witnesses to attend and give testimony. Rev. Stat. Mo. 1919,  5460. The depositions, when taken, may be read at the hearing before the board. State ex rel. Farber v. Shot, supra. The procedure prescribed and followed here gave ample opportunity to plaintiff to make a defense to the charges preferred, and there was no denial of due process.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n Nor did the statute deny to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws. A statute which places all physicians in a single class, and prescribes a uniform standard of professional attainment and conduct, as a condition of the practice of their profession, and a reasonable procedure applicable to them as a class to insure conformity to that standard, does not deny the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

C., for defendants.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought in this court by the state of New Jersey against the Attorney General of the United States and the members of the Federal Power Commission, all alleged to be citizens of other states, to obtain a judicial declaration that certain parts of the Act of June 10, 1920, called the Federal Water Power Act (41 Stat. 1063, c. 285 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  9992 1\/4-9992 1\/4 qq)), are unconstitutional, in so far as they relate to waters within or bordering on that state, and to enjoin the defendants from taking any steps towards applying or enforcing them in respect of those waters. The defendants respond with a motion to dismiss, on the ground, among others, that the bill does not present a case or controversy appropriate for the exertion of judicial power, but only an abstract question respecting the relative authority of Congress and the state in dealing with such waters. If this be a proper characterization of the bill the motion to dismiss must prevail, as a reference to prior decisions will show.\n In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, this court had before it a bill by the state of Georgia challenging the power of Congress to enact the so-called Reconstruction Acts, and \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n seeking an injunction against the Secretary of War and others to prevent them from giving effect to that legislation. On examining the bill the court found that it was directed against an alleged encroachment by Congress on political rights of the state, and not against any actual or threatened infringement of rights of persons or property, and on that ground the bill was dismissed. The nature and extent of the judicial power under the Constitution were much considered; the statement of Mr. Justice Thompson in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 75-'It is only where the rights of persons or property are involved, and when such rights can be presented under some judicial form of proceedings, that courts of justice can interpose relief. This court can have no right to pronounce an abstract opinion upon the constitutionality of a state law. Such law must be brought into actual or threatened operation upon rights properly falling under judicial cognizance, or a remedy is not to be had here'-was quoted with approval; and the court added:\n'By the second section of the third article of the Constitution 'the judicial power extends to all cases, in law and equity, arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States,' etc., and as applicable to the case in hand, 'to controversies between a state and citizens of another state'-which controversies, under the Judiciary Act, may be brought, in the first instance, before this court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, and we agree, that the bill filed, presents a case, which, if it be the subject of judicial cognizance, would, in form, come under a familiar head of equity jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction to grant an injunction to restrain a party from a wrong or injury to the rights of another, where the danger, actual or threatened, is irreparable, or the remedy at law inadequate. But, according to the course of proceeding under this head in equity, in order to entitle the party to the remedy, a case must be presented appropriate \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n for the exercise of judicial power; the rights in danger, as we have seen, must be rights of persons or property, not merely political rights, which do not belong to the jurisdiction of a court, either in law or in equity.'\n\n In Marye v. Parsons, \n114 \nU.S. 325\n, 5 S. Ct. 932, 962, a owner of coupons cut from bonds of the state of Virginia issued with a guaranty that the coupons should be receivable in payment of taxes, brought a bill in equity in a federal court in that state against the tax collectors to compel them to recognize the guaranty and to disregard later statutes forbidding acceptance of such coupons in payment of taxes. The coupons were overdue, the state had made default in their payment, and the tax collectors had announced a general purpose to follow the subsequent statutes. The coupons were transferrable and could be sold at nearly their face value to other persons who had taxes to pay, provided the plaintiff obtained a decree adjudging the subsequent statutes invalid and directing the collectors to accept the coupons when tendered in payment of taxes by any lawful holder. Indeed, an arrangement to sell the coupons on these terms had been effected before the bill was filed. But no one was then in a position to tender the coupons to the tax collectors, because the plaintiff who owned the coupons had no tax to pay, and because the prospective transferrees, while having taxes to pay, did not as yet own the coupons. The bill set forth the situation just described and prayed a decree along the lines suggested. In the court of first instance the plaintiff obtained a decree, but this court reversed it and directed a dismissal of the bill for want of jurisdiction, saying:\n'The bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character, that the contract set out requiring coupons to be received in payment of taxes and debts due to the state is valid; that the statutes of the General Assembly of Virginia impairing its obligations are con \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n trary to the Constitution of the United States, and therefore void; and that it is the legal duty of the collecting officers of the state to receive them when offered in payment of such taxes and debts.\n\n'But no court sits to determine questions of law in thesi. There must be a litigation upon actual transactions between real parties, growing out of a controversy affecting legal or equitable rights as to person or property. All questions of law arising in such cases are judicially determinable. The present is not a case of that description.'\n\n In Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S. Ct. 250, the question was whether, consistently with the limitations of the judicial power, this court could entertain, on an appeal from the Court of Claims, a suit brought under a permissive act of Congress by members of the Cherokee Tribe of Indians to determine the constitutional validity of congressional enactments enlarging prior restrictions on the alitenation of their allotments and permitting newlyborn children and other members of the tribe omitted from a prior enrollment to share in the distribution of tribal lands and funds. In an extended opinion the court pointed out that the suit did not present an actual controversy between the parties respecting any specific right of person or property, but only a question of the power of Congress to enact the legislation described, and held that such a suit was not within the scope of the judicial power and could not be entertained by this court, originally or on appeal, even under a permissive act of Congress.\n In Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158\n, 42 S. Ct. 261, where a bill praying that an act enlarging the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission and creating the Railroad Labor Board be declared unconstitutional, and action thereunder prevented by injunction, was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, this court said:\n\n\n[269 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n 'The bill is of unusual length, 65 printed pages. Much of it is devoted to the presentation of an abstract question of legislative power-whether the matters dealt with in several of the provisions of titles III and IV fall within the field wherein Congress may speak with constitutional authority, or within the field reserved to the several states. The claim of the state, elaborately set forth, is that they fall within the latter field, and therefore that the congressional enactment is void. Obviously, this part of the bill does not present a case or controversy within the range of the judicial power as defined by the Constitution. It is only where rights, in themselves appropriate subjects of judicial cognizance, are being, or are about to be, affected prejudicially by the application or enforcement of a statute that its validity may be called in question by a suitor and determined by an exertion of the judicial power.'\n And in Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S. Ct. 597, the court recognized and gave effect to the reasoning and principle of those cases by dismissing a bill brought by the commonwealth of Massachusetts to restrain executive officers from giving effect to an act of Congress alleged to be an unconstitutional usurpation of power, but not shown to affect prejudicially any proprietary or other right of the state subject to judicial cognizance.\n On reading the present bill we are brought to the conclusion, first, that its real purpose is to obtain a judicial declaration that, in making certain parts of the Federal Water Power Act applicable to waters within and bordering on the state of New Jersey, Congress exceeded its own authority and encroached on that of the state; and, secondly, that the bill does not show that any right of the state, which in itself is an appropriate subject of judicial cognizance, is being, or about to be, affected prejudicially by the application or enforcement of the act. We think the reasons for this conclusion will be \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 335]\n\u00a0\n indicated sufficiently by describing the act and then pointing out the distinctive features of the bill.\n The act is a long one, extends to all the states and organized territories and the District of Columbia, and varies its operation according to local situations and conditions. Some of its provisions are general, some relate to areas containing public and Indian lands, and some have special application to the use of government dams in developing power. As respects the state of New Jersey, the act may be adequately described for present purposes by stating that it relates particularly to navigable waters; subjects their improvement and utilization for purposes of navigation and developing power to stated restrictions and supervision by a public commission, which it creates; requires that such operations be carried on under preliminary permits and long-term licenses obtained from the commission and conditioned on compliance with the restrictions; provides that no license 'affecting the navigable capacity of any navigable waters' shall be issued until the plans of the dam or other structures affecting navigation have been approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War; directs that preference be given to applications by the state or any municipality; requires that each applicant for a license to use the waters for power purposes submit satisfactory evidence of his compliance with the laws of the state and of his right to engage in such business; prescribes that licensees shall pay to the United States reasonable annual charges, to be fixed by the commission, for the purpose of reimbursing the United States for the cost of administering the act, 'and for the expropriation to the government of excessive profits until' the state 'shall make provision for preventing excessive profits or the expropriation therefor (thereof) to' itself, but relieves the state and any municipality from the payment \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 336]\n\u00a0\n of any charge in respect of licenses for power purposes where the power is sold without profit or used for public purposes, and also in respect of licenses for projects primarily designed to improve navigation; and provides that any person or corporation, including the state or any municipality, intending to construct a dam or other works in a stream not declared navigable 'may in their discretion' file a declaration of their intention with the commission, whereupon it shall by investigation ascertain whether 'the interests of interstate or foreign commerce' will be affected thereby, that if it finds they will be affected the construction shall not proceed unless a license is sought and obtained, and that if it finds the other way the construction may proceed without a license. Some provisions relate particularly to the development of power, some only to improvement of navigation, and others to both, but all taken together suggest, if they do not show, that conservation for the purposes of navigation is a leading object. Thus it is said, in section 10(a), that every licensed project must be 'adapted to a comprehensive scheme of improvement and utilization for the purposes of navigation, of water-power development, and of other beneficial uses,' and, in section 10(c), that the licensee 'shall so maintain and operate said works as not to impair navigation.' One provision declares that nothing in the act shall be construed as affecting or interfering with the laws of the state relating to the 'control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein.' There are also provisions making it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not exceeding $1,000, for any licensee, or any person, willfully to fail or refuse to comply with any provision of the act, condition of a license, or regulation or order of the commission, and other provisions authorizing the Attorney General, on the recommendation of the commission or the Secretary of \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 337]\n\u00a0\n War, to bring suits to prevent, remedy or correct violations of the act or lawful regulations or orders thereunder, and also suits to revoke permits or licenses for violations of their terms.\n Rightly to appraise the bill one should have in mind the doctrine, heretofore firmly settled, that the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, which the Constitution vests in Congress, includes the power to control, for the purposes of such commerce, all navigable waters which are accessible to it and within the United States, whether within or without the limits of a state, and to that end to adopt all appropriate measures to free such waters from obstructions to navigation and to preserve and even enlarge their navigable capacity, and that the authority and rights of a state in respect of such waters within its limits, and in respect of the lands under them, are subordinate to this power of Congress.

Briggs, \n229 \nU.S. 82, 88\n, 33 S. Ct. 679, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 232; Greenleaf Lumber Co. v. Garrison, \n237 U.S. 251\n, 258, et seq., 35 S. Ct., 551; Willink v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 572, 580\n, 36 S. Ct. 422; United States v. Rio Grande Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 703\n, 19 S. Ct. 770\n\n\n The bill is directed against many provisions of the act, especially those requiring permits and licenses and subjecting licensees to various restrictions and conditions and those relating to projects for utilizing the waters in the development of power, and it directly alleges that they all go beyond the power of Congress and impinge on that of the state. Plainly these allegations do not suffice as a basis for invoking an exercise of judicial power.\n The bill further alleges, in an indefinite way, that 'it is the intention' of the state to utilize the Morris Canal, which it recently has acquired, for 'water power development' and in the 'conservation of potable waters'; that there are 'opportunities' for developing water \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 338]\n\u00a0\n power at several places along streams which feed the canal and in designated localities along the Delaware river 'where dams could be erected and power developed'; that the state 'contemplates' utilizing these opportunities 'through a state agency or by private enterprise' with a resulting profit to its treasury; that the state has an established policy respecting 'the conservation of potable waters,' which has been put into partial effect 'through its agencies and by private enterprise' by means of reservoirs and waterworks constructed at large cost; and that in its sovereign capacity the state owns lands under the bay of New York, the Hudson river, adjacent waters, and the Delaware river, from the leasing of which for dock, pier, and related purposes it derives a large revenue. These allegations are followed by others, similarly indefinite, to the effect that the challenged provisions of the act, if applied and enforced, will interfere with the state's contemplated development of 'the aforesaid power projects,' will jeopardize its policy respecting the conservation of potable waters, and work serious injury to reservoirs and waterworks constructed and used in that connection, will deprive the state of revenue from the leasing of its submerged lands and from the development and conservation of water resources, and will subject the state and its citizens to onerous restrictions and conditions not required for the protection or promotion of navigation or of interstate or foreign commerce.\n There is no showing that the state is now engaged or about to engage in any work or operations which the act purports to prohibit or restrict, or that the defendants are interfering or about to interfere with any work or operations in which the state is engaged. If the use of particular waters in connection with the Morris Canal or with any reservoirs and water works, before the act was passed, gave rise, as the bill suggests, to a right to continue such use, the act does not purport to disturb, but rather to rec- \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 339]\n\u00a0\n ognize, that right, and there is no showing that the defendants are taking or about to take any steps to prevent the state from exercising it. Passing that right, the state is merely shown to be contemplating power development and water conservation in the future. There is no showing that it has determined on or is about to proceed with any definite project. Neither is it shown that the defendants are now taking or about to take any definite action respecting waters bordering on or within the state, save as the commission is about to consider and act on 'various applications from persons in New Jersey' for preliminary permits and licenses to utilize 'navigable waters on the boundary and inland' for the development of water power. As the applications are not further described, it must be assumed that the permits are sought, as the act provides, 'for the sole purpose of maintaining priority of application for a license,' and that the licenses are sought conformably to the provision requiring applicants to submit satisfactory evidence of complicance with the laws of the state with respect to 'the appropriation, diversion and use of water for power purposes' and to 'the right to engage in' that business. While the state is thus apparently put in the position of objecting to the licensing of projects sanctioned by its own laws, the bill explains that the objection is chiefly to the restrictions and conditions to which, according to the terms of the act, an applicant is deemed to assent by seeking and accepting a license. These restrictions and conditions are assailed in the bill as passing beyond the field of congressional power and invading that reserved to the state. But whether they are thus invalid cannot be made the subject of judicial inquiry until they are given or are about to be given some practical application and effect. Naturally this will be after they become part of an accepted license, and after some right, privilege, immunity or duty asserted under them becomes the subject of actual con- \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 340]\n\u00a0\n troversy. Such a situation is not presented here. As respects the state's submerged lands, the bill signally fails to disclose any existing controversy within the range of the judicial power. Stating merely that the state will be deprived of revenue from the leasing of such lands is not enough. Facts must be stated showing that the act is being or about to be applied in a way which does or will encroach on or prejudicially affect the state's qualified right in the lands. There is no such showing.\n The state places some reliance on Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553\n, 43 S. Ct. 658. 67 L. Ed. 1117, 32 A. L. R. 300. But in this it overlooks important factors in that decision. Two bills substantially alike-one by Pennsylvania and the other by Ohio-were considered. Both were brought to prevent the enforcement of a West Virginia statute restricting the carrying of natural gas from that state into others. The gas had been for several years carried in large and continuous volume through pipe lines into Pennsylvania and Ohio, and those states had come to be largely dependent on it as a fuel for public institutions and otherwise. The statute, in its first section, imposed on the pipe line carriers an unconditional and mandatory duty (opinion, page 593 (43 S. Ct. 664)), which, if respected, would largely prevent this supply of fuel from moving into Pennsylvania and Ohio, and would subject those states to great loss. The bills disclosed that the situation when they were brought was such that the statute directly and immediately would effect a serious diminution of the volume of gas carried into the complaining states, and on which they were dependent (page 594 (43 S. Ct. 664)). Of the cases thus presented the court said:\n'Each suit presents a direct issue between two states as to whether one may withdraw a natural product, a common subject of commercial dealings, from an established current of commerce moving into the territory of the other. The complainant state asserts and the de- \n\n[269 U.S. 328, 341]\n\u00a0\n fendant state denies that such a withdrawal is an interference with interstate commerce forbidden by the Constitution. This is essentially a judicial question. It concededly is so in suits between private parties, and of course its character is not different in a suit between states.\n\n'What is sought is not an abstract ruling on that question, but an injunction against such a withdrawal presently threatened and likely to be productive of great injury. The purpose to withdraw is shown in the enactment of the defendant state before set forth and is about to be carried into effect by her officers acting in her name and at her command.'\n\n This bill falls far short of showing a situation like that presented there, and what it does show falls on the other side of the jurisdictional line.\n Our conclusion is that the bill cannot be entertained.\n Bill dismissed. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

This portion of the boundary line, it has been decided, extends along the south bank of the river. \n256 \nU.S. 70\n, 41 S. Ct. 420; \n256 \nU.S. 608\n, 41 S. Ct. 539; \n258 \nU.S. 574\n, 42 S. Ct. 406.\n The present controversy arises under a counterclaim filed by the state of Texas, in 1920. It relates to that portion of the boundary line extending northwardly along the 100th meridian from the Red River to the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, which constitutes the eastern boundary of the Panhandle of Texas and the main western boundary of Oklahoma. The only dispute is as to the location of this line upon the ground. Different surveys have been made. On the one side, Oklahoma and the United States claim that the line is that which was surveyed and marked in 1859 by A. H. Jones and H. M. C. Brown as the line of the 100th meridian, \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 24]\n\u00a0\n and retraced and extended in 1860 by John H. Clark; and, on the other side, Texas claims that it is a more easterly line, running north from a monument established by Arthur D. Kidder in 1902 to mark the intersection of the meridian and the Red River.\n Three separate contentions are made:\n\n\n (1)\n Oklahoma and the United States contend that by the decision and decree of this court in United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1\n, 16 S. Ct. 725, commonly called the Greer County Case, it was conclusively determined and decreed that the boundary line followed the line of the meridian as surveyed and marked on the ground by Jones, Brown and Clark, and the matter thereby became res judicata. (2) Oklahoma contends that, independently of this adjudication, the Jones, Brown and Clark line has been recognized as the true location of the meridian through a long course of years and is established as the boundary line by acquiescence and by long continued exercise of jurisdiction over the strip in dispute. (3) Texas on the other hand, contends that a line running north from the Killer monument is the established boundary.\n By the treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain1 the boundary line established between the two countries followed the course of the Red River westward to the 100th degree of west longitude, and crossing the Red River, ran thence due north to the Arkansas River; all 'as laid down in Melish's map of the United States.' The same line was established by the treaty of 1828 between the United States and the United Mexican States2 and confirmed by the Convention of 1838 between the United States and the Republic of Texas; 3 and it became part of the boundary between the State of Texas and the adjacent territory of the United States on the ad- \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 25]\n\u00a0\n mission of Texas into the Union in 1845.4 In 1850, however, by a legislative compact between the United States and the State of Texas, it was agreed that the northern boundary line of Texas should run west with the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes from its intersection with the 100th meridian;5 so that we are not now concerned with the portion of the meridian extending north of that parallel.\n Since 1850 many steps have been taken-at long intervals-looking to the establishment of the line of the meridian between the Red River and the parallel. To rightly understand the course of the legislation it should be borne in mind: First, that the Red River forks about sixty miles east of the strip of land now in dispute, the South Fork passing along its southern end, and the North Fork crossing it about forty miles to the north; and, secondly, that on Melish's map of the United States the 100th meridian was erroneously shown as crossing the Red River more than one hundred miles east of this strip, and east of the fork in the River. \n6\n These two facts gave rise to a controversy in reference to the location of the other boundary line along the course of the Red River, which, although now long determined, was interwoven with the question as to the location of the line of the meridian north of the river and complicated the issues involved in its settlement. In the light of this preliminary statement we proceed to set forth, in chronological order, the material facts7 necessary to the determination of the contentions now made. \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 26]\n\u00a0\n The first step towards the location of the boundary line was taken by the Texas Legislature, which in 1854 authorized the appointment of a commissioner, who, with a commissioner for the United States, should run and mark the entire boundary line between Texas and the territories of the United States from the point where it left the Red River to its intersection with the Rio Grande. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Pending action by Congress in this matter, the United States, by a treaty made with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians in 1855,9 awarded them a tract of land in the Indian territory whose western boundary was described as running north from the Red River along the 100th meridian to the main Canadian River. In 1857, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, for the purpose of marking the boundaries of the Indian lands, employed two contract surveyors, A. H. Jones and H. M. C. Brown, to survey and mark the line of the meridian from the north bank of the main Red River to the north boundary of the Creek or Seminole country.\n Before Jones and Brown had commenced this survey, Congress, in 1858, authorized the appointment of a joint commissioner to run and mark the boundary line between the territories of the United States and Texas in accordance with the Texas Act of 1854.10 The commissioners began their work on the Rio Grande, but differences soon arose, which caused them to separate; and the survey was continued solely by John H. Clark, the United States commissioner, who ran and marked a large part of the western boundary of Texas and its northern boundary along the parallel. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 21, 27]\n\u00a0\n Meanwhile Jones and Brown had made, in 1859, their survey of the boundary of the Indian lands. They began at a rock monument on the north bank of the South Fork of Red River, placed to mark the intersection of the 100th meridian with that stream, and ran the line of the meridian northwardly from this monument about 109 miles, marking it with mile posts. \n 12\n\u00a0\n\n In February, 1860, the Texas Legislature-then claiming, it appears, that the boundary line along the Red River followed the line of the North Fork-created the County of Greer, with a boundary including, in general terms, all the territory lying east of the 100th meridian and between the North and South Forks of the river; this being a tract containing more than 2,000 square miles and extending about sixty miles east of the Jones and Brown line. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Later in 1860, Clark, the United States commissioner, under instructions from the Secretary of the Interior, adopted and retraced so much of the line of the meridian as had been established by Jones and Brown, and prolonged their line to its intersection with the parallel, where he established an earth monument to mark the northeast corner of Texas. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n For many years after 1860 Texas asserted complete jurisdiction over the territory included in Greer County. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 21, 28]\n\u00a0\n At different times from 1872 to 1875, four United States contract surveyors separately retraced different portions of the Jones, Brown and Clark line of the 100th meridian and re-established most of it by rebuilding many of the mile posts. They also, at the same times, subdivided the public lands in the western part of the Indian territory in a series of townships closing on the west upon the line thus retraced and re-established, on which they erected the closing corners of the townships. \n 16\n\u00a0\n\n In 1876 the Texas Legislature established a series of five new counties lying west of the Jones, Brown and Clark line and extending southwardly from the parallel beyond the South Fork of Red River. Their eastern line commenced 'at a monument on the intersection of the one hundredth meridian' and the parallel, and called for five 'mile posts on the one hundredth meridian' and 'the initial monument on the one hundredth meridian.' One of these counties and parts of two others lay between the North and South Forks of Red River, and two of these 'mile posts' and the 'initial monument' were between the two Forks, that is, between these counties and Greer County. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n In 1879 Congress passed an Act creating the northern judicial district of the State of Texas, in which Greer County was included. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n In January,1882, the Secretary of the Interior, in response to a Resolution of the Senate calling for a report of any survey made by the United States and Texas Boundary Commission under the Act of 1858, trans- \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 29]\n\u00a0\n mitted a report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office in which, after setting forth the work that had been separately done by Clark in running the western and northern boundaries of Texas, the establishment of part of the line of the 100th meridian by Jones and Brown, and the retracing of their line by Clark, he specifically called attention to the fact that:\n'No part of said boundary survey has ever been officially agreed upon or accepted by the two governments as contemplated in the Act of Congress authorizing the survey.'\n\n This report was referred to the Senate Committee on Territories. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n At this same session of Congress-a controversy having meanwhile arisen as to the ownership of the territory included in Greer County-a Representative from Texas introduced a bill to define the boundary between the Indian Territory and Texas as running up the middle of the North Fork of the Red River to the 100th meridian, and thence due north to 'the northeast corner of said State of Texas as now established';20 while a Senator from Texas introduced a bill to create a joint commission to run and mark the boundary line along the course of the Red River westwardly to the 100th meridian, as laid down in Melish's map, and definitely settle which Fork was the principal or true Red River. \n21\n And before the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 30]\n\u00a0\n end of this session, the legislature of Texas, in May, 1882, passed an Act authorizing the appointment of a commissioner to run and mark, with a commissioner for the United States, the course of the Red River westwardly to the 100th degree of west longitude, as laid down on Melish's map, in order to settle the true location of the meridian and determine whether the North or South Fork was the true Red River designated in the treaty of 1819; and to establish a monument where the meridian crossed the river as a corner in the boundary. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n Congress took no final action in reference to any part of the boundary line at this session. In 1885, however, it passed an Act. reciting that a controversy existed between the United States and Texas as to the point where the 100th degree of longitude crossed the river, as described in the treaty, which had never been ascertained and fixed by any authority competent to bind the United States and Texas, and which should be settled so that the boundary then in dispute because of the difference of opinion as to this crossing might also be settled; and authorizing the President to designate officers who, in conjunction with such persons as might be appointed by Texas, should ascertain and mark the point where the 100th meridian crossed the Red River, in accordance with the terms of the treaty. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n In 1887 the President issued a proclamation reciting that the United States owned all of the territory lying between the 100th meridian and the North and South Forks of the Red River, but that the State of Texas had asserted a conflicting claim thereto growing out of a controversy as to the point where the meridian crossed the Red River, as described in the treaty of 1819, and that the United States commissioners appointed under the Act of 1885 day by their report determined that the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 31]\n\u00a0\n South Fork was the true Red River designated in the treaty, but the Texas commissioners had refused to concur in this report; and admonishing and warning the officers of Greer County and all other persons against exercising or attempting to exercise any authority over these lands. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n In 1890 Congress created the Territory of Oklahoma out of a portion of the Indian Territory bounded on the west and south by the boundary lines of the State of Texas;25 and by the same Act directed that a suit in equity be brought in this Court on behalf of the United States against the State of Texas, to settle the controversy as to the title to the land included in Greer County lying east of the 100th meridian, and between the Forks of the Red River. The suit was instituted in the same year.\n In 1891 the surveys made by Clark, the United States commissioner, under the Act of 1858, of the western and northern boundary lines of Texas, were 'confirmed' by an Act of Congress26 and by a Joint Resolution of the Texas Legislature;27 but neither the Act nor the Resolution made any reference to the survey of the eastern boundary.\n In 1892 H. S. Pritchett, Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Washington University, St. Louis, was employed by Texas to establish, scientifically and accurately, the intersection of the 100th meridian with the Red River. He located this intersection 3,797.3 feet east of the Jones and Brown initial monument. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n In 1896 this Court decided the Greer County Case, and entered a decree adjudging that the territory east of the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 32]\n\u00a0\n 100th meridian of longitude between the North Fork of the Red River and the south bank of the South Fork, called Greer County, constituted no part of the territory belonging to Texas, but was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. United States v. Texas, supra, at page 90 (16 S. Ct. 725).\n In 1901 Congress passed an Act, in which, after reciting that this Court had adjudged in the Greer County Case that 'the degree of longitude one hundred west' designated in the treaty of 1819, 'referred to the true one hundredth meridian astronomically located,' and that 'the true intersection of this meridian' with the South Fork of Red River had not been fixed by the United States and Texas, acting together, nor 'by the decree in said cause,' the Secretary of the Interior was directed to cause 'the intersection of the true one hundredth meridian' with the South Fork of the River, to be established and fixed 'by the most accurate and scientific methods,' and a suitable monument to be erected at such intersection. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n Pursuant to this Act the Secretary of the Interior detailed Arthur D. Kidder, Examiner of Surveys, to establish the point of intersection of the true meridian with the River. He did this work in 1902, making his observations and calculations according to the scientific methods then in use; determined that the true meridian intersected the South Fork at a point 3,699.7 feet east of the initial monument of Jones and Brown, and 97. 6 feet west of Pritchett's location; and placed a sandstone monument on the north side of the stream to mark the point of intersection as thus determined. His report and field notes were approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and adopted by the Secretary of the Interior, who transmitted copies of them to the House of Representatives, and reported, in accordance therewith, that he had caused 'the intersection of the true one \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 33]\n\u00a0\n hundredth meridian with the Red River' to be determined and established by a permanent monument in compliance with the Act of 1901.30\n In March, 1903, Kidder, who meanwhile had been further detailed by the Secretary of the Interior, as astronomer and surveyor, to establish and mark upon the ground the point of intersection of the 100th meridian with the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes, and three other astronomical points in the boundary of Texas, was directed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office to establish these standard reference points, and also to 'ascertain the condition of the old boundary lines, the amount of error in the original surveys and ... the changes which a true determination would involve,' and specifically, to 'make a careful retracement of the 100th meridian as closed upon in the survey of public lands in Oklahoma from the Red River north to the parallel.'\n Before Kidder had completed this supplemental work, the Texas Legislature in April, 1903, authorized the appointment of a commissioner to run and mark with a commissioner for the United States, the boundary lines between Texas and the Territories of Oklahoma and New Mexico.31 This Act recited that Kidder had duly fixed a monument at the intersection of the true 100th meridian with the Red River, as provided by the Act of Congress of 1901, which properly marked the boundary, and required a re- survey of the lines between Texas and Oklahoma; and directed that the monument established by Kidder as the point of intersection should 'be accepted as correct.'\n Kidder completed his supplemental work on the boundary line in 1903, and made a detailed report to the Secretary of the Interior in April, 1904, which was trans- \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 34]\n\u00a0\n mitted to the House of Representatives in December, 1905.32 The portion of this report dealing with the 100th meridian shows that he retraced the entire Jones, Brown and Clark line, as it had been re-established and closed upon by the various contract surveyors between 1872 and 1875, and found that, beginning at the initial monument of Jones and Brown on the bank of the South Fork of Red River, it deflected gradually to the east, and intersected the line of the parallel 743.16 feet west of the line of the 100th meridian extended north through the monument which he had previously placed on the South Fork. He found no evidence of the monument established by Clark in 1860 to mark this intersection. At the easterly point which Kidder determined to be the intersection of the parallel and the true meridian he placed a concrete and iron monument, but he did not mark the intervening line of the meridian. He also found that since the execution of the surveys closing upon the Jones, Brown and Clark line, the United States had patented and disposed of public lands on the east, and that Texas had apparently closed its surveys on the same line for a large part of the distance.\n In December, 1904, the Secretary of the Interior transmitted to the House of Representatives, the draft of a bill submitted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office to provide for the resurvey and re- establishment of portions of the boundary lines between Texas and the Territories of New Mexico and Oklahoma, including the line of the 100th meridian from the Red River to the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes. This was accompanied by a letter from the Commissioner, in which he stated that large errors had been discovered in the location of the 100th and 103d meridians, and that the agitation concerning questions of jurisdiction which had been prolific \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 35]\n\u00a0\n on account of these incorrect locations, could only be ended by the establishment of lines upon the ground in the locations where they were designed to be when these meridians were named as the boundaries of Texas. These were referred to the House Committee on Public Lands. \n33\n\u00a0\n\n In 1905 and 1906 a Representative from Texas introduced in the House of Representatives two bills and a joint resolution to provide for the running and marking of the boundary line between Texas and the Territories of the United States, in substantially the same terms as the Texas Act of 1903; except that, while accepting as correct Kidder's location of the intersection of the true 100th meridian with the Red River, they directed that the line be run north to the intersection of the meridian with the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes as determined by Clark, the United States commissioner, in 1859.34 These bills were recommended for passage by the House Committees on the Judiciary and on Indian Affairs, respectively, but no further action was had in reference to them. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n Again, in October, 1907, the Secretary of the Interior wrote a letter to the House of Representatives recommending the adoption of a Joint Resolution, a draft of which he enclosed, for the appointment of commissioners to establish the boundary between Texas and the Territories of the United States, substantially in accordance with the Texas Act of 1903, and likewise providing that the monument established by Kidder as the point of intersection of the true 100th meridian should 'be accepted as correct.' In this letter, after calling attention to the fact that no action had been taken by Congress in this matter, he said:\n'The adjustment of these lines is of \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 36]\n\u00a0\n great interest to the department, because they involve both public lands and lands of the Choctaw Indians, and until they are adjusted present problems and embarrassments which cannot be solved or removed until the lines are definitely fixed and marked. The continued unsettled condition of these boundary lines adds to the problems and involves the Government, settlers on the public lands, and citizens of the Indian tribes and of the State of Texas in trouble and expense ... of which they should be relieved at the earliest possible moment.'\n\n This letter and resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee. \n 36\n\u00a0\n\n In November, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted as a State of the Union. \n37\n\u00a0\n\n In 1910 the House Committee on Indian Affairs recommended for passage another Joint Resolution introduced by the Representative from Texas for the creation of a commission to establish and mark the boundary lines between Texas and the Territories of the United States, corresponding to the Joint Resolution which had been recommended by the Secretary of the Interior in 1907,38 but no further action was taken by Congress in reference to the matter.\n In 1910 also one John L. Wortham filed applications with the surveyors of the five counties that had been created in 1876, under the provisions of the Texas Acts authorizing the sale of vacant land, for the purchase from the State of the land on the east of these counties lying in the strip now in dispute, between the Jones, Brown and Clark line and Kidder's location of the 100th meridian, which had not been previously embraced in the land surveys of these counties. One of these surveyors \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 37]\n\u00a0\n having refused to make a survey for the purpose of obtaining a grant, it was held by the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, in 1912, that mandamus would not lie to compel him so to do, on the ground, substantially, that as the undisputed facts show that the State of Texas was not exercising jurisdiction over this land, it was not the duty of the county surveyor to survey lands which the political powers of this state recognized as lying beyond its limits, and the court had no jurisdiction to determine whether the de facto boundary line was the de jure boundary of the State, this being a political and not a judicial question. Wortham v. Sullivan, 147 S. W. 702. On the other hand, however, surveys having been made by other county surveyors and the applications returned to the General Land Office of Texas, three patents were issued to Wortham by the State of Texas later in the same year covering 2,002 acres of the strip of land in dispute; this being the only part of this strip which Texas has ever attempted to patent. Since that time, it is stipulated, the award to Wortham of other lands in this strip has been held in abeyance 'on account of the shadow of doubt cast upon the legal status of the aforesaid Kidder line,' but 'the General Land Office of Texas has in no sense abandoned its claim to the area west of and adjacent to' that line.\n In 1919 the Texas Legislature passed an Act reciting the existence of a controversy between Texas and Oklahoma, and possibly the United States and certain Indian tribes, concerning the boundaries between the two States, and directed that a suit be instituted in this Court for the purpose of determining and settling these boundaries. \n39\n But before this suit had been commenced the State of Oklahoma brought its suit in the present cause, in which, as has been stated, the State of Texas set up by counter- \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 38]\n\u00a0\n claim its contention in respect to the location of the 100th meridian.\n In 1923 the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey undertook to locate the portion of the 100th meridian in controversy by a modern and scientific method of triangulation, and concluded that the true meridian ran 371.5 feet east of the Kidder monument.\n In addition to the foregoing matters the parties have stipulated that:\n'The United States, the Territory of Oklahoma and the State of Oklahoma in succession have continuously enforced their laws, civil and criminal over the strip here in dispute ever since the decision in the Greer County Case.'\n\n It further appears that prior to May 3, 1920, the United States had disposed of 20,657 acres in the strip in dispute by patents issued on homestead entries and public sales, for which it had collected $8,026; that 3118 acres had been included in the school and university grants to Oklahoma; and that there were then 318 acres in pending entries, leaving, it was estimated, 118 acres of vacant land. The dates of these patents and grants are not shown.\n We come now to the consideration of the several contentions made by the parties.\n In the first place it is to be observed that while the intersection of the line of the 100th meridian and the South Fork of Red River has been located four times, that is, by Jones and Brown in 1859, by Pritchett in 1892, by Kidder in 1902, and by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1923-the three latter locations differing between themselves by less than 400 feet- there is no extrinsic evidence showing that any one of these locations is precisely correct. Nor is this claimed. And we have now no occasion to settle the exact location of the meridian line, as an original matter; the present contentions, as stated at the outset, being, on the one side, that the Jones, Brown and Clark line is conclusively established as the boundary by \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 39]\n\u00a0\n the decision and decree in the Greer County Case, and, also, independently of that adjudication, by long continued recognition, acquiescence, and the exercise of jurisdiction, and on the other side, that a line running north from the Kidder monument is the established boundary. We take up these contentions in their order.\n\n 1. \nThe Greer County suit was brought by the United States against Texas solely to settle the controversy as to the land in 'Greer County' lying east of the 100th meridian and between the Forks of the Red River. It did not involve any part of the boundary north of the River. Nor did it involve, under the issues submitted, the precise location of the meridian between the two Forks, but merely the general questions whether under the treaty of 1819 the boundary line along the course of the Red River followed the North or South Fork, or either of them, to the true meridian.\n On the hearing, as appears from the opinion, the United States contended that under the treaty of 1819 the boundary line following the course of the Red River westward to the 100th meridian, went along and up the South Fork, as the continuation or principal fork of the River (page 34 (16 S. Ct. 725)). Texas, on the other hand, contended: First, that as the treaty declared that the boundary line should be as laid down on Melish's map, which located the 100th meridian east of the forks, thereby throwing the entire area in dispute west of the meridian, it was immaterial whether this location of the meridian on the map, being conclusive upon both governments, was astronomically correct or not, or whether the one or the other fork was the continuation of the main river; and second, in the alternative, that even if the treaty referred to the true meridian, the course of the River followed the North Fork, and not the South (pages 34, 35 (16 S. Ct. 725)).\n The court first concluded that, upon a reasonable interpretation of its provisions, the treaty merely took \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 40]\n\u00a0\n Mellish's map as the general basis for the adjustment of the boundaries, and left open to subsequent determination and exact designation the precise location of the true 100th meridian (pages 38, 42 (16 S. Ct. 725)). Independently, however, of this interpretation of the treaty, it was added, as being, perhaps, a stronger view, and equally conclusive, that the official acts of the general government and of Texas required that the controversy should be determined upon the basis that the treaty line was intended to extend to the true or actual meridian, and not to stop at the Melish location (pages 38, 42 (16 S. Ct. 725)). In developing this view the court, after concluding and emphasizing that the legislative compact of 1850 between the United States and Texas accepted the true 100th meridian as the boundary line, and discarded the Melish location, said further that the precise location of the meridian had not been left in doubt by the two governments; that the United States had erected a monument at the point where it intersected the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes, and Texas had by its legislation often recognized the true meridian to be as located by the United States; that the two governments had, by official action, declared that the meridian was located on the line marking the eastern boundary of four of the counties established by Texas in 1876; that the proof left on room to doubt that the true meridian was 'immediately east of those counties'; and that the acts of the two governments and the evidence, therefore, concurred in showing that the meridian was 'not correctly delineated on the Melish map' (pages 39-41 (16 S. Ct. 725)). The final conclusion on this question was that, independently of the treatly itself, it must be held that the legislative compact of 1850, together with the subsequent acts of the two governments, required that the meridian 'be taken to be the true 100th meridian,' and, consequently, that the course of the Red River westward 'must go, and was intended to go, to the true or actual 100th meridian, and not stop at the Melish 100th \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 41]\n\u00a0\n meridian.' Page 42 (16 S. Ct. 735). Taking up then the remaining question whether, as the United States contended, the line following the course of the Red River westward met the 100th meridian at the point where the South Fork of the River crossed the meridian, or whether, as Texas contended, it ran up the North Fork northwestwardly until it crossed the meridian, the court, after a detailed consideration of the evidence, concluded that the South Fork more nearly met the requirements of the treaty, and was to be followed as the boundary line to its intersection with the true meridian ( pages 42, et seq. (16 S. Ct. 725)). There was, however, no statement in the opinion either that this point of intersection was fixed at the Jones and Brown initial monument, or that Jones, Brown and Clark had correctly located the line of the meridian.\n For the reasons stated in the opinion, the court entered a decree-set out at the end of the opinion itself-by which it was:\n'Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the territory east of the 100th meridian of longitude, west and south of the river now known as the North Fork of Red River, and north of a line following westward, as prescribed by the treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain, the course, and along the south bank, both of Red River and of the river now known as the Prairie Dog Town Fork or South Fork of Red River until such line meets the 100th meridian of longitude-which territory is sometimes called Greer County-constitutes no part of the territory properly included within or rightfully belonging to Texas at the time of the admission of that State into the Union, and is not within the limits nor under the jurisdiction of that State, but is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States of America.' Page 90 (16 S. Ct. 754).\n\n We are of opinion that the decision in that case is not conclusive upon the parties as an adjudication that the boundary line between Texas and the Territories of the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 42]\n\u00a0\n United States followed the line of the 100th meridian as surveyed and marked by Jones, Brown and Clark. The sole questions, under the issues submitted, were whether the erroneous location of the meridian on Melish's map was controlling, and, if not, whether the boundary line followed the North or South Fork to the intersection with the true meridian. No issue was submitted as to whether, if the South Fork were to be followed, the Jones, Brown and Clark line was to be taken as establishing the exact location of the true meridian and fixing the western boundary of the tract in dispute. And while it was said in the opinion, arguendo, in disposing of the first issue, that Texas had recognized the true meridian to be as located by the United States, and the two governments had declared, by official action, that it was located on the line marking the eastern boundary of four of the counties established by Texas in 1876, the proof leaving no doubt that the true meridian was immediately east of these counties-this was said, not as a determination of the exact location of the true meridian for the purpose of a precise adjudication, but merely as one of the reasons leading to the general conclusion that under the treaty of 1819 the boundary was intended to follow, as the parties had recognized, the line of the true meridian and not the location laid down on Melish's map. This is emphasized and made clear by the terms of the decree, which merely adjudged, in general terms, that the land lying east of the meridian and between the two forks was not the property of Texas, but within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; and neither adjudged that the true meridian followed the Jones, Brown and Clark line nor otherwise fixed its precise location.\n The effect of a decree as an adjudication conclusive upon the parties, is not to be determined by isolated passages in the opinion considering the rights of the parties, but upon an examination of the issues made and intended \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 43]\n\u00a0\n to be submitted, and which it was intended to decide. Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 \nU.S. 259, 272\n, 273 S., 34 S. Ct. 95; United Shoe Mach. Co. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451, 460\n, 42 S. Ct. 363.\n Thus tested, the effect of the decree in so far as it related to the western boundary of the tract in dispute, was merely that it followed the line of the true meridian. In other words, the location of the boundary along the true meridian was left in the same situation under the decree as that of the south bank of Red River and of the South Fork. Each was declared in general terms to be the boundary; but the precise location of neither was adjudged. It was later held by this Court that while so much of this decree as adjudged that the boundary between the territories of the United States and Texas followed the south bank of Red River and of the South Fork was res judicata and conclusive upon the parties, Oklahoma v. Texas, \n256 \nU.S. 70, 93\n, 41 S. Ct. 420, it still needed to be determined what constituted the south bank of the river and where along that bank the true boundary line was to be located. Oklahoma v. Texas, \n256 \nU.S. 602, 608\n, 41 S. Ct. 539. And so, while the decree likewise conclusively determined that the boundary line between Texas and the territories of the United States followed the line of the true 100th meridian from its intersection with the South Fork of Red River, it was, for like reason, not an adjudication as to the precise location of the meridian line, but left this matter open and undetermined.\n This was clearly recognized by the Act of Congress of 1901, which recited, not only that it had been adjudged by this Court that the treaty of 1819 'referred to the true one hundredth meridian astronomically located,' but that 'the true intersection of this meridian' with the South Fork of Red River had not been fixed either by the United States and Texas, acting together, or by the decree; and directed the Secretary of the Interior to cause the 'intersection of the true meridian' with the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 44]\n\u00a0\n South Fork to be established. And the recognition of the fact that the precise location of the boundary line along the meridian had not been definitely determined nor settled, was the basis not only of the subsequent recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior for the settlement of the boundary, but of the reports of the House committees recommending legislation for running and marking the line.\n\n 2. \nThe contentions that the Jones, Brown and Clark line has been recognized and adopted as the location of the 100th meridian for a long course of years and is established as the boundary by acquiescence and the exercise of jurisdiction, are made by Oklahoma alone, and not by the United States.\n It is well settled that governments, as well as private persons, are bound by the practical line that has been recognized and adopted as their boundary, Missouri v. Iowa, 7 How. 660, 670; New Mexico v. Colorado, \n267 \nU.S. 30, 40\n, 45 S. Ct. 202; and that a boundary line between two governments which has been run out, located and marked upon the earth, and afterwards recognized and acquiesced in by them for a long course of years, is conclusive, even if it be ascertained that it varies somewhat from the correct course, the line so established taking effect, in such case, as a definition of the true and ancient boundary, Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 522\n, 13 S. Ct. 728; Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 30 S. Ct. 268; New Mexico v. Colorado, supra at page 40 (45 S. Ct. 202). We find, however, upon the facts, that the Jones, Brown and Clark line has not been established as the boundary line by any such long continued recognition and acquiescence.\n The original Jones and Brown line was not run for the purpose of marking the boundary between Texas and the Territories of the United States under any authority from Congress, but was located under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs merely to mark the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 45]\n\u00a0\n boundary of certain Indian lands. The retracement and re-establishment of this line, as it had been extended by Clark in 1860, and the subdivision of the public lands into townships closing on it, between 1872 and 1875, was merely the action of the Land Department. Congress itself did not in any manner recognize this line as constituting the boundary of Texas.\n And although the Texas Legislature in 1876 established five new counties in which the calls for monuments and mile posts on 'the one hundredth meridian' evidently referred to the Jones, Brown and Clark line, it is apparent that these calls were inserted merely as a description of the boundaries of the new counties and not as a recognition of this line as constituting the eastern boundary of the State itself, since one of these monuments and two of these mile posts were within the forks of the Red River and between three of these new counties and 'Greer County,' which the Legislature had created sixteen years before, and over which Texas was continuing to assert jurisdiction. In 1882, the report of the Secretary of the Interior called attention to the fact that no part of the boundary survey had ever been officially agreed upon or accepted by the two governments as contemplated by the Act of Congress. In the same year the Texas Legislature asserted that it was necessary to run and mark the course of the Red River to the 100th meridian, as laid down on Melish's map, in order to settle the true location of the meridian and determine whether the north or south fork was the true Red River, and that a monument should be established where the meridian crossed the River as a corner in the boundary. In 1885 Congress declared that the point where the 100th meridian crossed the River, as described in the treaty, had never been ascertained and fixed by any authority competent to bind the United States and Texas, and that the existing controversy and the boundary them in dispute because of a difference of \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 46]\n\u00a0\n opinion as to this crossing should be settled. In 1891, although the surveys made by Clark, under the Act of 1858, of the Western and northern boundary lines of Texas, were 'confirmed' both by Congress and by the Texas Legislature, neither confirmed his survey of the eastern boundary line. In 1892 Texas separately employed Pritchett to establish the intersection of the meridian with the River. In 1901, after it had been settled by the decision in the Greer County Case that the boundary line followed the South Fork of the River to its intersection with the true meridian, Congress declared that the true intersection of this meridian with the South Fork had not been fixed and directed that it be established and a monument erected. This was done by Kidder in 1902, and reported by the Secretary of the Interior as a determination and establishment of the true intersection. The Texas Legislature in 1903 declared that Kidder had duly fixed the intersection of the true meridian with the River, and that his monument properly marked the boundary and should be 'accepted as correct.' And from that time to the filing of its counterclaim in 1920 Texas never abandoned this contention, or recognized in any manner the Jones, Brown and Clark line as the boundary; while, on the other hand, the Secretary of the Interior not only approved Kidder's location of the true intersection, but in 1907 recommended that it be 'accepted as correct' in establishing the boundary. And finally, in 1919, the Texas Legislature specifically asserted the existence of a controversy concerning the boundary line.\n These facts, in our opinion, demonstrate that from the running of the Jones, Brown and Clark line in 1859 and 1860 to the filing of the counterclaim by Texas in 1920, there was no period of time, either before or after the decision in the Greer County Case, in which Texas and the United States or the State of Oklahoma, recognized and acquiesced in the Jones, Brown and Clark line as the estab- \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 47]\n\u00a0\n lished boundary, and fall far short of showing its practical adoption. On the contrary the course of the legislation, on both sides, instead of treating the boundary as settled and acquiesced in, dealt with it as a matter requiring settlement. Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158, 172\n, 38 S. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258.\n Nor is the fact, as to which the parties have stipulated, that since the decision in the Greer County Case the United States, and the Territory and State of Oklahoma in succession have continuously enforced their civil and criminal laws over the territory in dispute, sufficient to establish Oklahoma's claim to this territory by prescription. The general principle of public law that as between states long acquiescence in the possession of territory under a claim of right and in the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the rightful authority, Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 638; Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 \nU.S. 479, 510\n, 10 S. Ct. 1051; Virginia v. Tennessee, supra at page 522 (13 S. Ct. 728); Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 53\n, 26 S. Ct. 408; Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 30 S. Ct. 268, a principle by which prescription founded on length of time is regarded as establishing an incontestible right-does not apply here.\n Without determining whether the period of twenty-four years which intervened between the decision in the Greer County Case and the filing of the counterclaim, could under any circumstances be a sufficient foundation for a prescriptive right-this being a much shorter period than that involved in any of the cases cited-it suffices to say that even during this period there has been neither a continuous assertion of a claim of right on the one side, nor an acquiescence therein upon the other. Within five years after this decision, while the United States still had paramount jurisdiction as to the boundaries of the Territory of Oklahoma, Congress specifically declared that the true intersection of the meridian with the South Fork of the River, which had been adjudicated as a corner in the \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 48]\n\u00a0\n boundary between Texas and the Territory, had not as yet been fixed- thereby disavowing the Jones and Brown initial monument as an established corner-and directed that the true intersection be established. Thereafter Kidder having established this intersection, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, at a point about three-quarters of a mile east of the Jones and Brown monument, the Texas Legislature immediately asserted and has continued to assert that his monument correctly located the true intersection and properly marked the boundary. And, on the other hand, although Congress did not accept the Kidder monument as correct, it did not at any time assert any claim that the jurisdiction of the United States extended to the Jones, Brown and Clark line.\n It is plain that, under these circumstances, essential elements necessary to the establishment of a prescriptive right by an exercise of jurisdiction acquiesced in for a long period of years, are lacking.\n\n 3. \nOn the other hand we cannot sustain the contention made by Texas that a line running north from the Kidder monument is the recognized and established boundary. The Act of Congress of 1901, while recognizing, in effect, that the true intersection of the meridian with the South Fork of the River is a corner in the boundary, merely directed that this point be established and marked by a monument, and did not authorize the establishment of the boundary line running northwardly from this monument. Thereafter, despite the facts that Kidder's monument was approved by the Secretary of the Interior and reported by him as a determination of the true intersection; that the Texas Legislature accepted Kidder's monument as properly marking the boundary; that the Secretary of the Interior caused Kidder to ascertain and mark the point where the line of the meridian intersected the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes, and show the discrepancy \n\n[272 U.S. 21, 49]\n\u00a0\n between the meridian and the Jones, Brown and Clark line; that the Secretary submitted drafts of two bills for the running and marking of the boundary line, one of which specifically provided that Kidder's monument should be accepted as correct; and that various other bills and resolutions were from time to time introduced in the House of Representatives for the same purpose, some of which were recommended for passage by the committees to which they were referred-Congress nevertheless took no further action as to this matters, and neither accepted Kidder's monument as the correct location of the intersection of the true meridian and the South Fork, nor provided for the establishment and marking of the boundary northwardly therefrom. It is entirely clear that under these circumstances the line running north from the Kidder monument-which has never been run or marked upon the ground-cannot be regarded as the established boundary acquiesced in and adopted by the parties.\n\n 4. \nOn the entire case our conclusions therefore are: that neither the Jones, Brown and Clark line, nor a line running north from the Kidder monument has been established as the boundary line; that the boundary is the line of the true 100th meridian extending north from its intersection with the south bank of the South Fork of Red River to its intersection with the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes; and that this line should now be accurately located and marked by a commissioner or commissioners appointed by the court, whose report shall be subject to its approval.\n The parties may submit within thirty days the form of a decree to carry these conclusions into effect. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 Stat. 252. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 Stat. 372. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Treaties and Convenions of the United States, p. 1779. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Joint Res. 5 Stat. 797; Joint Res. 9 Stat. 108. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 9 Stat. 446, c. 49; 2 Sayles' Early Laws of Texas, p. 267; President's Proclamation, 9 Stat. 1005. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] See copy of Melish's map, \n162 \nU.S. 1, 52\n, 16 S.

The claimant had private contracts to execute in which it could use this way, and which were thus delayed. The negotiation as to this way took place before the contract was drafted and executed. The contract provided for a compensation board to fix the cost, and specified elements of cost to be considered, including a proper proportion for loss resulting from displacement of, or delay, in work contracted for prior to the date of the contract caused by or attributed to work under emergency conditions by the contractor for the government, and items similar thereto in principle. The Court of Claims held that all the items of the claim were covered by the decision and award of the board, except one for $1,500, for which it gave judgment. On the findings and the contract we hold the conclusion correct, deny the motion to remand, and affirm the judgment. \n\n[271 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n No. 240.\n The Kenilworth Company leased its hotel as Asheville to the government for five months for use as a hospital, with a restriction that it should not be used for the purpose of receiving for treatment any person having tuberculosis in any form or any other like contagious or obnoxious disease, provided, however, that this should not apply to a patient housed temporarily in the premises for the purpose of an operation or the like. The suit was for breach of this restriction. The finding of the Court of Claims showed that no tuberculosis cases as such were received, and that the only ones actually housed were brought in for the purpose of an operation or the like. It was also alleged by the claimant that syphilitic cases were treated in the hospital. The finding of the court was that such cases were not contagious within the meaning of the contract and denied the claim for damages. There is nothing in the record or in the other findings on which we can reach a different conclusion. We deny the motion to remand for further findings and affirm the judgment.\n No. 241.\n The Dorris Motor Car Company had a contract with the government for the manufacture of Liberty motor governors and petrol air pumps. The contract provided for its cancellation by the government in the event of the termination of the war or in anticipation thereof, upon 30 days' notice and payment for all articles delivered during the contract and the 30-day period. The Ordinance Department notified the contractor to suspend operations under the contract December 14, 1918. The general manager of the claimant discussed the question of termination with the local claims board at St. Louis, which declined to recommend payment for anything un- \n\n[271 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n less the suspension was accepted. Thereupon a complete settlement was made, and the amount agreed upon paid. There was a reservation in the settlement, which by no reasonable construction could include the claim here made. The claim was for profit for what might have been made in the 3 days. The Court of Claims held that the claim must fail by reason of the executed settlement and we affirm that judgment.\n Valuable time was taken in hearing these cases. After arguments on behalf of the claimants, we declined to hear the other side because the correctness of the judgments of the Court of Claims was clear. It is fortunate for all that, under the Act of February 13, 1925 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1172a), judgments of the Court of Claims entered after May 13, 1925, can only be reviewed here after a showing of merits. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUTHERLAND v. MAYER(1926)\nNo. 231\nArgued: April 14, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Private rights and duties are affected by war only so far as they are incompatible with rights of war.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., and Dean Hill Stanley and E. N. Cherrington, Sp. Asst. Attys. Gen., for Sutherland.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for Mayer.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 272, 281]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Caldwell Myers, of New York City (Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, of counsel), for Reis and others.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 272, 284]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are several appeals from a decree of the court below affirming in part and reversing in part a decree of the federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The suit was brought by the Alien Property Custodian against Richard Mayer, a naturalized citizen of the United States, two corporations, organized under Massachusetts law, Karl B. Strauss, a naturalized subject of Great Britain, and Edwin Reis and Anny Reis, in her own right as widow and as trustee for two minor children of Ludwig Reis, deceased, citizens and inhabitants of Germany, for an accounting in respect of the interest of Mayer and the German citizens in certain assets in the United States in Mayer's possession and assets in Germany in the possession of the Germans, alleged to belong to a partnership consisting of Mayer, Edwin Reis, Karl B. Strauss and Ludwig Reis.\n The partnership was formed some time prior to the declaration of war against Germany on April 6, 1917, and was existing at that time. Mayer contributed to the partnership his American business, worth slightly over 206,000 marks-less than $50,000. The German partners contributed about 2, 655,000 marks. By the partnership agreement, after payment of 4 1\/2 per cent. on the capital contributed and stipulated salaries, Mayer was to receive 20 per cent. of the profits, to be credited to his capital account. The partnership agreement was made in Germany, and the principal seat of the partnership was at Friedrichsfeld, Germany, with branches at Manchester, England, and in Boston. At the time of the declaration \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 285]\n\u00a0\n of war, the partnership assets in Mayer's possession had grown to a little over $910,000, and his share in the European assets amounted to 2,414,056. 12 marks. Of the amount in Mayer's possession, between $500,000 and $600, 000 consisted of a balance remaining out of $2,500,000 sent to him by the German partners for the purpose of buying cotton waste.\n After the declaration of war, the American assets were seized by the Alien Property Custodian; but in a suit brought against that officer they were ordered redelivered to Mayer upon the ground that he had a lien upon them for his share of the partnership capital and profits. Mayer v. Garvan ( D. C.) 270 F. 229, affirmed (C. C. A.) 278 F. 27. The value of the assets returned to Mayer was $828,072.72; losses having occurred which are not material to the present consideration.\n In that case the court held that under the partnership agreement Mayer was entitled upon distribution to have out of the assets of the partnership the amount of his capital investment together with 20 per cent. of the net profits earned by the partnership, and was liable for 20 per cent. of all losses. There was, however, no evidence of the actual value of the American property or of the German of English property, nor of the liabilities of the firm; and this suit for an accounting followed. It is not disputed that the custodian is entitled to the American assets after deducting therefrom the amount of Mayer's share in all the assets.\n The German partners entered an appearance in the present suit, and produced at the hearing all the account books. The property in Manchester had been seized by the English government and sold, leaving debts on account of the English branch, amounting to 35,000, which were either paid or assumed by the German partners. The District Court found that a few days prior to the declaration of war the value of the German mark in the \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 286]\n\u00a0\n currency of the United States, according to the rate of exchange then quoted, was about 18 cents. Thereafter no rate of exchange was quoted until July 17, 1919, at which time the exchange value of the German mark was 7 7\/8 cents. Thereafter, its value steadily declined, until at the time of the act of Congress (42 Stat. 105) declaring the state of war at an end on July 2, 1921, it was 1.35 cents, and when the hearing was begun in the present case its value was .0048 of a dollar. The District Court determined that the German partners should account for Mayer's share of the German assets at their value on April 6, 1917, the American assets to be measured in terms of the American gold dollar, and the German assets correspondingly in terms of the German gold mark, which is the equivalent of 23.82 cents of the money of the United States; and upon this basis the decree was entered. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the decree, adopted the same view. Sub nom. Miller v. Mayer (C. C. A.) 1 F. (2d) 419. And this presents the principal questing in the case and the only one requiring extended consideration.\n Appellants in Nos. 232 and 234 unite in the contention that the declaration of war did not affect the title to the partnership property; that, although the partnership was thereby dissolved, the partners must suffer ratably from any depreciation in the value of the German assets after the dissolution and before the accounting; and that the accounting must be made upon the basis of the value of such assets at the time of the accounting, the value of the mark being taken at its then rate of exchange.\n That the declaration of a state of war immediately effected a dissolution of the partnership is well settled and is not in dispute. It is likewise settled that during the war all intercourse, correspondence and traffic between citizens of this country and of Germany which would or might be to the advantage of the enemy, were absolutely forbidden. Conrad v. Waples, \n96 U.S. 279\n, 287; Briggs \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 287]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 346, 353\n, 12 S. Ct. 391. The effect of War Trade Regulations No. 802, July 14, 1919, and No. 814, July 20, 1919, we shall consider further along.\n The reasons for, and the limitations upon, the rule have been frequently stated. War between nations is war between their individual citizens. All intercourse inconsistent with a condition of hostility is interdicted (The Rapid, 8 Cranch, 155, 162, 163), for fear that it may give aid or comfort to, or add to the resources of, the enemy. Moreover, as said by this court in United States v. Lane, 8 Wall. 185, 195:\n'If commercial intercourse were allowable, it would oftentimes be used as a color for intercourse of an entirely different character; and in such a case the mischievous consequences that would ensue can be readily foreseen.'\n\n But war is abnormal and exceptional; and, while the supreme necessities which it imposes require that, in many respects, the rules which govern the relations of the respective citizens of the belligerent powers in time of peace must be modified or entirely put aside, there is no tendency in our day at least to extend them to results clearly beyond the need and the duration of the need. The purpose of the restriction is not arbitrarily and unnecessarily to tie the hands of the individuals concerned, but to preclude the possibility of aid or comfort, direct or indirect, to the opposing forces. It is that purpose which gives birth to the rule and indicates its limits. The rule is simply 'a belligerent's weapon of self-protection.' Daimler Co. v. Continental Tyre, etc., Co., ( 1916) 2 A. C. 307, 344. And it applies even where the trading is with a loyal citizen, if he be resident in the enemy's country, since the result of his action may be to furnish resources to the enemy. Id., 319; Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Mines, (1902) A. C. 484, 505. The whole tendency of modern law and practice is to soften the 'ancient severities of war,' and to recognize, increasingly, \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 288]\n\u00a0\n that the normal interrelations of the citizens of the respective belligerents are not to be interfered with when such interference is unnecessary to the successful prosecution of the war. Private rights and duties are affected by war only so far as they are incompatible with the rights of war. See, generally, Kershaw v. Kelsey, 100 Mass. 561. 568-574, 97 Am. Dec. 124, 1 Am. Rep. 142, where the question is elaborately reviewed in an opinion by Mr. Justice Gray which has several times received the approval of this court; Briggs v. United States, supra, page 353 (12 S. Ct. 391); Williams v. Paine, \n169 \nU.S. 55, 72\n, 18 S. Ct. 279; Birge-Forbes Co. v. Heye, \n251 \nU.S. 317, 323\n, 40 S. Ct. 160.\n Thus, where a contract has been performed before the advent of war and nothing remains but the payment of money, the right to collect is not destroyed, but only the remedy suspended until the termination of the war. Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 537; Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 123; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Statham, \n93 U.S. 24\n, 31; Crutcher v. Hord and wife, 67 Ky. 360, 366; Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Hillyard, 37 N. J. Law, 444, 465, 18 Am. Rep. 741. Agencies, created before the war, and not requiring intercourse across the enemy's frontier, such as for the collection of debts, preservation of property, and so forth, are not terminated by war. See, generally, Ward v. Smith, 7 Wall. 447, 452, 453; Quigley's Case, 13 Ct. Cl. 367, 371; Anderson v. Bank, 1 Fed. Cases 838, No. 354; Lamar v. Micou, \n112 \nU.S. 452, 464\n, 5 S. Ct. 221. And in the case of contracts made before the war for the delivery of goods, it is entirely lawful to make delivery during the war within the United States. The thing forbidden is placing property or money within the power of the enemy-\n'not in delivering it to an alien enemy, or his agent, residing here, under the control of our own government. ... In such a case, the interests of commerce are perfectly compatible with the rights of war; and public policy does not forbid the transfer.' Buchanan v. Curry, 19 Johns. (N. Y.) 137, 141 (10 Am. Dec. 200).\n\n And so here we have to deal, not with a contract made during the war or requiring commercial or other inter- \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 289]\n\u00a0\n course across military lines, but with an adjustment of rights, after the restoration of peace, under lawful articles of partnership entered into before, and existing at the outbreak of, the war. The advent of a state of war put an end to the partnership and postponed all remedies relating to the dissolution; but it did not petrify rights and duties resulting therefrom. Its effect only was to suspend the enforcement of the obligation of each of the partners in respect of the assets and past transactions of the partnership; and the essential inquiry now is: What was the obligation which resulted from the dissolution?\n Upon the dissolution of a partnership, the general rule is that the liquidating partner or partners must settle up the partnership affairs within a reasonable time, and, after payment of the partnership debts and liabilities, divide the proceeds among the partners according to their interests. Clay v. Field, \n138 \nU.S. 464, 473\n, 11 S. Ct. 419. The rule is not different because the dissolution is the result of war. Stevenson & Sons v. Aktiengesellschaft, etc., (1918) A. C. 239, 246. But in the case of such a dissolution, in the absence of legislation to the contrary, a settlement is legally impossible until the close of the war, because of the rule forbidding intercourse across the enemy's frontier and denying access by enemy citizens to our courts; although it is entirely compatible with the rule to recognize the right and duty of the enemy partners to care for and preserve the assets of the copartnership in the possession of each for their mutual benefit when the war has ended. To say otherwise, because an enemy may realize a benefit after the war has come to an end, is utterly to misapply the principle upon which the nonintercourse rule is based and to confound the suspension of the remedy with the loss of the right.\n'The prohibition against doing anything for the benefit of an enemy contemplates his benefit during the war and not the possible advantage he may gain when peace comes.' Daimler Co. v. Conti- \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 290]\n\u00a0\n nental Tyre, etc., Co., supra, page 347; Stevenson & Sons v. Aktiengesellschaft, etc., supra, pages 249, 253, 254.\n\n In the present case, the adjustment of the account as among the partners is a matter in which the government-the war and the exigencies of the war having passed-is no longer concerned, save as its rights and duties are represented by the Alien Property Custodian. Except for the latter consideration, we are dealing with a simple suit for an accounting among partners, to be determined by the application of equitable principles. Stevenson & Sons v. Aktiengesellschaft, etc., supra, page 248. The effect upon these principles of the dissolution of the partnership by war is certainly no greater than if it had been dissolved by death or agreement. Buchanan v. Curry, supra, pages 142, 143. In either event the relation created by the dissolution in respect of the assets is a fiduciary relation, and adjustments of rights and liabilities of the partners inter se are to be made in accordance with the rules governing such relationships; and in a court of equity the American partner, ipso facto, has no such exceptional privilege as will permit him to secure more favorable consideration than that to be accorded to his alien partners.\n The argument for Mayer is that the German partners should be treated as having purchased the German assets on April 6, 1917, and compelled to account for Mayer's interest therein upon that basis and as of that date. In support of that contention we are referred to the record in the original case of Mayer v. Garvan, supra, of which the District Court in the present case took judicial notice. That record has not been before us; but we accept the statements contained in Mayer's brief in respect of its disclosures, since they do not seem to be challenged by the other parties. We are of opinion, however, that they fall short of establishing a situation for applying the theory of a purchase of the German assets by the German partners. \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 291]\n\u00a0\n Undoubtedly, the German partners, instead of liquidating, continued to use the assets after the dissolution in a going business, commingling old assets with new; also they took in a new partner. The Court of Appeals said, and evidence is quoted from the Garvan record to the effect, that the assets were taken over by the German partners and thereafter treated as their own. The evidence before us in the present record is to the effect that the business in Germany was carried on during the war as it had been before; that Mayer's share of the profits was credited to him annually in the private ledger at Friedrichsfeld; and that a sum sufficent to pay out Mayer's capital interest, as shown by the books, was continuously carried on deposit in banks.\n Precisely what are the facts in respect of this matter we need not stop to determine, because, in view of the conclusion we have reached, it is not material whether the German partners treated the business as their own or as that of the old partnership. The partnership was at an end; and their duty was to liquidate. They could not carry on the business in any form so as to bind Mayer. But Mayer must elect either to accept what was actually done with the burdens and benefits or to enforce against his German partners a liability based upon what they should have done. The decision below and Mayer's attitude apparently proceed upon the latter alternative, and in that view, in an ordinary case, he could justly be given no more than what he would have obtained if the liquidation had in fact been made within a reasonable time and the amount of his share promptly paid over to him. Precisely at this point the contention in Mayer's behalf breaks down, for it ignores the circumstance, which differentiates this from the ordinary case, that, even if the assets and been promptly liquidated, nothing could have been paid to Mayer until after the removal or expiration of the nonintercourse bar. Until that time, the amount \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 292]\n\u00a0\n coming to Mayer necessarily would have been held by the German partners in the form of German currency, or of securities or a bank account payable in such currency, and the loss, so far as Mayer is concerned, would have resulted none the less.\n In this connection the fact may not be disregarded that the German partners dealt with a situation under the abnormal restraints and perplexities of war; and it is fair to interpret what they did in the light of that situation. So viewed, we are unable to conclude that their acts were hostile to Mayer's ultimate rights or inconsistent with an honest effort to do the best possible thing with the property until the close of the war, utilizing it, in the meantime, in a way which they conceived to be to the best advantage of all concerned. It is clear that no loss was sustained by the continuance of the business; but, on the contrary, there was an asset gain. The great loss, which finally resulted, and which was little short of being complete, was due entirely to the depreciation in the value of the German mark and not to any lack of care or good faith on their part. Moreover, with the exception of plant and machinery, relatively of small vlaue, the German assets during the entire time were in the form of German paper currency or securities, bills peceivable, etc., convertible only into German paper currency, since there was no gold in circulation and the paper currency was by German law legal tender.\n In whatever aspect the case is viewed or upon whatever basis the liability of the German partners be made to rest, the loss, in the final analysis, was an ineluctable consequence of the war. Is it to be borne by them alone or to be shared equally by all the partners as a common misfortune beyond the power of any of them to turn aside? That question justly cannot be solved by a strict enforcement of the ordinary rule as in ordinary cases, for here we are dealing with extraordinary and anoma- \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 293]\n\u00a0\n lous conditions, as a result of which money values were swept away by immense causes as much beyond the sway of the German partners as of Mayer, Blame for such a situation rests upon neither; and equality is equity.\n This would appear more clearly if there were no American assets and the German assets were alone concerned. In that event, a decree compelling the German partners to account to Mayer upon the basis of the full value of these assets at the outbreak of the war in terms of gold, notwithstanding the destructive force of these unavoidable circumstances, would be so obviously harsh and inequitable as to shock the conscience of the Chancellor. But the equities are not different because Mayer chances also to have in his possession partnership assets-the greater part of which, it may be said in passing, had been sent to him by the German partners for trade purposes-which, by reason of the more fortunate state of American finances, had preserved their original monetary value.\n Upon the whole, we think the case is fairly ruled in principle by Clay v. Field, supra. In that case, the property of the partnership consisted of a plantation in Tennessee. Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, one of the partners died. The surviving partner continued, after his partner's death, to retain possession of the plantation, together with the slaves upon it, and to operate the property in good faith. When the war came a year or two later, the plantation was in the theater of conflict, and at the close of the war the slaves had become free. The court recognized the general rule, as we have already stated it, that it was the survivor's duty to settle up the partnership affairs within a reasonable time and pay over to the representatives of the deceased partner the amount due them. And the court proceeded to say (pages 473, 474 (11 S. Ct. 423)) that:\n'If he (the survivor) takes the responsibility of continuing the business of the firm, and using the property \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 294]\n\u00a0\n of the partnership, he becomes liable for losses that may occur, and it is in the option of the representatives of the deceased partner either to insist upon a division of the profits, which may be made in thus carrying on the business, or upon being paid the amount of the deceased's share in the capital, with lawful interest thereon, after deducting his indebtedness to the firm.'\n\n Strictly applied, the court said, the rule would entitle the representatives to call for an account of the share of the deceased at the time of his death with lawful interest. But, in view of the anomalous circumstances and unexpected events, the court declined to enforce the rule, saying (page 474 (11 S. Ct. 423)):\n'In our view, equity, when called upon to settle the mutual rights of the parties, may very properly mitigate the hardships of the rule, especially when, as in this case, the loss has occurred by public war.'\n\n It was recognized that the survivor-\n'might have sold the slaves and other property on terms which, in the light of subsequent events, would have been greatly to the advantage of his brother's estate, yet it seems clear from the evidence that the reason he did not sell was that no opportunity offered of effecting a sale of the plantation at what he deemed an adequate price.'\n\n Under all the circumstances, this court agreed with the trial court that it would be a very hard application of the general rule relating to a dissolution of partnership to compel the survivor or his estate to account for the value of the slaves, which, in a short time, were freed by operation of law and no longer articles of property. It was therefore held that the surviving partner was not accountable for the value of the slaves, but was accountable for the fair rental value of the property, including that of the slaves while they were slaves. See, also, Tate v. Norton, \n94 \nU.S. 746, 747\n, 748 S..\n Here the case for the German partners, if anything, is stronger; for, during the nonintercourse period, there never was a time when, so far as appears, Mayer's share \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 295]\n\u00a0\n could have been converted into anything but German marks, or when it was legally possible to pay the amount to Mayer. As soon as the nonintercourse restriction ceased to be operative, however, such payment became lawful, and an obligation arose on the part of the German partners to make it, since Mayer's share, long prior to that time, had been identified and was separable from the body of the assets. It was, in effect, a trust fund, in respect of which the German partners then owed the duty of prompt settlement. The war was formally declared to be at an end by the Act of July 2, 1921; but the right of commercial intercourse and of communication between citizens of this country and Germany was restored by the War Trade Board regulation of July 14, 1919, as amended July 20, 1919. We therefore conclude that the German partners should be charged with the amount of Mayer's share of the German assets at the exchange value of the German mark on July 14, 1919. The evidence in the record shows that on July 17th, three days later, the exchange value was 7 7\/8 cents, which seems near enough to the designated date. The depreciation of the German mark was so great that to compute its American monetary value on a nominal par basis would be to indulge in a pure fiction; and exchange values must be resorted to as the only available method of measurement. The conclusion that the exchange value of marks in American money is to be taken as of the time when commercial intercourse, and therefore settlement, first became lawful, rather than at the time of the accounting, finds support, by analogy, in many decisions. See, for example, Hicks v. Guinness, \n269 \nU.S. 71, 80\n, 46 S. Ct. 46; S. S. Celia v. S. S. Volturno, ( 1921) 2 A. C. 544; In re British American Continental Bank (1922) 2 Ch. 575; Socie te des Hotels v. Cumming, (1921) 3 K. B. 459; Di Ferdinando v. Simon, Smits & Co., (1920) 3 K. B. 409; Lebeaupin v. Crispin, (1920) 2 K. B. 714.\n In fixing the date upon which exchange should be calculated, the inevitable delay which must result before a \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 296]\n\u00a0\n judicial taking of the account must be given weight. If the liability be treated as having crystallized at the time indicated above, them a definite date is fixed for the ascertainment of exchange, and the amount when found may be awarded without regard to the fluctuations in the possible date of accounting. Lebeaupin v. Crispin, supra, page 723. In England the rule has been applied in a winding-up proceeding upon the ground that a date must necessarily be fixed on which liabilities are to be treated as definitely ascertained for the purpose of properly conducting the later winding-up of the company's affairs. In re British American Continental Bank, supra, p. 582. And the rule is the same whether the contract is to be performed in England or out of England, on the ground that there should not be varying rules in such cases. Lebeaupin v. Crispin, supra, p. 723.\n The remaining questions in dispute require only brief consideration.\n The District Court held that it was impossible to calculate the profits which should be equitably assigned to Mayer's share in the German assets, and that, since there could be no payment to him during the period of nonintercourse, interest could not be allowed him upon such share- applying the rule laid down in Brown v. Hiatt, 15 Wall. 177. But the question there arose in respect of a debt which became payable during the progress of the Civil War, and the court held that, since the debt could not be paid until the termination of the war, interest upon it could not be exacted. Here we are not dealing with the question of interest upon a debt, or really with interest at all except as a term of convenience, but with that of an allowance in lieu of unascertainable profits, to which the rule in the Hiatt Case has no application. Stevenson & Sons v. Aktiengesellschaft, etc., supra, page 256. An award should have been made to Mayer, calculated upon the basis of interest in lieu of profits. \n\n[271 U.S. 272, 297]\n\u00a0\n The District Court allowed the German partners a credit for 266,432. 40 marks paid by them to the German government during the war for taxes levied against Mayer's partnership interest in 1914, 1915, and 1916. It appears that, if the tax had not been paid, Mayer's share would have been liable to seizure by the tax collector. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the District Court and disallowed the item. The obligation was one which apparently arose before the war, and, in the view we have taken of the relation of the German partners to Mayer's interest in the assets, we think the payment was properly made to protect the fund, and that the District Court was right in allowing credit for it.\n Payments made during the war to relatives of Mayer do not rest upon like considerations; and we agree with the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in disallowing them. These payments were based upon directions, said to be of a continuing character, given before the war; but which were brought to an end by the advent of war. This results, not on the ground that the payments were contrary to public policy, but upon the ground that the outbreak of hostilities produced such a fundamental alteration in the relations of the parties that we cannot assume a continuance of authority to make such payments in the absence of evidence of Mayer's assent thereto. Insurance Co. v. Davis, \n95 U.S. 425\n, 429. Williams v. Paine, supra, page 73 (18 S. Ct. 279).\n In respect of other items, either allowed Mayer or disallowed the German partners, we see no reason to differ with the conclusions of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYLOR v. VOSS(1926)\nNo. 199\nArgued: Decided: May 3, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 176, 178]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. H. Ortmeyer, of Evansville, Ind., and Harold Taylor, of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioners.\n Mr. Henry B. Walker, of Evansville, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In December, 1921, Wilbur Erskine, a married man, residing and owning real estate in Indiana, was adjudged a bankrupt on his voluntary petition in the federal District Court for the State. In February, 1922, the respondent Voss was appointed the trustee in bankruptcy. In March, before any sale of the real estate, the bankrupt's wife, Mary E. Erskine, died testate, leaving by her will her entire property to the petitioner Taylor, as testamentary trustee. In May, the trustee in bankruptcy, filed a petition in the bankruptcy proceeding, alleging that the testamentary trustee claimed an interest in the real estate of the bankrupt, and praying that he be required to set up this claim, and that such interest be fixed by the court and the right to sell the real estate free from such claim be declared. The testamentary trustee answered, alleging that upon the adjudication in bankruptcy Mrs. Erskine had become absolutely vested under the State laws and the Bankruptcy Act, with a wife's interest in the real estate of her husband, to which she was entitled at the time of her death; and also praying that the court fix this interest. Pending a hearing as to this claim, the real estate was sold by the trustee in bankruptcy, by consent, for $36,870; under an agreement that not less than one-fifth of the proceeds should be held by \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n him to protect whatever rights the testamentary trustee might have in the real estate, and that if the final decision should be in favor of the latter, the trustee in bankruptcy should pay over to him the amount found to be due on account of his interest in the real estate. Thereafter, the question as to the disposition of the proceeds of sale was submitted to the referee under the foregoing agreement and a stipulation as to the facts, as they have been set out. Upon this hearing the referee held that the testamentary trustee was entitled to receive one-fifth of the proceeds of sale, amounting to $7,374, and directed that this sum be paid to him by the trustee in bankruptcy. This order was confirmed by the District Judge. Within two months thereafter the trustee in bankruptcy filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Appeals for a revision of this order in matter of law, under section 24b of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9608).1 The testamentary trustee moved to dismiss this petition on the ground that it presented a controversy arising in the bankruptcy proceeding which could be reviewed only by an appeal under section 24a of the Act. The Court of Appeals denied this motion, on the ground that while the petition presented such a controversy, the matter might nevertheless be considered as though it had been brought up by appeal, in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Jurisdictional Act of 1916 (Comp. St.  1649a).2 And, thus considering the matter, the court held, that upon the death of Mrs. Erskine before the real estate had been sold, all her right therein had been extinguished, and no interest had passed to the testamentary trustee; and accordingly reversed the order of the District Court. Voss v. Taylor, 1 F.(2d) 149. This writ of certiorari was then granted. \n267 \nU.S. 588\n, 45 S. Ct. 352.\n The contentions of the testamentary trustee are: (1) That the Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n review the order of the District Court under the petition for revision; and (2) that, even if such jurisdiction existed, the decree reversing that order was erroneous as a matter of law.\n\n 1. \nThe first of these contentions requires a consideration of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act dealing with the review of proceedings in courts of bankruptcy in the exercise of the appellate and supervisory jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of Appeals.\n By section 24a of the Act the Circuit Courts of Appeals are 'invested with appellate jurisdiction of controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy.' By section 24b they are given jurisdiction 'to superintend and revise in matter of law the proceedings of the several inferior courts of bankruptcy ... on due notice and petition by any party aggrieved.' And by section 25a (Comp. St.  9609) it is provided that appeals 'in bankruptcy proceedings' may be taken to them, within ten days, from judgments as to adjudications of bankruptcy, discharges, and claims of five hundred dollars or over.\n These provisions-which are to be read in the light of the provision in section 23a (Comp. St.  9607) giving the District Courts, as the successors of the Circuit Courts, general jurisdiction in plenary actions of 'controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between trustees as such and adverse claimants concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees'-have given rise to much conflict of opinion in the various Circuit Courts of Appeals in respect to the distinction between 'controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings' and mere 'proceedings' in bankruptcy, and the procedure by which they may be brought up for review.\n It is now settled by the decisions of this Court, that the 'controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings' referred to in section 24a, include those matters arising in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding, which are not mere \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n steps in the ordinary administration of the bankrupt estate, but present, by intervention or otherwise, distinct and separable issues between the trustee and adverse claimants concerning the right and title to the bankrupt's estate. Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, \n194 \nU.S. 296, 300\n, 24 S. Ct. 690; Coder v. Arts, \n213 \nU.S. 223, 234\n, 29 S. Ct. 436, 16 Ann. Cas. 1008; Tefft & Co. v. Munsuri, \n222 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 32 S. Ct. 67; Swift & Co. v. Hoover, \n242 \nU.S. 107, 109\n, 37 S. Ct. 56. In such 'controversies' the decrees of the court of bankruptcy may be reviewed by appeals which bring up the whole matter and open both the facts and the law for consideration. Duryea Power Co. v. Sternbergh, \n218 \nU.S. 299, 302\n, 31 S. Ct. 25; Houghton v. Burden, \n228 \nU.S. 161, 165\n, 33 S. Ct. 491.\n On the other hand, the 'proceedings' in bankruptcy referred to in section 24b are those matters of an administrative character, including questions between the bankrupt and his creditors, which are presented in the ordinary course of the administration of the bankrupt's estate. Matter of Loving, \n224 \nU.S. 183, 188\n, 32 S. Ct. 446. In such administrative matters-as to which the courts of bankruptcy proceed in a summary way in the final settlement and distribution of the estate, U. S. Fidelity Co. v. Bray, 32 S. Ct. 620, \n225 U.S. 205\n, 218- their orders and decrees may be reviewed by petitions for revision which bring up questions of law only. Duryea Power Co. v. Sternbergh, supra, 302 ( 31 S. Ct. 25).\n It thus appears that the essential distinction between the different methods provided for reviewing the orders and decrees of the courts of bankruptcy is, that 'controversies' in bankruptcy proceedings, arising between the trustee representing the bankrupt and his creditors, on the one side, and adverse claimants on the other, affecting the extent of the estate to be distributed, may be reviewed both as to fact and law; while 'proceedings' in bankruptcy affecting merely the administration and distribution of the estate, may be reviewed in matter of law only, \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n except as to the three classes of such 'proceedings' enumerated in section 25a, as to which a short right of appeal is given, both as to fact and law. Furthermore, apart from the scope of the review permitted by the act, the distinction between an appeal and a petition for revision in the mere matter of form, is immaterial. Thus, although a petition for revision cannot be treated as an appeal for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the review so as to extend to questions of fact, Duryea Power Co. v. Sternbergh, supra, 302 (31 S. Ct. 25) where a matter which is only reviewable in law is taken up by an appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, if the question of law is sufficiently presented on the record, may treat the appeal as a petition for revision and dispose of it accordingly. Bryan v. Bernheimer, \n181 \nU.S. 188, 193\n, 21 S. Ct. 557; Holden v. Stratton, \n191 \nU.S. 115, 118\n, 119 S., 24 S. Ct. 45; Duryea Power Co. v. Sternbergh, supra, 301 (31 S. Ct. 25).\n Coming then to the procedural question involved in the present case it is clear, in the first place, that, as was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the matter presented is a 'controversy' between the trustee in bankruptcy and the testamentary trustee, as an adverse claimant, in respect to the title to the bankrupt's estate, which might have been reviewed by an appeal under section 24a of the Bankruptcy Act. Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, supra, 300 (24 S. Ct. 690); Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co., \n216 \nU.S. 545, 553\n, 30 S. Ct. 412; Houghton v. Burden, supra, 165 (33 S. Ct. 491); Greey v. Dockendorff, 34 S. Ct. 166, \n231 U.S. 513\n, 514; Globe Bank v. Martin, \n236 \nU.S. 289, 296\n, 35 S. Ct. 377; Bailey v. Baker Machinery Co., \n239 \nU.S. 268, 270\n, 36 S. Ct. 50; Moody v. Century Bank, \n239 \nU.S. 374, 377\n, 36 S. Ct. 111; Benedict v. Ratner, \n268 \nU.S. 353, 358\n, 45 S. Ct. 566. And if, under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, an appeal was the only method by which this 'controversy' could be reviewed, we think it is clear that there was no warrant for treating the petition for revision as bringing the matter up on appeal, under the provision of section 4 of the Jurisdictional Act of \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 183]\n\u00a0\n 1916, that no appellate court 'shall dismiss a writ of error solely because an appeal should have been taken, or dismiss an appeal solely because a writ of error should have been sued out.' This remedial provision, as plainly appears from the language used and the entire context, was intended to apply only to the general distinction between appeals and writs of error, obtaining from the foundation of our judicial system and cannot be extended by implication to the special provisions of the Bankruptcy Act as to appeals and petitions for revision, to which no reference whatever was made.\n On the question whether the method of reviewing a 'controversy' in bankruptcy provided by section 24a of the Bankruptcy Act, is necessarily exclusive of that provided by section 24b, that is, whether a controversy which may be reviewed both as to fact and law by an appeal under section 24a, may also, when the facts are undisputed, be reviewed in matter of law by a petition for revision under section 24b, there has been an irreconcilable conflict of decisions in the various Circuit Courts of Appeals. This has led to much confusion and to the determination of many cases upon the procedural question merely, without reference to the merits. See casses collected in 8 Remington on Bankruptcy (3d Ed.)  3704, 3706, 3734.4 \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 184]\n\u00a0\n This precise question, in the broad form in which it is now presented, has not been specifically decided by this Court. It is true that in Matter of Loving, supra, 188 (32 S. Ct. 446), there was general language, incidentally used, which if taken broadly, indicates that 'controversies' which are appealable under section 24a cannot be reviewed by petitions for revision under section 24b. But, according to a familiar rule, this language should be regarded as limited by the circumstances in which it was used. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399; Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., supra, 272 (36 S. Ct. 50). The case did not present a 'controversy' appealable under section 24a, but, as was explicitly stated, a 'proceeding' in bankruptcy relating to a proof of claim filed by a creditor, with the incidental assertion of a statutory lien, as to which a special appeal was granted by section 25a, to be taken within ten days. The trustee contested both the amount of the claim and the existence of the lien. The bankruptcy court allowed the claim for its full amount as a lien against the bankrupt estate. Thereupon, more than ten days thereafter, the trustee filed a petition for a revision of this order, abandoning his contest as to the amount of the claim, and insisting merely that there was error in matter of law in allowing the lien as security. On a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals, presenting the single question whether, under these circumstances, the order of the bankruptcy court could be reviewed upon a petition for revision, it was held that section 24b 'was not intended to give an additional remedy to those whose rights could be protected by an appeal under section 25 of the act.' And, since no question as to the effect of section 24a was presented by the certificate \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 185]\n\u00a0\n or involved in the decision, it is clear that its effect must be limited, as a controlling authority, to the holding that when the ten days had expired within which the special appeal might have been taken under section 25a, bringing up both the facts and the law, the trustee could not thereafter, by abandoning his contention of fact, obtain by a petition for revision a review of the question of law which he might have obtained by an appeal taken within the prescribed time, and thereby extend, as to the question of law, the time within which he was entitled to obtain a review of the order.\n On the other hand, in Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, supra, 299 (24 S. Ct. 690), presenting a 'controversy' in a bankruptcy proceeding in which the facts were not disputed that had been reviewed by an appeal under section 24a, it was distinctly recognized that a review might also have been had in matter of law by a petition for revision under section 24b. And it is well settled by other decisions of this Court that a 'controversy' in bankruptcy proceedings may be reviewed by a petition for revision as to some matters of law, at least. Thus, where a trustee has instituted a summary proceeding in a bankruptcy court for the recovery of property in the possession of a third person asserting a claim adverse to the bankrupt estate, a petition for revision will lie to bring up for review the question of law whether the court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of such controversy in a summary proceeding. Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18, 25\n, 22 S. Ct. 293; Schweer v. Brown, \n195 \nU.S. 171, 172\n, 25 S. Ct. 15; Galbraith v. Vallely, \n256 \nU.S. 46, 48\n, 41 S. Ct. 415; Taubel Co. v. Fox, \n264 \nU.S. 426, 429\n, 44 S. Ct. 396. An analogous rule was also applied in Weidhorn v. Levy, \n253 \nU.S. 268, 270\n, 40 S. Ct. 534. There the trustee had filed in the bankruptcy suit a bill in equity against an adverse claimant, thereby instituting a 'controversy' in the bankruptcy proceeding. The referee, over an objection to his jurisdiction, had entertained the bill and en- \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 186]\n\u00a0\n tered a final decree in favor of the trustee. The District Judge, considering the jurisdictional question alone, dismissed the bill upon the ground that the referee had exceeded his powers. This question was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals by a petition for revision, and while this court said that if the District Court had sustained the jurisdiction and passed upon the merits, the decree could only have been reviewed by an appeal-evidently referring to a review both of fact and law-it was held that 'since the decision turned upon a mere question of law as to whether the referee had authority to hear and determine the controversy-in effect a question of procedure-it properly was reviewable by petition to revise under section 24b.' And, subsequently, it was tacitly assumed by this Court, in two decisions, without question, that where trustees had instituted summary proceedings in the bankruptcy courts involving controversies with third persons asserting adverse claims to the property of the bankrupts, the Circuit Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction under petitions for revision to determine all the questions of law presented on the undisputed facts, both as to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts and the merits of the controversies; and this Court based its judgments upon a review of the questions of law thus presented, both as to the existence of summary jurisdiction and the merits. Chicago Board of Trade v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 44 S. Ct. 232; May v. Henderson, \n268 \nU.S. 111, 112\n, 45 S. Ct. 456.\n In the light of these decisions,-bearing in mind that the only distinction in matter of substance between an appeal and a petition for revision is that the one brings up for review questions both of fact and law, and the other, those of law merely, and finding nothing in the letter of the act which necessarily makes the comprehensive remedy of an appeal as to both fact and law, exclusive of the narrower remedy of a petition for revision in matter \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 187]\n\u00a0\n of law-we conclude that in a 'controversy' arising in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is not essential to a review, when the facts are undisputed or no longer questioned, that resort should be had to an appeal under section 24a; but that in such case the controlling questions of law may also be reviewed by a petition for revision under section 24b, whether they relate merely to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court or to the merits of the controversy. Such a review, however, by petition for revision, is a concurrent remedy merely, and in conformity with the decision in the Loving Case, cannot, irrespective of any other limitation, be deemed an 'additional remedy' which may be resorted to after the time for an appeal has expired. This construction of the act is, we think consistent with its letter; accords with its spirit and manifest purpose; and gives it a practical effect removing in large measure the technical question of procedure which has so greatly obstructed its efficient administration, and served in so many instances as a trap, not intended by Congress, to unwary persons enmeshed in abstruse perplexities.\n It results that, as the controversy in the present case was presented in the bankruptcy proceeding by consent of the parties, for determination as a matter of law on stipulated facts, it was properly reviewable by the Circuit Court of Appeals in such matter of law under the petition for revision.\n\n 2. \nThis brings us to the questions presented upon the merits, whether Mrs. Erskine at the time of her death was vested with any interest in the real estate of the bankrupt; and if so, the extent of such interest.\n The testamentary trutee contends, alternatively, that under the statutes of Indiana she became vested with a one-fifth interest in all the real estate when her husband was adjudged a bankrupt; or, if not, then with a lesser interest when the trustee in bankruptcy was appointed. \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 188]\n\u00a0\n The first contention is based upon the Indiana statute of descent, which provides that:\n'If a husband die ... leaving a widow, one-third of his real estate shall descend to her in fee-simple, free from all demands of creditors: Provided, however, That where the real estate exceeds in value ten thousand dollars, the widow shall have one-fourth only, and where the real estate exceeds twenty thousand dollars, one-fifth only, as against creditors.' Rev. Stat. Ind. 1881,  2483; also  2491, to the same effect.\n\n This contention lacks any substantial basis. The statute creates no estate in the wife during her husband's lifetime, but merely an inchoate and contingent interest, which depends upon her survivorship and is extinguished if she dies before him. Thompson v. McCorkle, 136 Ind. 484, 495, 497, 34 N. E. 813, 36 N. E. 211, 43 Am. St. Rep. 334; Fry v. Hare, 166 Ind. 415, 420, 77 N. E. 803. The argument that the adjudication of a husband as a bankrupt brings about his 'civil death,' so that his wife is to be regarded as a 'widow' within the meaning of the statute, vested by virtue of the adjudication with the interest in his real estate which would have descended to her if she had survived him, is inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, the language of the Indiana statute, and the decisions of the courts of the State; and the contention was rightly denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The alternative contention of the testamentary trustee is based upon the Indiana Judicial Sales Act, which provides that:\n'In all cases of judicial sales of real property in which any married woman has an inchoate interest by virtue of her marriage, ... such interest shall become absolute and vest in the wife in the same manner and to the same extent as such inchoate interest of a married woman now becomes absolute upon the death of the husband, whenever, by virtue of said sale, the legal title of the husband ... shall become absolute and vested in the purchaser thereof.'\n\n But this provision shall not \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 189]\n\u00a0\n apply to so much of such real property as exceeds in value twenty thousand dollars. Rev. Stat. Ind. 1881,  2508, 2509.5\n It is settled by repeated decisions of the Supreme Court of Indiana that under the Bankruptcy Act of 18676 a conveyance made by the judge or register in bankruptcy of the real estate of an adjudged bankrupt to his assignee in bankruptcy, was 'a judicial sale' within the meaning of the Indiana statute, and that the inchoate interest of the bankrupt's wife in such real estate thereupon became absolute and vested in her in the same manner as it would have done in case of his death. Roberts v. Shroyer, 68 Ind. 64, 67; Ketchum v. Schicketanz, 73 Ind. 137, 143; McCracken v. Kuhn, 73 Ind. 149, 151; Haggerty v. Byrne, 75 Ind. 499, 502; Lawson v. De Bolt, 78 Ind. 563, 565; Leary v. Shaffer, 79 Ind. 567, 570; Straughan v. White, 88 Ind. 242, 246; Mattill v. Baas, 89 Ind. 220, 222; Ragsdale v. Mitchell, 97 Ind. 458, 460; Mayer v. Haggerty, 138 Ind. 628, 634, 38 N. E. 42. This rule was also followed by the Federal Court in Indiana, in Warford v. Noble (C. C.) 2 F. 202, 203. In Roberts v. Shroyer, supra, 67, it was said that:\n'The foundation of all subsequent proceedings in bankruptcy, including the conveyance by the judge or register to the assignee, is the previous adjudication of the debtor's bankruptcy. That adjudication gives character to the conveyance made by the judge or register to the assignee, and makes it a judicial sale. It is judicial because it is founded on the judgment of the court ... That the conveyance thus made by the judge or register must be regarded as a sale within the meaning of our statute, we think it is equally clear.' \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 190]\n\u00a0\n In Harlin v. American Trust Co., 67 Ind. App. 213, 220, 119 N. E. 20, it was held by the Appellate Court of Indiana that these decisions applied with full force to cases arising under the present Bankruptcy Act, and that an adjudication in bankruptcy followed by the appointment of a trustee, in whom, under section 70 of the act (Comp. St.  9654), title to the bankrupt's property was vested by operation of law, likewise operated as a 'judicial sale' within the meaning of the Indiana statute and made absolute the interest of the bankrupt's wife in the real estate.\n\n We see no substantial distinction, so far as the reasoning of the Indiana courts is concerned, between the cases arising under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 and under the present Bankruptcy Act, since under both acts the transfer of title to the bankrupt's property is based, in its last analysis, upon the adjudication in bankruptcy, that is, rests upon the judgment of the bankruptcy court, carried into effect in the one case by a conveyance to the assignee, and in the other by transfer to the trustee by operation of the law.\n In the absence of any conflicting provision in the Bankruptcy Act the question of a wife's interest in the bankrupt's property is governed by the local law. See Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605\n, 38 S. Ct. 215. And, following the construction placed upon the Indiana statute by the courts of that State, we conclude that the adjudication of Erskine as a bankrupt, when followed by the appointment of the trustee in bankruptcy, operated as a 'judicial sale' of his real estate within the meaning of the statute, and made absolute his wife's interest therein.\n Since, however, the application of this statute is expressly limited to $20,000 in value of the husband's real estate, and by the statute of descent the widow's share in real estate exceeding $10,000 and not exceeding $20,000 in value, is one-fourth, it follows that the testamentary trustee was only entitled to receive out of the proceeds of \n\n[271 U.S. 176, 191]\n\u00a0\n the sale, one-fourth of $20,000, that is, $5,000 and not the one-fifth of the entire proceeds which was awarded to him by the District Court.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 30 Stat. 544, c. 541. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 39 Stat. 726, c. 448. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Many of these administrative matters are enumerated at page 207 (32 S. Ct. 620). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It was said in Re Holmes, 142 F. 391, 392, 73 C. C. A. 491, 492, that the question whether the appellate and revisory jurisdiction of the courts of appeals are exclusive of each other 'has resulted in such contrariety of decision relative to the proper method of review of specific orders and such confusion and uncertainty in the practice that it has become necessary for lawyers in many instances to take an appeal and file a petition for revision in the same case in order to be sure to obtain a review of the ruling challenged. ... Moreover, ... a large share of the time and labor of the judges of the courts of appeals, and of the lawyers who assist them, and no insignificant portion of the means of the litigants, all of which are imperatively demanded for the decision of the merits of the questions the parties seek to present, or of still more important issues of law, are consumed in the litigation, determination, and preparation of opinions concerning the question whether an order or proceeding in bankruptcy which is clearly reviewable must be reviewed by appeal or by petition for revision.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Circuit Court of Appeals Misapprehending, it appears, the position taken by the testamentary trustee, and thinking that he did not claim any title under the Judicial Sales Act, did not pass upon this contention. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 14 Stat. 517, c. 176. \n\n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 8563) provides:\n Paragraph 18: '... No carrier by railroad subject to this act shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad ... unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction ... of such ... extended line. ...'\n Paragraph 22: 'The authority of the Commission (so) conferred ... shall not extend to the construction ... of spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks, ... to be located wholly within one state . ...'\n Paragraph 20: 'Any construction ... contrary to the provisions ... of paragraph 18 ... may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of ... any party in interest.'\n This suit was brought by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company1 in the federal District Court for Southern Texas \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n to enjoin the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company from constructing wholly within that state projected trackage, sometimes called the 'Hale- Cement Line.' The bill alleges that the line is, within the meaning of the above provision, an extension of the defendant's railroad; that the prescribed certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission has not been secured; and that operation of the line will result in irreparable injury to the plaintiff, because it will divert to the Santa Fe traffic which would otherwise be enjoyed by the Texas & Pacific. By answer the defendant challenged the jurisdiction of the court, insisted that the line is merely an industrial track, and asserted that the plaintiff is barred by laches. After a full hearing, the District Court entered a final decree enjoining the construction or operation of the line unless and until the prescribed certificate should have been obtained. Lancaster v. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co., 298 F. 488. The case was first brought to this court by the Santa Fe on constitutional grounds, by direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1215). Because no substantial constitutional question was presented, this court transferred it to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Texas & P. R. Co., 46 S. Ct. 128, \n266 U.S. 588\n. There the decree of the District Court was reversed. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Texas & P. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 4 F. (2d) 904. The second appeal to this court was then taken by the Texas & Pacific under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. s 1218), and the case was decketed here on May 5, 1925. The three objections to granting relief which had been set up in the answer were renewed here.\n First. The Santa Fe contends that the decree of the District Court was properly reversed, because the Texas & Pacific had not secured a determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission that the projected line constitutes an extension. It is admitted that, where projected tracks would confessedly constitute an extension and no certificate has been obtained, a court may enjoin construction, although such prior determination by the Commission \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 272]\n\u00a0\n was not made or sought. The claim is that, where the defendant asserts that the proposed tracks do not constitute an extension, the court must, under the doctrine of Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co., 34 S. Ct. 885, \n234 U.S. 138\n, and Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Solum, 38 S. Ct. 550, \n247 U.S. 477\n, 483, either dismiss the bill because it is without jurisdiction, or postpone action because it is without power to proceed, unless and until a determination by the Commission of the controverted question shall have been made. It is argued that the issue whether tracks constitute an extension presents an administrative question; that the Commission has power to decide it, because Congress, by conferring authority to determine whether an extension is compatible with the public interest, has by implication conferred authority to determine also the subordinate question whether a proposed track constitutes an extension; that if the Commission finds the track to be an extension, it may under its general powers make an order requiring the carrier to cease and desist from construction and operation unless and until the prescribed certificate is obtained; and that, as the Commission has such primary jurisdiction, its aid must have been invoked before a court can grant relief.\n To this argument the provisions of the act afford a conclusive answer. Paragraph 18 prohibits construction of an extension without obtaining the certificate. Paragraphs 19 and 20 provide that a carrier desiring to construct one may apply for the certificate and prescribe the method of proceeding. Whenever such an application is made, the Commission may pass incidentally upon the question whether what is called an extension is in fact such;2 for if it proves to be only an industrial track, the Commission must decline, on that ground, to issue a certificate. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[270 U.S. 266, 273]\n\u00a0\n A carrier desiring to construct new tracks does not, by making application to the Commission, necessarily admit that they constitute an extension. It may secure a determination of the question, without waiving any right, by asserting in the application that in its opinion a certificate is not required, because the construction involves only an industrial track. \n4\n But a party in interest, who is opposed to the construction, is not authorized by the act to initiate before the Commission any proceeding concerning the project. If application for a certificate has been made, he may appear there in opposition. If no such application has been made, paragraph 20 affords him the only remedy. That remedy is both affirmative and complete.\n The function of the court upon an application for an injunction under paragraph 20 is a very different one from that exercised by the Commission when, having taken jurisdiction under paragraphs 19 and 20, it grants or refuses a certificate. The function confided in the Commission is comparable to that involved in a determination of the propriety or application of a rate, rule or practice. It is the exercise of administrative judgment. Where the matter is of that character, no justiciable question arises ordinarily until the Commission has acted. Compare Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., 42 S. Ct. 477, \n259 U.S. 285\n, 295. The function of the court upon the application for an injunction is to construe a statutory provision and apply the provision as construed to the facts. The prohibition of paragraph 18 is absolute. If the proposed track is an extension, and no certificate has been obtained, the party in interest opposing construction is entitled as of right to an injunction. The is- \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 274]\n\u00a0\n sue presented to the court by a denial that the proposed trackage is an extension does not differ in its nature from that raised when the denial is directed to the allegation that the defendant is an interstate carrier. Compare Smyth v. Asphalt Belt Ry. Co., 45 S. Ct. 242, \n267 \nU.S. 326, 328\n, 329 S.. If the facts are agreed, the question is one of law. If they are not agreed, the court must find them. In the case at bar, the District Court, having jurisdiction generally of the parties and of the subject-matter, was called upon to determine whether an allegation in the bill, essential to the cause of action, was established. This, the court clearly had power to do. Moreover, even if the question presented were, as contended, property one of jurisdiction, the objection urged could not prevail. Every court of general jurisdiction has power to determine whether the conditions essential to its exercise exist.\n Second. The facts on which the Santa Fe contends that the proposed line is merely an industrial track are undisputed. Dallas is a large interior city. The Texas & Pacific extends through it and beyond in a general westerly direction; the Santa Fe in a general southwesterly direction. Both lines have been operated for many years. Along the Texas & Pacific, commencing at a point 2 1\/2 miles west of the city and extending westward about 2 1\/2 miles further, lies territory known as the 'Industrial District.' To its development the facilities and services furnished by the Texas & Pacific have been essential. In it are cement works, oil refineries, and metal works. The traffic moves in carload lots. All the industries are either located on its right of way or connect with it by spurs. To serve the plants that carrier has long switches and assembling tracks. No other railroad has any direct connection with any of these industries. Their traffic from or destined to the Santa Fe or other lines is interchanged by the Texas & Pacific at points on its line distant from these industries from 12 to 30 miles. Thus the Texas \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 275]\n\u00a0\n & Pacific receives either the whole or a part of the revenue on all the traffic of the district-the richest freight-producing territory in all Texas.\n The Santa Fe has no branch line running near to, or in the direction of, any part of the Industrial District. Hale is a station on its road. The proposed line is to begin at Hale, where storage and assembling yards are to be located, and is to end in the Industrial District, near the Texas & Pacific right of way. The air-line distance from Hale to the proposed terminus is only 3 1\/4 miles; but the length of line is 7 1\/2 miles, besides spurs, sidings, and other subsidiary tracks. The greater length is necessitated in part by topographical conditions. These are such that the cost of construction is estimated at $510,000. There is to be one undercrossing where the new line intersects an interurban line; another where it intersects a highway. There are to be two small trestles and numerous fills and cuts. In some respects the character of the construction is that commonly used for industrial tracks. No intention appeared to ballast the track, save in stretches where the material was bad. Secondhand 75-pound rails, lighter that those commonly used by the Santa Fe , are to be laid. But these are heavier than those used on some of its branches. The ruling grade of the Hale-Cement Line is that prevailing on the Santa Fe branch line running out of Dallas to Paris and Cleburne, with which it is to connect. The right of way averages 100 feet, and it is to be fenced on both sides for its full length.\n No industry is now located along the proposed line between Hale and the Industrial District. The territory adjacent to that part of the line does not now produce any freight tonnage. The Hale-Cement Line was projected by the Santa Fe in order to reach on its own rails the six plants within the district which lie south of the Texas & Pacific Railroad. These furnish 80 per cent. of the traffic of the district. If enabled thus to tap it direct, the Santa \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 276]\n\u00a0\n Fe can secure a part of the strictly competitive business, and can eliminate the division of rates with the Texas & Pacific on all freight of the district received from or destined to the Santa Fe lines, which is now necessarily handled as interline traffic. The freight revenues which the Santa Fe would thus obtain and divert from the Texas & Pacific are estimated at more than $500,000 a year. No plant now served by the Texas & Pacific lies directly on the proposed line. They are so located that the Santa Fe must, in order to reach them, build in each case a spur track to the plant from the Hale-Cement main line, although it describes a curve, due in part to the desire to connect with each of these plants. The Santa Fe must, in order adequately to perform the transportation service, also build near the industries two side tracks, one 1,200 feet the other 1,500 feet, in length.\n The Hale-Cement Line is clearly not a spur in the sense in which that word is commonly used. It presents some of the characteristics of a branch, and a branch is clearly an extension of a railroad, within the meaning of paragraph 18. The Santa Fe contends that it constitutes an industrial track, within the meaning of paragraph 22, because the line is to be constructed solely for industrial purposes. It shows that, according to the plans, the general public is not to be served; that, except at Hale, there will be no public station for the receipt or delivery of freight; no telegraph service; no express, mail, or passenger traffic; that the transportation between Hale and the industries will be confined to carload freight; that it will be conducted as a switching service, for which no charge will be made; and that the Hale rate will apply to all traffic on the projected line. It argues that a branch is a line serving one or more stations beyond the point of junction with the main line or another branch, and to or from which stations regular tariff rates are in effect; that an industrial track is a line constructed to \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 277]\n\u00a0\n serve or reach industries over which regular scheduled passenger or freight train service is not performed, and for transportation over which only a switching charge, if any, is made; and that neither the length of the line, nor the character of the construction, can convert into a branch a line of the nature described.\n In support of its contention that the proposed line constitutes an industrial track, the Santa Fe cites instructions differentiating branches from spurs, which are given by the Interstate Commerce Commission in forms long prescribed for accounting purposes. It points also to uses made of these terms in other connections by courts,5 by the Commission, and by State Legislatures. A truer guide to the meaning of the terms 'extension' and 'industrial track,' as used in paragraphs 18 to 22, is furnished by the context and by the relation of the specific provisions here in question to the railroad policy introduced by Transportation Act of 1920. By that measure, Congress undertook to develop and maintain, for the people of the United States, an adequate railway system. It recognized that preservation of the earning capacity, and conservation of the financial resources, of individual carriers, is a matter of national concern; that the property employed must be permitted to earn a reasonable return; that the building of unnecessary lines involves a waste of resources, and that the burden of this waste may fall upon the public; that competition between carriers may result in harm to the public, as well as in benefit; and that, when a railroad inflicts injury upon its rival, it may be the public which ultimately bears the loss. See Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., 42 S. Ct. 232, \n257 U.S. 563\n, 22 A. L. R. 1086; The New England Divisions Case, 43 S. Ct. 270, \n261 U.S. 184\n; The \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 278]\n\u00a0\n Chicago Junction Case, 44 S. Ct. 317, \n264 U.S. 258\n; Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., 44 S. Ct. 376, \n264 U.S. 331\n. The act sought, among other things, to avert such losses.\n When the clauses in paragraphs 18 to 22 are read in the light of this congressional policy, the meaning and scope of the terms 'extension' and 'industrial track' become clear. The carrier was authorized by Congress to construct, without authority from the Commission, 'spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks ... to be located wholly within one state.' Tracks of that character are commonly constructed, either to improve the facilities required by shippers already served by the carrier or to supply the facilities to others, who being within the same territory and similarly situated are entitled to like service from the carrier. The question whether the construction should be allowed or compelled depends largely upon local conditions, which the state regulating body is peculiarly fitted to appreciate. Moreover, the expenditure involved is ordinarily small. But where the proposed trackage extends into territory not theretofore served by the carrier, and particularly where it extends into territory already served by another carrier, its purpose and effect are, under the new policy of Congress, of national concern. For invasion through new construction of territory adequately served by another carrier, like the establishment of excessively low rates in order to secure traffic enjoyed by another, may be inimical to the national interest. If the purpose and effect of the new trackage is to extend substantially the line of a carrier into new territory, the proposed trackage constitutes an extension of the railroad, within the meaning of paragraph 18, although the line be short, and although the character of the service contemplated be that commonly rendered to industries by means of spurs or industrial tracks. Being an extension, it cannot be built unless the federal Commission issues its certificate that public necessity and convenience require its \n\n[270 U.S. 266, 279]\n\u00a0\n construction. The Hale-Cement Line is clearly an extension within this rule.\n Third. The Santa Fe contends that the judgment denying relief was proper, also, because the Texas & Pacific had been guilty of laches. This defense was not passed upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court overruled it as unsupported in fact, and also on the ground that a plaintiff suing under paragraph 20 represents the public as well as private interests, and that hence a plaintiff's laches cannot operate as a bar. We need not determine whether the latter ground is sound, for the facts do not warrant a finding of laches. The Santa Fe gave no publicity to its purpose. It had purchased some of the right of way before the Texas & Pacific learned that the line was planned. The latter protested immediately to both the state and the federal Commissions, and insisted that the proposed line constituted an extension. The Santa Fe , having been advised by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the Texas & Pacific protest, had some correspondence with the Director of Finance. We need not discuss its import. The Santa Fe did not file an application for a certificate of public necessity and convenience. It continued its purchase of the right of way despite the Texas & Pacific protests. It made the contract for construction of the line after the commencement of the suit. It proceeded with the construction until stopped by the injunction. It acted at its peril.\n In its appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals the Santa Fe assigned as error that the decree entered was too broad or was indefinite. If the objection is well founded, the error may be cured by application to the District Court.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents, on the ground that the question should have been first submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The suit was begun by Lancaster and Wallace, receivers of the corporation.

Ct. 354. The judgment is one of conviction of the petitioners under an indictment found in the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, charging the petitioners and 16 others with the crime of conspiracy under section 37 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201) to commit the offense against the United States denounced in section 62 of the same Code (Comp. St.  10230). Section 62 punishes any one who shall assault or interfere with an employee of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Agricultural Department in the execution of his \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n duties or on account of his execution of them, and who shall use a deadly weapon in resisting any such employee in such execution. The indictment was demurred to, and the demurrer was overruled. The defendants were tried and found guilty. On writ of error the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 2 F.(2d) 561.\n The first count of the indictment charged that the defendants conspired to deter and prevent certain employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry from discharging their duties in supervising the dipping of, and causing to be dipped, cattle in order to prevent the spread of splenetic fever among them, and to eradicate the cattle fever tick, and that for this purpose the defendants used deadly weapons and killed one such employee and wounded others, all in the county of Echols, Ga. The second count charged that the conspiracy was directed, not only to the use of force against the employees themselves, but also to the dynamiting of spray pens and dipping vats used by such employees in their duties in causing the dipping of the cattle and the supervision thereof.\n Under the Act of May 29, 1884, 23 Stat. 31, c. 60, a Bureau of Animal Industry was organized in the Department of Agriculture. It is made th duty of the bureau by section 1 (Comp. St.  850), to investigate and report upon the condition of the domestic animals, their protection and use, to inquire into and report the causes of contagious, infectious and communicable diseases among them and to collect information on the subject. By section 2 (Comp. St.  8690) it is authorized to employ experts. By section 3 (Comp. St.  8691), it is made the duty of the Commissioner of Agriculture to prepare such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the supervision and effective suppression and extirpation of such diseases, and to certify such rules and regulations to the executive authorities of each state and territory, and invite them to co-operate in the execution and enforcement of the act. Whenever the plans and methods are accepted by any \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 419]\n\u00a0\n state or territory, in which such diseases are declared to exist, and the state or territory has adopted plans and methods for the suppression and extirpation of the diseases, and those plans shall be accepted by the Commissioner of Agriculture, and whenever a Governor or other properly constituted authority of a state signifies his readiness to co-operate for the extinction of such disease in conformity with the act, the Commissioner is authorized to expend so much of the money appropriated as may be necessary in such investigation and in such disinfection and quarantine measures as may be necessary to prevent the spread of the disease from one territory or state into another.\n By an Act of February 9, 1889, 25 Stat. 659, c. 122 (Comp. St.  789 et seq.), the Department of Agriculture was made an executive department of the government under a Secretary of Agriculture, who was vested with all the authority conferred by the Act of May 29, 1884, supra, on the Commissioner of Agriculture. By Act of February 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 791, c. 349 (Comp. St.  8698-8700), the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized and directed from time to time to make regulations concerning the exportation and transportation of live stock from any place within the United States where he had reason to believe a contagious cattle disease existed into and through any other state or territory as he might deem necessary and all such rules and regulations were to have the force of law. Whenever any inspector or assistant inspector of the Bureau of Animal Industry issued a certificate showing that the officer had inspected any cattle or other live stock to be transported from one locality to another and had found them free from Texas or splenetic fever infection or other disease, it was provided that the cattle might be shipped, driven or transported from one state or territory to another without further inspection, but that such animals should at all times be under the control and supervision of the bureau for the purposes of \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 420]\n\u00a0\n such inspection, and that the Secretary might make regulations to prevent the introduction or dissemination of contagion from one state to another.\n By Act of March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1264, c. 1496 (Comp. St.  8701 et seq.), the Secretary is authorized and directed to quarantine any state or territory, or any portion of any state or territory when he shall determine the fact that cattle or other live stock therein are affected with any communicable disease. Section 2 of that act (Comp. St.  8702) prohibits the transportation, delivery for transportation, or driving on foot from any quarantined state or territory into any other state or territory, cattle or live stock except as provided in the act. Sections 3 and 4 (Comp. St.  8703, 8704) give the Secretary authority to make rules and regulations for the inspection, disinfection, certification, treatment, handling and method and manner of delivery and shipment of cattle or other live stock from a quarantined state into any other state when the public safety will permit, but prohibits such movement in manner or method or under conditions other than those prescribed by the Secretary.\n Under date of June 15, 1916, various regulations were issued by the Secretary of Agriculture. They are not printed in the record, but they are matters of which we may take judicial notice. Caha v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 211\n, 14 S. Ct. 513. Under the regulations when the Secretary determines that cattle in any state or territory are affected with a contagious disease, and he thinks a quarantine should be established, a rule is to be issued giving notice of the fact, to forbid the interstate movement of live stock from the quarantined area to be prescribed. Regulation 2 provides that cattle of the quarantined area exposed to or infected with ticks which have been properly dipped twice with a certain solution and in the proper way under the supervision of an inspector of the Bureau, may be moved interstate for any purpose when the inspector certifies them to be free of infection from \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 421]\n\u00a0\n splenetic fever: Provided that the conditions are such that the cattle may be moved to the free area without exposure to infection. The cattle are to be accompanied by a statement of dipping by the inspector supervising the same at the point of origin, and showing the ownership of the cattle, etc., and that cattle located in areas where tick eradication is being conducted in co-operation with the state authorities, and which are on premises known by the Bureau of Inspection to be free from ticks, may upon inspection and certification at a suitable season by a bureau inspector be moved interstate for any purpose without dipping. One rule issued by the Secretary of Agriculture shows a description of the areas quarantined, which included Echols county, Ga.\n The evidence for the government at the trial showed that Echols county, where this conspiracy was formed and the overt acts took place, was on the line between Georgia and Florida; that cattle ranged between one state and the other in that region; that the Department of Agriculture had quarantined in interstate transportation the cattle coming from Echols county because of the presence of the cattle tick among them; that under the act an agreement had been made between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Georgia authorities acting under a Georgia statute, by which the regulations of the Secretary had been accepted as guidance for the state employees engaged in attempting to suppress the disease by requiring tick- infested cattle to be dipped; that spray pens and dipping vats had been erected in Echols county at the expense of the United States, to carry out the duties of the Bureau of Animal Industry; that the state law authorized and directed the county and state to enforce the dipping of cattle in the county which were tick-infested by process served in the name of the state, and that the state officers served such processes upon cattle owners in the county; that the cattle which were \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 422]\n\u00a0\n thoroughly dipped were marked with indelible paint; that United States inspectors were not always present at the dipping but usually supervised what was done to gain a knowledge of what the state officers were doing in enforcing the state law, so that, if successful, the quarantine against cattle for shipment out of Georgia against Echols county could be discontinued; that this was only one instance of the investigations required under the Act of 1884 by the Bureau of Animal Industry employees to help cattle movements from the Southern states to the North in promotion of interstate commerce; that it was while these activities of the employees of the Federal Bureau were progressing that the defendants and others, residents of Echols county, owners of cattle, and neighbors, resenting the necessity for dipping, dynamited the spray pens and the dipping vats and assaulted the United States employees of the bureau, wounded several and killed one by gun shot.\n The first objection to the conviction is based on the indictment in that it contains no allegation that the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture for the suppression and extirpation of the disease among live stock have been certified to the executive authority of the state of Georgia and accepted. The legality and validity of the action of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Bureau of Animal Industry in preventing the spread of disease from one state to another do not depend upon the consent of the state authorities. In the broad provisions of the legislation we have quoted, the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to direct the employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry to engage in quarantine measures and the inspection of animals suspected of or known to have communicable diseases is not limited to cases in which there is co- operation between the United States and the state authorities in the suppression of the spread of disease among cattle, the one as between states and the other as \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 423]\n\u00a0\n within a state. In order to make the action of both more effective, they may co-operate so that their respective purposes may be more effectively carried out, but the power of each to act in its field does not depend upon the consent of the other. Therefore it is that such an averment as that suggested by the defendants' objection would be superfluous for the indictment of the federal crime, although it would be quite relevant in evidence as one of the circumstances to explain what happened.\n It is next objected that there were no allegations in the indictment that the cattle being dipped were the subject-matter of interstate commerce or had in any way under the law become subject to the supervision or control of the Secretary of Agriculture, or that what the employees were doing was to prevent the spread of communicable disease among the cattle from one state to another. The charge is of a conspiracy to commit the offense of an assault upon employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry, to prevent the execution of their duties as such and does not charge the substantive offense itself. The rules of criminal pleading do not require the same degree of detail in an indictment for conspiracy, in stating the object of the conspiracy, as if it were one charging the substantive offense. Williamson v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 425, 447\n, 28 S. Ct. 163; Wolf v. United States (C. C. A.) 283 F. 885; Foster v. United States 256 F. 207, 167 C. C. A. 423. Compare Ledbetter v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 606, 612\n, 18 S. Ct. 774; Connors v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 408, 411\n, 15 S. Ct. 951; Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 84\n, 28 S. Ct. 428.\n The assaults upon the employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry and the interference with their duties were described in the indictment as having to do with the inspection of suspected cattle and the supervision of their dipping. As their duties in connection with suspected and diseased cattle were described in the statute as imposed for the purpose of preventing the spread of con- \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 424]\n\u00a0\n tagious cattle disease from one state to another it is sufficient certainty to a common intent to describe generally that they were performing their duties under the statute in the supervision and dipping of cattle, without further definition.\n It is finally urged against this conviction that the statute of 1884, supra, is unconstitutional, in that Congress had no power to make it a duty of a federal employee to dip cattle and suppress disease among cattle within a state; that such power is vested in the Legislature of the state under the reservations of the Tenth Amendment to the federal Constitution; and that such legislation by Congress cannot be sustained as a regulation of interstate commerce, because it is not confined to interstate commerce, and the cattle treated were not in interstate commerce.\n It is very evident, from the act of 1884 and the subsequent legislation and the regulations issued under them, that everything authorized to be done was expressly intended to prevent the spread of disease from one state to another by contagion, which, of course, means by the passage of diseased cattle from one state to another. This is interstate commerce. The quarantine provided for was to stop and regulate such interstate commerce until it could be safely carried on. Not until suitable inspection by the federal authorities and treatment prescribed for dipping of the cattle could the cattle be certainly rid of the ticks and splenetic fever, and prevented from being a dangerous source of contagion in the state into which they were going. The duties of the employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry here interfered with were all part of the measure of quarantine reasonably adapted to prevent the spread of contagion in and by interstate commerce.\n The requirement of dipping was a reasonable condition of allowing cattle from a suspected district to pass \n\n[271 U.S. 414, 425]\n\u00a0\n into another state, and the provision of dipping vats and other means of complying with this requirement in a border county by the United States, and the supervision of such dipping by federal employees, and indeed the dipping itself by them, were conveniences promoting interstate commerce where quarantine was necessary. There is no evidence that federal employees took part in enforcing dipping of all cattle of the county. That was done by state officers under the state law.\n But it is said that these cattle do not appear to have been intended to be transported by rail or boat from one state to another, and this only is interstate commerce in cattle under the Constitution. They were on the line between the two states. To drive them across the line would be interstate commerce, and the act of 1905 expressly prohibits driving them on foot when carrying contagion. It is argued, however, that when the cattle only range across the line between the states, and are not transported or driven, their passage is not interstate commerce. We do not think that such passage by ranging can be differentiated from interstate commerce. It is intercourse between states, made possible by the failure of owners to restrict their ranging, and is due, therefore, to the will of their owners.\n More than this, it is established by United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S. Ct. 445, that the authority of Congress over interstate commerce extends to dealing with and preventing burdens to that commerce and the spread of disease from one state to another by such cattle ranging would clearly be such a burden, if it were not to be regarded as commerce itself and is therefore properly within the congressional inhibition.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 196\nArgued: January 29, 1926Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Raymond M. Hudson, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States. \n\n[270 U.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal was taken from a judgment of the Court of Claims ( Judicial Code, s 242 (Comp. St. s 1219), before its repeal by Act Feb. 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 941)), dismissing appellant's petition and adjudging that the United States was entitled to recover on a counterclaim set up in its answer in that court.\n The appellant entered into a contract with the government, dated June 24, 1918, to supply it with a quantity of cloth at a specified price. It was provided by the contract that the government might, in the event of the termination of the war, cancel the contract with respect to cloth not delivered. The contract contained a clause for ascertaining the balance due and payable to the appellant in case of cancellation. By a second contract of July 6, 1918, the government undertook to advance money to appellant for the purchase of machinery, equipment, and raw material required for the performance of its original contract. Appellant gave its demand note for the principal sum advanced, with interest at 6 per cent., and it was provided by the contract that specified deductions from payments, as they became due from the government for the cloth delivered, should be credited on the note.\n On November 15, 1918, the government canceled the original contract after 19.02 per cent. of the deliveries stipulated for had been made. Appellant presented a claim to the War Department for the amount due under this contract, and after proceedings had before the Purchase Claims Board, and an appeal to the Board of Contract Adjustment, an award was made to appellant, by authority of the Secretary of War, in the sum of $14,054.59, which was stated by its terms to be 'in full adjustment, payment, and discharge of said agreement' of June 24, 1918\n\n\n On June 3, 1920, appellant accepted the award by a formal statement to that effect, written at the end of it and signed by the appellant, by its treasurer. \n\n[270 U.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n The cause of action stated by appellant is upon its first contract of June 24, 1918, and, as the Court of Claims found, all of the items set up by appellant in this suit were embodied in its claim to the War Department on which the award was made. The government pleaded, by way of counterclaim, the balance due upon the appellant's promissory note, less the amount of the award, and judgment was given against the appellant for this amount, with accrued interest.\n Appellant, notwithstanding such cases as United States v. Adams, 7 Wall. 463; Savage, Executrix, v. United States, \n92 U.S. 382\n, 388; United States v. Child & Co., 12 Wall. 232, 243; United States v. Justice, 14 Wall. 535; Mason v. United States, 17 Wall. 67, seeks to avoid the effect of the accepted award by setting up that the Secretary of War was without authority to make it and, upon various technical grounds, that appellant's acceptance was not binding.\n It is unnecessary for us to consider these contentions; for there are no findings by the Court of Claims that appellant suffered any loss or damage by reason of the cancellation of the contract, and in fact no findings which would support a judgment in its favor on any theory.\n The appellant also objects that, if the award is valid, it is a bar to the government's counterclaim. But an examination of the award, which is set out in detail in the findings, shows that the award was concerned only with the first contract of June 24, 1918, and that the items and computations which entered into it related only to that contract. The amount due from the government upon appellant's note and second contract was unaffected by it.\n There is no merit in the objection that the amount of the award should have been credited on appellant's note as of the date of the cancellation of the first contract, thus reducing the amount of interest payable on the note. If the award was valid, it was properly credited as of its \n\n[270 U.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n date. If it was invalid, appellant, as already pointed out, has laid no foundation for any offset to the amount due on the note.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRUSLER v.

If, as he insists, that section is beyond congressional power and therefore invalid, he must prevail; otherwise, the judgment below must be affirmed.\n That statute is entitled:\n'An act taxing contracts for the sale of grain for future delivery, and options for such contracts, and providing for the regulation of boards of trade, and for other purposes.'\n\n Section 2 declares that the term \"contract of sale' shall be held to include sales, agreements of sale, and agreements to sell'; the word \" grain' shall ... mean wheat, corn, oats, barley, rye, flax, and sorghum'; the words \"board of trade' shall be held to include and mean any exchange or association, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of persons who shall be engaged in the business of buying or selling grain or receiving the same for sale on consignment.'\n Section 3:\n'That in addition to the taxes now imposed by law there is hereby levied a tax amounting to 20 cents per bushel on each bushel involved therein, whether the actual commodity is intended to be delivered or only nominally referred to, upon each and every privilege or \n\n[269 U.S. 475, 480]\n\u00a0\n option for a contract either of purchase or sale of grain, intending hereby to tax only the transactions known to the trade as 'privileges,' 'bids,' 'offers,' 'puts and calls,' 'indemnities,' or 'ups and downs.\"\n\n Sections 4 to 10 impose a charge of 20 cents per bushel upon all grain involved in sale contracts for future delivery, with two exceptions. But, as declared by Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 66\n, 42 S. Ct. 453, 457 ( 66 L. Ed. 822) their real purpose was to regulate 'the conduct of business of boards of trade through supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture and the use of an administrative tribunal consisting of that Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General.'\n Section 11:\n'That if any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the act and of the application of such provision to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.'\n\n Sections 4 to 10 were challenged in Hill v. Wallace, decided upon demurrer to the bill, and we held:\n'The act is in essence and on its face a complete regulation of Boards of Trade, with a penalty of 20 cents a bushel on all 'futures' to coerce Boards of Trade and their members into compliance. When this purpose is declared in the title to the bill, and is so clear from the effect of the provisions of the bill itself, it leaves no ground upon which the provisions we have been considering can be sustained as a valid exercise of the taxing power.'\n\n We there said:\n'There are sections of the act to which under section 11 the reasons for our conclusion as to section 4 and the interwoven regulations do not apply. ... Section 3, too, would not seem to be affected by our conclusion. ... This is the imposition of an excise tax upon certain transactions of a unilateral character in grain markets which approximate gambling or offer full opportunity for it and does not seem to be associated with section 4. Such a tax without more would seem to be within the \n\n[269 U.S. 475, 481]\n\u00a0\n congressional power. ... But these are questions which are not before us and upon which we wish to express no definite opinion.'\n\n Of course, the quoted statement concerning section 3 was intended to preclude any posible inference that he had passed upon a matter not directly in issue and to indicate that it remained open for discussion.\n The present cause was tried upon a agreed statement of facts and it appears-\n That at Emporia, Kan., October 23, 1923, plaintiff in error, a member of the Chicago Board of Trade, in consideration of one dollar, signed and delivered the following privilege or option, in the form commonly known as an 'indemnity,' addressed to R. F. Teichgraeber, for a contract for the sale of grain:\n'I will sell one thousand bushels of contract grade wheat at $1.11 1\/4 per bushel, for delivery during May, 1924, same to be delivered in regular warehouses under the rules of the Board of Trade of the city of Chicago. This offer is made subject to acceptance by you until the closing hour for regular trading on October 24, 1923.'\n\n The transaction was one of those described by section 3 as 'privileges, bids, offers, puts and calls, indemnities, or ups and downs.'\n After duly advising the collector that he denied validity of the tax plaintiff in error affixed to this written instrument $200 of internal revenue stamps.\n For many years prior to August 24, 1921, members of grain exchanges bought and sold in large quantities agreements for contracts for purchase or sale of grain subject to acceptance within a definite time thereafter, commonly known as 'indemnities.' When the holder of one of these elected to exercise his rights the specified amount of grain was bought or sold on the exchange indicated for future delivery, and the agreement was thus finally consummated.\n By far the larger percentage of such agreements were subject to acceptance during the following day at a price \n\n[269 U.S. 475, 482]\n\u00a0\n ordinarily within one-fourth to three-fourths of a cent of the price prevailing when the market closed on day of the agreement. During many years the uniform consideration paid was one dollar per thousand bushels.\n When the holder elected to exercise the option the transaction could be carried out only through and by members of exchanges open to sales for future delivery.\n The stipulated facts reveal the cost, terms and use of 'indemnity' contracts together with their relation to boards of trade and indicate quite plainly that section 3 was not intended to produce revenue but to prohibit all such contracts as part of the prescribed regulatory plan. The major part of this plan was condemned in Hill v. Wallace, and section 3, being a mere feature, without separate purpose, must share the invalidity of the whole. Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n267 \nU.S. 552, 569\n, 45 S. Ct. 441.\n This conclusion seems inevitable when consideration is given to the title of the act, the price usually paid for such options, the size of the prescribed tax (20 cents per bushel), the practical inhibition of all transactions within the terms of section 3, the consequent impossibility of raising any revenue thereby, and the intimate relation of that section to the unlawful scheme for regulation under guise of taxation. The imposition is a penalty, and in no proper sense a tax. Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S. Ct. 449; Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557, 561\n, 42 S. Ct. 549; Linder v.

That sum was collected by the carrier, in accordance with a demurrage tariff duly filed, as a so-called penalty at the rate of $10 a day for the detention of a car containing lumber shipped interstate over the defendant's railroad to the plaintiff at Aberdeen, S. D., and there held at its request for reconsignment. The claim that the charge was illegally exacted rests upon the contentions that imposition of a penalty exceeds the statutory authority conferred upon the Commission; that if the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.), be construed as conferring such authority, the provision is void, because Congress is without power to authorize the Commission to impose it, since prescribing a penalty is a legislative function which cannot be delegated; and that, even if authority to impose a penalty was validly conferred, this particular provision is void, because, by imposing the penalty without notice, there is a denial of due process of law; and that, being imposed only on shippers of lumber, there is a denial of equal protection of the laws.\n The tariff in question provides:\n'To prevent undue detention of equipment under present emergency, the following additional penalties for detention of equipment will apply:\n\n'On cars loaded with lumber held for reconsignment a storage charge of $10 per car will be assessed for each day or fractional part of a day that a car is held for reconsignment after 48 hours after the hour at which free time begins to run under the demurrage rules.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 259, 261]\n\u00a0\n 'These charges will be assessed regardless of whether cars are held on railroad hold tracks or transfer tracts, including consignee's or other private sidings, and will be in addition to any existing demurrage and storage charges.'\n The general nature of charges under the Uniform Demurrage Code was considered in Swift & Co. v.

The nature and scope of the reconsignment privilege are stated in Reconsignment Case, 47 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 590; Reconsignment Case No. 3, 53 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 455; Stetson, Cutler & Co. v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co., 91 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 3. This penalty charge was attacked as unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory in American Wholesale Lumber Association v. Director General, 66 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 393, and there held by the Interstate Commerce Commission to be neither unreasonable nor otherwise unlawful. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n By stipulation in writing a jury was waived, the case was submitted on agreed facts, these were adopted by the court as a special finding of facts, and judgment was entered for the defendant on November 8, 1924, 2 F . (2d) 291. The District Court had jurisdiction under paragraph 8 of section 24 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), despite the small amount, because the suit arises under a law regulating commerce. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. \n\n[271 U.S. 259, 262]\n\u00a0\n Rice, \n247 \nU.S. 201\n, 38 S. Ct. 429. Preliminary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission was unnecessary, because no administrative question is presented. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, 42 S. Ct. 477. The case is here on direct writ of error under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1915), prior to its recent amendment, because of the constitutional questions involved.\n The efficient use of freight cars is an essential of an adequate transportation system. To secure it, broad powers are conferred upon the Commission. Compare United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533\n, 44 S. Ct. 610; Avent v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 127\n, 45 S. Ct. 34; United States v. P. Koenig Coal Co. (No. 216, April 12, 1926), \n270 \nU.S. 512\n, 46 S. Ct. 392. One cause of undue detention is lack of promptness in loading at the point of origin, or in unloading at the point of destination. Another cause is diversion of the car from its primary use as an instrument of transportation by employing it as a place of storage, either at destination or at reconsignment points, for a long period while seeking a market for the goods stored therein. To permit a shipper so to use freight cars is obviously beyond the ordinary duties of a carrier. The right to assess charges for undue detention existed at common law. Now, they are subject, like other freight charges, to regulation by the Commission. Demurrage charges are thus published as a part of the tariffs filed pursuant to the statutes.\n All demurrage charges have a double purpose. One is to secure compensation for the use of the car and of the track which it occupies. The other is to promote car efficiency by providing a deterrent against undue detention. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Kittanning Iron & Steel Co., \n253 \nU.S. 319, 323\n, 40 S. Ct. 532; Edward Hines, etc., Trustees, v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 145\n, 44 S. Ct. 72. The charge here in question, although called a penalty, is in essence an additional demurrage charge, increasing at a step rate. Such additional charges increasing with the length of the pe- \n\n[271 U.S. 259, 263]\n\u00a0\n riod of detention were introduced in respect to some cars by the National Car Demurrage Rules. See Rule 7, Demurrage Charges, sections A and B. They were widely applied while the railroads were under federal control. See General Orders of the Director General, Nos. 37, 7 and 7a; Bulletin No. 4, Revised (1919) pp. 146, 151; Supplement to Bulletin, Revised (1920) p. 44. The power to impose such charges, if reasonable, is clear. Those here in question have been found by the Commission to be reasonable. It is not claimed that there was no evidence to support the finding. Compare Louisiana & Pine Bluff Ry. Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 114\n, 42 S. Ct. 25.\n The further contentions are that there was a denial of due process of law because the so-called penalty was imposed without notice; and that there was a denial of equal protection of the laws, because the charge was applicable only to cars loaded with lumber. The demurrage charge is, however, a tariff provision and not a penal law, and thus, the tariff duly filed charges the shipper with the requisite notice. And neither the Constitution nor the rule of reason requires that either freight or demurrage charges or the reconsignment privilege shall be the same for all commodities. We find no reason to disturb the basis of the Commission's classification.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] During the period of federal control this tariff was filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, as provided by law, to be effective October 20, 1919. After the termination of federal control the defendant and other railroads continued to maintain the provision in their published tariffs until March 13, 1922, when it was canceled in pursuance of the decision and order of the Commission in American Wholesale Lumber Co. v. Director General, 66 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 393. \n\n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTUTUN v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 762\nArgued: March 3, 1926Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n Messrs. Louis Marshall, of New York City, William H. Lewis, of Boston, Mass., and Matthew M. Levy and Eugene Untermyer, both of New York City, for Tutun and Neuberger.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present, by certificate, the question whether the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to review a decree or order of a federal District Court denying the petition of an alien to be admitted to citizenship in the United States.\n The existence of the jurisdiction was assumed by this court, without discussion, in Ozawa v. United States, 43 S. Ct. 65, \n260 U.S. 178\n. It has been exercised by the Circuit Courts of Appeals in most of the circuits. \n1\n In the Fifth circuit \n\n[270 U.S. 568, 575]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction was denied in United States v. Dolla, 177 F. 101, 100 C. C. A. 521, 21 Ann. Cas. 665. Although the correctness of the decision was questioned by Judge Amidon in United States v. Leonore (D. C.) 207 F. 865, 869, and by Judge Hough in United States v. Mulvey (C. C. A.) 232 F. 513, 521, 522, it has been followed in the Third circuit and in the Eighth. \n2\n In the state courts judgments granting or denying petitions for naturalization have generally been held to be reviewable on appeal, like other cases. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The 'jurisdiction to naturalize aliens as citizens of the United States' is conferred by Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, s 3, 34 Stat. 596 ( Comp. St. s 4351) upon the District Courts, among others. Jurisdiction to review the 'final decision in the \n\n[270 U.S. 568, 576]\n\u00a0\n District Courts ... in all cases,' except as otherwise provided, was conferred by Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, s 6, 26 Stat. 826, 828, upon Circuit Courts of Appeals. This provisions was re-enacted in Judicial Code, s 128, and by Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, in section 128(a) (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 1120). The order granting or denying a petition for naturalization is clearly a final decision within the meaning of that section. Ex parte Tiffany, 40 S. Ct. 239, \n252 U.S. 32\n. This is true, although a certificate granted may be canceled under section 15 of the Naturalization Act (Comp. St. s 4374). United States v. Ness, 38 S. Ct. 118, \n245 U.S. 319\n. And a denial of the petition may not preclude another application for naturalization. In re Pollock (D. C.) 257 F. 350. Compare Salinger v. Loisel, 44 S. Ct. 519, \n265 U.S. 224\n, 230. The substantial question is whether a petition for naturalization is a case within the meaning of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act.\n The function of admitting to citizenship has been conferred exclusively upon courts continuously since the foundation of our government. See Act of March 26, 1790, c. 3, 1 Stat. 103. The federal District Courts, among others, have performed that function since the Act of January 29, 1795, c. 20, 1 Stat. 414. The constitutionality of this exercise of jurisdiction has never been questioned. If the proceeding were not a case or controversy within the meaning of article 3, s 2, this delegation of power upon the courts would have been invalid. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409; United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40; Muskrat v. United States, 31 S. Ct. 250, \n219 U.S. 346\n. Whether a proceeding which results in a grant is a judicial one does not depend upon the nature of the thing granted, but upon the nature of the proceeding which Congress has provided for securing the grant. The United States may create rights in individuals against itself and provide only an administrative remedy. United States v. Babcock, 39 S. Ct. 464, \n250 U.S. 328\n, 331. It may provide a legal remedy, but make resort to the courts available \n\n[270 U.S. 568, 577]\n\u00a0\n only after all administrative remedies have been exhausted. Compare New Orleans v. Paine, 13 S. Ct. 303, \n147 U.S. 261\n; United States v. Sing Tuck, 24 S. Ct. 621, \n194 U.S. 161\n; American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 43 S. Ct. 541, \n262 U.S. 209\n. It may give to the individual the option of either an administrative or a legal remedy. Compare Clyde v. United States, 13 Wall. 38; Chorpenning v. United States, \n94 U.S. 397\n, 399. Or it may provide only a remedy. Compare Turner v. United States, 39 S. Ct. 109, \n248 U.S. 354\n. Whenever the law provides a remedy enforceable in the courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and that remedy is pursued, there arises a case within the meaning of the Constitution, whether the subject of the litigation be property or status. A petition for naturalization is clearly a proceeding of that character.\n The petitioner's claim is one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The claim is presented to the court in such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon it. The proceeding is instituted and is conducted throughout according to the regular course of judicial procedure. The United States is always a possible adverse party. By section 11 of the Naturalization Act (Comp. St. s 4370) the full rights of a litigant are expressly reserved to it. See In re Mudarri (C. C.) 176 F. 465. Its contentions are submitted to the court for adjudication. See Smith v. Adams, 9 S. Ct. 566, \n130 \nU.S. 167, 173\n, 174 S.. Section 9 (Comp. St. s 4368) provides that every final hearing must be held in open court, that upon such hearing the applicant and witnesses shall be examined under oath before the court and in its presence, and that every final order must be made under the hand of the court and shall be entered in full upon the record. The judgment entered, like other judgments of a court of record, is accepted as complete evidence of its own validity unless set aside. Campbell v. Gordon, 6 Cranch, 176; Spratt v. Spratt, 4 Pet. 393, 408. It may not be collaterally attacked. Pintsch Compressing Co. \n\n[270 U.S. 568, 578]\n\u00a0\n v. Bergin (C. C.) 84 F. 140. If a certificate is procured when the prescribed qualifications have no existence in fact, it may be canceled by suit. 'It is in this respect,' as stated in Johannessen v. United States, 32 S. Ct. 613, 615, \n225 U.S. 227\n, 238 (56 L. Ed. 1066) 'closely analogous to a public grant of land (Rev. Stat. s 2289 et seq. (Comp. St. s 4530)), or of the exclusive right to make, use and vend a new and useful invention ( Rev. Stat. s 4883, et. seq. (Comp. St. s 9427)).'\n The opportunity to become a citizen of the United States is said to be merely a privilege, and not a right. It is true that the Constitution does not confer upon aliens the right to naturalization. But it authorizes Congress to establish a uniform rule therefor. Article 1, s 8, cl. 4. The opportunity having been conferred by the Naturalization Act, there is a statutory right in the alien to submit his petition and evidence to a court, to have that tribunal pass upon them, and, if the requisite facts are established, to receive the certificate. See United States v. Shanahan ( D. C.) 232 F. 169, 171. There is, of course, no 'right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are complied with.' United States v. Ginsberg, 37 S. Ct. 422, \n243 U.S. 472\n, 475 (61 L. Ed. 853); Luria v. United States, 34 S. Ct. 10, \n231 U.S. 9\n, 22 58 L. Ed. 101. The applicant for citizenship, like other suitors who institute proceedings in a court of justice to secure the determination of an asserted right, must allege in his petition the fulfillment of all conditions upon the existence of which the alleged right is made dependent, and he must establish these allegations by competent evidence to the satisfaction of the court. In re Bodek (C. C.) 63 F. 813, 814, 815; In re _____, 7 Hill (N. Y.) 137. In passing upon the application the court exercises judicial judgment. It does not confer or withhold a favor.\n The government contends that, at all events, a naturalization proceeding is not a case within the meaning of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act. The same phrase may, of course, have different meanings when used in different \n\n[270 U.S. 568, 579]\n\u00a0\n connections. Lamar v. United States, 36 S. Ct. 255, \n240 U.S. 60\n, 65. The Constitution does not require that a litigant be afforded the opportunity of having every judicial decision reviewed by an appellate court. Compare Rogers v. Peck, 26 S. Ct. 87, \n199 U.S. 425\n, 435. But the Circuit Court of Appeals Act conferred upon that court appellate jurisdiction of final decisions of the district courts 'in all cases' except those for which it provided a direct review by this Court. See Lau Ow Bew v. United States, 12 S. Ct. 517, \n144 U.S. 47\n, 57; The Paquete Habana, 20 S. Ct. 290, \n175 U.S. 677\n, 683-686. A denial of a review in naturalization cases would ingraft an exception upon an otherwise universal rule. Compare Craig v. Hecht, 44 S. Ct. 103, \n263 U.S. 255\n, 274-276; In re Graves (C. C. A.) 270 F. 181. There is nothing in that act which should limit the application of the all-embracing language used.\n It is argued that the Naturalization Act denies appellate jurisdiction, since section 3 declares that 'exclusive jurisdiction to naturalize aliens as citizens' is conferred upon the federal and state courts there specified, and these do not include the Circuit Courts of Appeals. The term 'exclusive' was used in section 3 in order to withdraw the jurisdiction which minor state courts, being courts of record, had exercised under the authority conferred by earlier naturalization statutes. See House Doc. No. 46, 59th Cong. 1st Sess. Ser. No. 4984, pp. 18-24. The section makes no reference to appellate proceedings. It is also argued that Congress manifested the intention of denying the usual method of appellate review by providing in section 15 for a bill in equity to cancel certificates of citizenship. The remedy afforded to the government by section 15 is narrower in scope than the review commonly afforded by appellate courts. Moreover, there is no corresponding provision which would afford to the applicant for citizenship an independent remedy for correcting errors committed in the district court.\n Since the adoption of the Constitution Congress has by its legislation sought to promote the naturalization of \n\n[270 U.S. 568, 580]\n\u00a0\n qualified resident aliens. The act of 1906 did not introduce any change in policy. It did change, in some respects, the qualifications; and to carry out the established policy through more effective application of the law, it made changes in administrative and judicial machinery. That end is subserved by the correction of errors of the trial court through appellate review. Neither United States v. Ness, 38 S. Ct. 118, \n245 U.S. 319\n, 326, nor the history of the legislation there referred to, leads to a denial of appellate review. In that case attention was called to the fact that Congress had not provided in the act of 1906 for an appeal from judgments of the state courts admitting aliens to citizenship. The question under discussion was whether a judgment of naturalization entered by a state court barred as res judicata a proceeding brought in a federal court under section 15 to cancel the certificate of naturalization.\n To the questions asked in the two cases, we answer that the Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review by appeal the order or decree of the District Court denying the petition to be admitted to citizenship in the United States. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the following cases appellate courts entertained jurisdiction over petitions for naturalization without expressly considering the existence of a right of appeal: First Circuit: Harmon v.

ST LOUIS, S F & T R CO(1926)\nNo. 91\nArgued: November 16, 1925Decided: January 18, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, Ill., for the United states.\n Mr. Lawrence H. Cake, of Washington, D. C., for appellee St. Louis, S. F. & T. Ry. Co.\n Mr. F. Carter Pope, of Washington, D. C. for appellee Wabash Ry. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, which were argued together, present on similar facts the same question of law. In each the railroad had, prior to federal control, rendered to the War Department transportation service, payment for which was disallowed by the Auditor. Each company commenced suit therefor in the Court of Claims more than three years, but within six years from the time when the cause of action accrued, and after the lapse of three years from the enactment of Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, c. 10071 1\/4 et seq.). That act, amending paragraph 3 of section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act, provides:\n'All actions at law by carriers subject to this act for recovery of their charges, or any part thereof, shall be begun within three years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after.' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 8584\n\n\n\n The government defended these suits solely on the ground that the right to sue had been lost by lapse of time. It contended that the three- year limitation ap- \n\n[270 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n plies to claims against the government prosecuted in the Court of Claims, as well as to actions brought against other shippers in other courts; that it applies to claims which arose prior to the passage of the 1920 act; that the three-year period began at the date when the cause of action accrued, provided there remained, at the passage of the act, a reasonable time before the expiration of the three years within which suit could have been brought; and that, in any event, suit on such claims is barred where, as in the cases at bar, the suit is commenced more than three years after the passage of the 1920 act. In each of these cases judgment was entered for the plaintiff. Wabash Ry. Co. v. United States, 59 Ct. Cl. 322; see also Schaff, Receiver, v. United States, 59 Ct. Cl. 318. An appeal to this court, under sections 242 and 243 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. ss 1219, 1220), was taken in each case before June 7, 1924.\n That a statute shall not be given retroactive effect, unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication, is a rule of general application. It has been applied by this court to statutes governing procedure, United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 306\n, 28 S. Ct. 537; and specifically to the limitation of actions under another section of Transportation Act of 1920, fullerton-Krueger Lumber Co. v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n266 \nU.S. 435\n, 45 S. Ct. 143. There is nothing in the language of paragraph 3 of section 16, or in any other provision of the act, or in its history, which requires us to hold that the three-year limitation applies, under any circumstances, to causes of action existing at the date of the Act.\n The government contends that, even if the suits were not barred by Transportation Act of 1920, they were barred by the Act of June 7, 1924, c. 325, 43 Stat. 633 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 8584), which amended paragraph 3, among other things, by making the following addition thereto:\n\n\n[270 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n '(h) The provisions of this paragraph (3) shall extend to and embrace cases in which the cause of action has heretofore accrued as well as cases in which the cause of action may hereafter accrue. ...'\n The Senate and House reports accompanying the bill (s. 2704) state that the purpose of the amendment was to revive claims barred under the existing law as interpreted in Kansas City Ry. Co. v. Wolf, \n261 \nU.S. 133\n, 43 S. Ct. 259, 67 L. Ed 571. It is not to be assumed that Congress intended by that amendment to defeat claims on which suits duly brought were then pending, or on which, as in the cases at bar, judgment had already been entered below. Compare Herrick v. Boquillas Land & Cattle Co., \n200 \nU.S. 96\n, 26 S.

HOLT STATE BANK(1926)\nNo. 47\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 49, 50]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. W. Dyar, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. N. Eckstrom, of Warren, Minn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity by the United States to quiet in it the title to the bed of Mud Lake-now drained and uncovered-in Marshall county, Minnesota, and to enjoin the defendants from asserting any claim thereto. After answer and a hearing the District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill on the merits. The United States appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the decree was affirmed (294 F. 161), and then by a further appeal brought the case here. \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n Mud Lake is within what formerly was known as the Red Lake Indian Reservation, which had an area exceeding 3,000,000 acres and was occupied by certain bands of the Chippewas of Minnesota. Most of the reservation, including the part in the vicinity of Mud Lake, was relinquished and ceded by the Chippewas comformably to the Act of January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642, for the purposes and on the terms stated in that act. It provided that the lands when ceded should be surveyed, classified as 'pine lands' and 'agricultural lands,' and disposed of in designated modes; that such as were classified as agricultural should be disposed of under the homestead law at a price of $1.25 an acre; and that the net proceeds of all, whether classified as pine or agricultural, should be put into an interest-bearing trust fund for the Chippewas and ultimately disbursed for their benefit or distributed among them.\n The cession became effective through the President's approval March 4, 1890. Thereafter the lands in the vicinity of Mud Lake were surveyed and platted in the usual way; the lake being meandered and represented on the plat as a lake. The tracts bordering on the lake were classified as agricultural, opened to homestead entry, and disposed of to homestead settlers; patents being issued in due course. The defendants now own and hold these tracts under the patents. After the homestead entries were allowed, and after most of them were carried to patent, the lake was drained and its bed made bare by a public ditch constructed under the drainage laws of the state. The United States then surveyed the bed with the purpose of disposing of it for the benefit of the Indians under the act of 1889, and later brought this suit to clear the way for such a disposal.\n The lake in its natural condition covered an area of almost 5,000 acres and was traversed by Mud river, a tributary of Thief river, which was both navigable in \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n itself and directly connected with other navigable streams leading to the western boundary of the state and thence along that boundary to the British possessions on the north.\n The ditch which drained the lake was established as a means of fitting for cultivation a large body of swamp lands in that general vicinity. It is as much as 30 miles long, and, like Mud river, passes through the lake and discharges into Thief river. Its depth exceeds that of the lake, and its width and fall are such that it has drawn the water out of the lake. Its construction was begun in 1910, and was so far completed in 1912 that the lake was then effectively drained.\n The swamp lands which the ditch was intended to reclaim were within the ceded portion of the Red Lake Reservation. Some had been disposed of under the act of 1889 and thus had passed into private ownership; but the absence of necessary drainage was preventing or retarding the disposal of the others. Congress caused an examination to be made to determine whether drainage was physically and economically feasible (Act June 21, 1906, c. 3504, 34 Stat. 352, and Act March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1033), and a report of the examination was made (H. R. Doc. No. 607, 59th Cong. 2d Sess .). Shortly thereafter Congress gave its assent to the drainage of the lands under the laws of the state by declaring that all lands not entered and all entered lands for which a final certificate had not issued should 'be subject to all of the provisions of the laws of said state relating to the drainage of swamp or overflowed lands for agricultural purposes to the same extent and in the same manner in which lands of a like character held in private ownership are or may be subject to said laws.' Act May 20, 1908, c. 181, 35 Stat. 169, s 1 (Comp. St. s 4970).\n The laws of the state, to the application of which assent was thus given, authorized the establishment of public drainage ditches by judicial proceedings and provided that \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n such ditches might be so established as to widen, deepen, change or drain any river or lake, even if navigable and whether meandered or not. Laws 1905, c. 230; Gen. Stat. 1913, ss 5523, 5525, 5531, 5553, et seq. The ditch which drained Mud Lake was established by judicial proceedings begun under these laws after the congressional consent was given, and it is not questioned that those proceedings made it entirely lawful to construct the ditch through the lake and to drain it as an incident of the reclamation project in hand.\n The defendants insist that the lake in its natural condition was navigable, that the state, on being admitted into the Union, became the owner of its bed, and that under the laws of the state the defendants, as owners of the surrounding tracts, have succeeded to the right of the state. On the other hand, the United States insists that the lake never was more than a mere marsh, that the state never acquired any right to it, that the surveyor should have extended the survey over it when he surveyed the adjacent lands, and that the United States is entitled and in duty bound to dispose of it under the act of 1889 for the benefit of the Chippewas.\n Both courts below resolved these contentions in favor of the defendants; and whether they erred in this is the matter for decision here.\n It is settled law in this country that lands underlying navigable waters within a state belong to the state in its sovereign capacity and may be used and disposed of as it may elect, subject to the paramount power of Congress to control such waters for the purposes of navigation in commerce among the states and with foreign nations, and subject to the qualification that where the United States, after acquiring the territory and before the creation of the state, has granted rights in such lands by way of performing international obligations, or effecting the use or improvement of the lands for the purposes of commerce \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n among the states and with foreign nations, or carrying out other public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the territory was held, such rights are not cut off by he subsequent creation of the state, but remain unimpaired, and the rights which otherwise would pass to the state in virtue of its admission into the Union are restricted or qualified accordingly. Barney v. Keokuk, \n94 U.S. 324\n, 338; Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 48 S., 57, 58, 14 S. Ct. 548; Scott v. Lattig, \n227 \nU.S. 229, 242\n, 33 S. Ct. 242, 44 L. R. A. (N.

Ed. 140.\n But, as was pointed out in Shively v. Bowlby, at pages 49, 57, 58 (14 S. Ct. 548), the United States early adopted and constantly has adhered to the policy of regarding lands under navigable waters in acquired territory, while under its sole dominion, as held for the ultimate benefit of future states, and so has refrained from making any disposal thereof, save in exceptional instances when impelled to particular disposals by some international duty or public exigency. It follows from this that disposals by the United States during the territorial period are not lightly to be inferred, and should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.\n The state of Minnesota was admitted into the Union in 1858 (11 Stat. 285, c. 31), and under the constitutional principle of equality among the several states the title to the bed of Mud Lake then passed to the state, if the lake was navigable, and if the bed had not already been disposed of by the United States.\n Both courts below found that the lake was navigable. But they treated the question of navigability as one of local law to be determined by applying the rule adopted in Minnesota. We think they applied a wrong standard. Navigability, when asserted as the basis of a right arising under the Constitution of the United States, is necessarily a question of federal law to be determined according to \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 56]\n\u00a0\n the general rule recognized and applied in the federal courts. Brewer- Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra, at page 87 (43 S. Ct. 60). To treat the question as turning on the varying local rules would give the Constitution a diversified operation where uniformity was intended. But notwithstanding the error below in accepting a wrong standard of navigability, the findings must stand if the record shows that according to the right standard the lake was navigable.\n The rule long since approved by this court in applying the Constitution and laws of the United States is that streams or lakes which are navigable in fact must be regarded as navigable in law; that they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their natural and ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water; and further that navigability does not depend on the particular mode in which such use is or may be had-whether by steamboats, sailing vessels or flatboats-nor on an absence of occasional difficulties in navigation, but on the fact, if it be a fact, that the stream in its natural and ordinary condition affords a channel for useful commerce. The Montello, 20 Wall. 430, 439; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 323\n, 37 S. Ct. 380; Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 121\n, 41 S. Ct. 409; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 586\n, 42 S. Ct. 406; Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra, p. 86 (43 S. Ct. 60).\n The evidence set forth in the record is voluminous and in some respects conflicting. When the conflicts are resolved according to familiar rules we think the facts shown are as follows: In its natural and ordinary condition the lake was from three to six feet deep. When meandered in 1892 and when first known by some of the witnesses it was an open body of clear water. Mud river traversed it in such way that it might well be characterized as an \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 57]\n\u00a0\n enlarged section of that stream. Early visitors and settlers in that vicinity used the river and lake as a route of travel, employing the small boats of the period for the purpose. The country about had been part of the bed of the glacial Lake Agassiz and was still swampy, so that waterways were the only dependable routes for trade and travel. Mud river after passing through the lake connected at Thief river with a navigable route extending westward to the Red River of the North and thence northward into the British possessions. Merchants in the settlements at Liner and Grygla, which were several miles up Mud river from the lake, used the river and lake in sending for and bringing in their supplies. True, the navigation was limited, but this was because trade and travel in that vicinity were limited. In seasons of great drought there was difficulty in getting boats up the river and through the lake; but this was exceptional, the usual conditions being as just stated. Sand bars in some parts of the lake prevented boats from moving readily all over it, but the bars could be avoided by keeping the boats in the deeper parts or channels. Some years after the lake was meandered, vegetation such as grows in water got a footing in the lake, and gradually came to impede the movement of boats at the end of each growing season, but offered little interference at other times. Gasoline motor boats were used in surveying and marking the line of the intended ditch through the lake and the ditch was excavated with floating dredges.\n Our conclusion is that the evidence requires a finding that the lake was navigable within the approved rule before stated. From this it follows that no prejudice resulted from the recognition below of the local rule respecting navigability.\n We come then to the question whether the lands under the lake were disposed of by the United States before Minnesota became a state. An affirmative disposal is \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 58]\n\u00a0\n not asserted, but only that the lake, and therefore the lands under it; was within the limits of the Red Lake Reservation when the state was admitted. The existence of the reservation is conceded, but that it operated as a disposal of lands underlying navigable waters within its limits is disputed. We are of opinion that the reservation was not intended to effect such a disposal and that there was none. If the reservation operated as a disposal of the lands under a part of the navigable waters within its limits it equally worked a disposal of the lands under all. Besides Mud Lake, the reservation limits included Red Lake, having an area of 400 square miles, the greater part of the Lake of the Woods, having approximately the same area, and several navigable streams. The reservation came into being through a succession of treaties with the Chippewas whereby they ceded to the United States their aboriginal right of occupancy to the surrounding lands. The last treaties preceding the admission of the state were concluded September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. 1109, and February 22, 1855, 10 Stat. 1165. There was no formal setting apart of what was not ceded, 1 nor any affirmative declaration of the rights of the Indians therein, nor any attempted exclusion of others from the use of navigable waters. The effect of what was done was to reserve in a general way for the continued occupation of the Indians what remained of their aboriginal territory, and thus it came to be known and recognized as a reservation. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 389\n, 22 S. Ct. 650. There was nothing in this which even approaches a grant of rights in lands underlying navigable waters; nor anything evincing a purpose to depart from the established policy, before stated, of treating such lands as held for the \n\n[270 U.S. 49, 59]\n\u00a0\n benefit of the future state. Without doubt the Indians were to have access to the navigable waters and to be entitled to use them in accustomed ways; but these were common rights vouchsafed to all, whether white or Indian, by the early legislation reviewed in Railroad Co. v. Schurmeier, 7 Wall, 272, 287-289, and Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, supra, pp. 118-120 (41 S. Ct. 409), and emphasized in the Enabling Act under which Minnesota was admitted as a state (chapter 60, 11 Stat. 166), which declared that the rivers and waters bounding the state 'and the navigable waters leading into the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of said state as to all other citizens of the United States.' Section 2.\n We conclude that the state on its admission into the Union became the owner of the bed of the lake. It is conceded that, if the bed thus passed to the state, the defendants have succeeded to the state's right therein, and the decisions and statutes of the state brought to our attention show that the concession is rightly made.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Other reservations for particular bands were specially set apart, but those reservations and bands are not to be confused with the Red Lake Reservation and the bands occupying it.

C., and Albert H. Veeder, Henry Veeder, R. C. McManus, Connor B. Shaw, and P. L. Holden, all of Chicago, Ill., for Swift & Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover damages for the loss caused to Swift & Co. by the refusal of the United States to accept a quantity of finished and unfinished army bacon ordered by competent authority for delivery in March, 1919. They only ground for not accepting it was that the need had been removed by the unexpected rapidity of demobilization. The claim was first presented to the War Department under the Act of March 2, 1919, 40 Stat. 1272, known as the Dent Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, ss 3115 14\/15 a- 3115 14\/15 e). It was denied by the Board of Contract Adjustment of the War Department, on the ground that the agreement under which the bacon was produced was not concluded until after November, 1918; the Dent Act applying only to agreements entered into prior to that date. The Secretary of War affirmed this decision. The petition in the Court of Claims alleged that the liability of the government was lawfully established by a written contract properly signed and executed, binding the United States.\n The Court of Claims found that the contract was entered into in due and regular form, and could be enforced under the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and that, even if there were defects in the contract, as the contract had been fully performed in accord with the terms of the contract as subsequently modified by the parties, the alleged defects were immaterial. It accordingly gave judgment for $1,077,386.30, being the difference between the contract price for the bacon ready for delivery in accordance with the contract and the proceeds of its sale. In addition to this amount, Swift & Co. sought damages in the amount of $212,216.69 for more \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n than 1,000,000 pounds of salted bellies, which had been cured, but had not been smoked and made into bacon, and which were on hand at the time the contract was canceled. A large part of these were sold in France at a very large reduction. The Court of Claims held that, by attempting to sell this material abroad, Swift & Co. had taken a speculative course, and could not hold the government for the difference between the contract price and the proceeds of sale. Swift & Co. filed a cross-appeal on this issue, and that is before us.\n The government in the Court of Claims set up a counterclaim against Swift & Co. for $1,571,882, made up of alleged improper and illegal charges presented by the plaintiff to the defendant on account of army bacon delivered from September, 1918, to February, 1919, which were paid by the government by mistake to Swift & Co. in the settlement of bills and accounts so presented. The Court of Claims found that it was not shown to the satisfaction of the court that any improper or illegal charges had been made or paid by mistake, or that any misrepresentation or concealment was practiced by Swift & Co., to the detriment of the government in the settlement. The government appealed from this rejection of the counterclaim, but does not press its appeal.\n The correspondence upon which Swift & Co. asserts the existence of a valid contract in writing before the parties is contained in the sixteenth finding of the Court of Claims:\n'XVI.\n\n'On November 9, 1918, a conference was held on the call of Gen. Kniskern at which he and Maj. Skiles, for the government, were present and representatives of the seven large packers, including Swift & Co., for the purpose of providing allotments of bacon and other meat products for the months of January, February, and March, 1919. The quantity of bacon asked for for the \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n three months stated was 60,000,000 pounds, 30,000,000 pounds each of serials 8 and 10.\n\n'On November 12, 1918, Swift & Co. sent to the general depot of the Quartermaster Corps at Chicago the following communication:\n\n\"Swift & Company, Union Stock Yards,\n\n\"Chicago, November 12, 1918\n\n\n\n\"War Department, General Depot of the Quartermaster Corps, 1819 West 39th Street, Chicago, Illinois.

St. s 6895) in the form of contract required in such cases.\n First. The officers whose names are attached to the papers on behalf of the government are Brig. Gen. A. D. Kniskern, Brigadier General Quartermaster Corps, and Maj. E. L. Roy, Quartermaster Corps, assigned to temporary duty with the Food Administration.\n The finding of the Court of Claims in respect to Gen. Kniskern's authority is as follows:\n'The furnishing of adequate meat supplies for the army was within the authority and duty of the Acting Quartermaster General and afterwards within his authority and duty as Director of Purchase and Storage. Gen. Kniskern, as depot quartermaster at Chicago, was the authorized representative of the Acting Quartermaster General in the purchase of meat supplies, and, while subject to any specific instructions which the Acting Quartermaster General might see fit to give him, his duty was to supply the needs, and specific authority as to each purchase was not required. There was in the office of the Quartermaster General a subsistence division, but the chief duty it exercised in the matter of the purchase of meats was to \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 134]\n\u00a0\n supply Gen. Kniskern with such information as might be available as to future needs, leaving it to him to supply them. The authority of Gen. Kniskern in connection with the establishing in Chicago of a packing house products branch of the subsistence division of the Quartermaster General's Office and in connection with his later appointment as zone supply officer appears in finding V and VI.\n\n'V.\n\n'On July 3, 1918, by Office Order No. 419, Quartermaster General's Office, there was established in Chicago a packing house products branch of the subsistence division of the Quartermaster General's Office, to be located in the general supply depot of the Quartermaster Corps at Chicago, to be under th immediate direction and control of the depot quartermaster, and to be responsible for all matters pertaining to the procurement, production, and inspection of packing house products, subject to the control of the Quartermaster General.\n\n'The interpretation of this order by the then Acting Quartermaster General was 'that whereas the purchasing of supplies was concentrated in Washington, that Chicago being the food market, we delegated to Gen. Kniskern the purchase of meat products and articles of that kind.'\n\n'VI.\n\n'On October 28, 1918, by Purchase and Storage Notice No. 21, issued by Brig. Gen. R. E. Wood, as Director of Purchase and Storage, supply zones were created and by said order the Director of Purchase and Storage appointed 'as his representative in each general procurement zone the present depot quartermaster to act and be known as the zone supply officer,' who was 'charged with authority over and responsibility for supply activities within the zone under his jurisdiction.'\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 124, 135]\n\u00a0\n 'This form of organization in effect transferred the field organization of the Quartermaster Corps to the office of the Director of Purchase and Storage. The procurement divisions which had theretofore existed in the Quartermaster Corps were transferred to the supply zones created in the purchase and storage organization, these zones being practically the same as those formerly existing in the Quartermaster Corps, over each of which the proper depot quartermaster exercised jurisdiction, and the depot quartermasters of the Quartermaster Corps became zone supply officers and representatives, as such, of the Director of Purchase and Storage.\n'Existing orders and regulations of the several supply corps with respect to supply activities transferred to the Director of Purchase and Storage were continued in effect, 'providing that the zone supply officers constituted by the notice shall have final authority in their respective zones over all matters referred to in existing orders and regulations.\"\n\n The Food Administration under the President early in 1918 found that the demand for food commodities was greater than their supply, and it was necessary to suspend the law of supply and demand in respect to their prices, and that large purchases of certain commodities should be made by allocations at fair prices. A Food Purchase Board was formally organized by the President, which, on July 16, 1918, required that canned meats and bacon should be placed on an allotment basis. Gen. Kniskern, as depot quartermaster at Chicago, was notified by the Quartermaster General that thereafter tin bacon and smoked bacon would be allocated by the Food Administration, and he was requested to cancel orders which had been placed with the packers, and ask allotments of the same from the Food Administration. He accordingly in August 1918 canceled the orders for the next four months, but wrote the Food Administration, requesting that they \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 136]\n\u00a0\n confirm the allotments made in accordance with his orders. Thereupon Maj. Roy of the Quartermaster's Department, in the name of the Food Administration, made the allotments. This arrangement continued until the Food Administration gave up its activities, after the Armistice.\n On December 16, 1918, Gen. Kniskern was instructed by Telegraph as follows:\n'December 16, 1918.\n\n'Effective with January requirements, the Army will purchase packing- house products independently of Food Administration.\n\n'This office is notifying Food Administration accordingly. You are authorized to proceed on this basis. Please wire acknowledgment.\n\n Wood, Subsistence, Baker.'\n Thereafter prices for January and February deliveries were determined as they had been during the early months of 1918, before that function came to be exercised by the Food Administration. The course of procedure with reference to giving the orders for bacon and the fixing of the price therefor is shown in the following finding:\n'IX.\n\n'In supplying the needs of the army for bacon and other packing house products during the early stages of the war, the regular method of advertising for and receiving bids and letting contracts to lowest bidders, if otherwise satisfactory, was adhered to, but later on, in 1917 and during 1918, the needs had so grown and were so rapidly approaching the capacity of the packing plants that this method became impracticable, and the necessity for a constant and ever- increasing flow of supplies of this character made necessary the resort to other purchase and procurement methods.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 124, 137]\n\u00a0\n 'The office of the depot quartermaster, afterward the zone supply officer, at Chicago was informed from time to time by the proper authorities at Washington as to the number of men which would be in the service within stated times, and the duty devolved on the depot quartermaster of procuring supplies of the kind in question sufficient for the indicated number of men without the issuance of specific authorization to him in each instance to purchase or specific instructions as to quantities to be purchased. And because of the time required to cure, smoke and can army bacon, it was necessary to anticipate needs therefor.\n'The plan was adopted by the depot quartermaster at Chicago of calling into conference with him or his authorized assistant, from time to time, representatives of this plaintiff and the six other large packing houses, at which conferences the packers' representatives were informed formed as to the needs of the government for a stated period, usually three months, sufficiently in the future to give time for manufacture, and asked to indicate what portion of the stated needs each would furnish. Upon receipt of the statements from the packers as to what quantities they would furnish, which were submitted in writing and usually within a few days after the conference, the depot quartermaster made an allotment to each packer and notified each as to the quantities it would be expected to furnish during each month of the period involved.'\n\n It is quite evident from the findings that in the organization and reorganization of the many agencies needed to furnish the supplies of food in Chicago, there were apparent conflicts of jurisdiction and there were orders issued having on their face general application which in fact by the course of business were limited, and all these orders from the War Department and from the Quartermaster's Department were before the Court of Claims for its consideration. In such a situation the finding of the \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 138]\n\u00a0\n Court of Claims that Gen. Kniskern was the representative of the Quartermastr's Department in making these contracts for bacon is either a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact, and is conclusive on this court. United States v. Omaha Tribe of Indians, 40 S. Ct. 522, \n253 U.S. 275\n, 281; Ross v. Day, 34 S. Ct. 233, \n232 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 117 S., and cases cited. There is nothing whatever in the other findings which is inconsistent with this. At the time this order was given and accepted by Swift & Co. in November, 1918, the Food Administration, by direction of the President, had the authority and duty to act upon the needs of the Quartermaster General's Department for bacon and other food supplies and to approve those orders and allot them to the packing companies who were to deliver the supplies. When, therefore, the accepted orders had been signed both by Gen. Kniskern and by Maj. Roy for the Food Administration, they were certainly authorized in writing on behalf of the government.\n Gen. Kniskern's authority to act in these purchase is questioned on the ground that a Capt. Shugert was the only officer authorized to make such contracts. The objection cannot be sustained. On September 17, 1918, Capt. Jay C. Shugert, Quartermaster Corps, was, by authority of the Acting Quartermaster General, designated as purchasing and contracting officer for the packing house products and produce division of the office of the depot quartermaster at Chicago. This order to Shugert did not vest him with any authority to make contracts for the packing products branch of the subsistence division of the Quartermaster General's office. Before this latter branch was established there was a packing house products and produce division of the depot quartermaster's office at Chicago to which Shugert was attached. There two offices were distinct. The former was a unit of the Quartermaster General's office located at Chicago under the immediate direction and control of \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 139]\n\u00a0\n the depot quartermaster, with general authority to purchase packing house products for the whole army of the United States wherever situated, as shown by the findings. The latter was a unit in the depot quartermaster's office at Chicago and by an order of January 9, 1919, its functions were transferred to a newly organized office of Director of Purchase and Storage, and Capt. Shugert was transferred with it and thereafter signed the so-called formal contracts of January and February. More than this, even if Capt. Shugert had been a purchasing and contracting officer with authority to sign this main contract of November, 1918, it would not have deprived Gen. Kniskern of such power when his authority had been recognized and exercised in the purchase of many millions of pounds of bacon for the government for many months.\n Second. The next objection is that the alleged contract is not complete in its terms, first in that the offers made by Swift & Co. included No. 8 bacon, while the order of the Food Administration and of Gen. Kniskern included nothing but No. 10 bacon. We find no weight in this suggestion. The offer was made by Swift & Co., and it was only accepted by the allotment of the Food Administration to the extent of No. 10 bacon and that allotment was accepted in writing by Swift & Co., which, of course, eliminated bacon No. 8 from the contract.\n Then it is said that in the letter of December 10th an inquiry was made by Gen. Kniskern for information as to where the allotments were to be put up. This was not a term of the contract. It was evidently left to the discretion of Swift & Co. to distribute the allotments as might be convenient to it, and the inquiry was only for information as to the various plants of Swift & Co. at which inspections and deliveries were to be made.\n Then it is said that there was no complete contract because the price was not fixed. Upon this point finding \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 140]\n\u00a0\n No. 10 of the Court of Claims is important. It is as follows:\n'Since there were many elements entering into cost of production as to which there were frequent fluctuations, it was not practicable to undertake to determine prices so far in advance, and accordingly, instead of fixing prices at the time the proposals were submitted, or notices of allotments issued, it was agreed that prices would be determined at or near the first of each month for the product to be furnished during that month. This was at a time when of necessity the preparation of the product, in this instance bacon, was well under way, approaching completion as to a large part thereof and when the cost of the green bellies, the basic element of final cost, and other fluctuating elements of cost were ascertainable.\n\n'At about this time the usual form of circular proposals were sent to the packers, not for use in submitting bids as under the peacetime competitive system, but as a convenient method for formal submission by the packers of their proposals as to price for the product which they had theretofore been directed to furnish during the month in question and which already, by direction of the depot quartermaster, was in process of preparation.\n\n'Upon submission of these proposals as to price, if the same were satisfactory to the depot quartermaster or, otherwise, upon adjustment to a satisfactory basis, purchase orders were issued, which furnished the basis of payment, although the purchase orders frequently were not issued until a part and sometimes all of the product covered thereby had been delivered.'\n\n It was evidently impossible to make a contract fixing the price of the bacon in advance of the partial performance of it, and the price was therefore left to subsequent adjustment. The Food Administration, by its regulations had already determined that the profit of the seller should not exceed 9 per cent. of the investment, or 2 1\/2 per cent. \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 141]\n\u00a0\n of the gross sales. Under ordinary conditions, a valid agreement can be made for purchase and sale without the fixing of a specific price. In such a case a reasonable price is presumed to have been intended. In the case of United States v. Wilkins, 6 Wheat. 135, it was held under a proviso of the contract, which left the price to be adjusted by the government and the contractor, that it was to be the joint act of both parties and not the exclusive act of either, that if they could not agree, then a reasonable compensation was to be allowed, that that reasonable compensation was to be proved by competent evidence and settled by a jury and that the contractor at such a trial was at liberty to show that the sum allowed him by the Secretary of War was not a reasonable compensation. In United States v. Berdan Fire Arms Co., 15 S. Ct. 420, \n151 U.S. 552\n, 569, a suit in the Court of Claims, it was objected that there was no price agreed upon and that the officers of the government were not authorized to agree upon a price. It was held that this was not material. The question was whether there was a contract for the use of the patent in that case, and not whether all the conditions of the use were provided for in such contract, that this was the ordinary rule in respect to the purchase of property or labor. 1 Williston, Contracts, s 41. We find, therefore, that by the writings and documents, all the necessary details making a valid contract were set forth in writing.\n Third. Were they more than mere preliminary data upon which a subsequent formal contract was to be framed and signed? Taking the writings, together, it is quite evident that as between individuals such writings would constitute a single contract for the delivery of 17,000,000 pounds of No. 10 bacon in monthly installments. As the Court of Claims points out:\n'From the inception of the contract here involved bacon for January, February, and March deliveries was the matter to which the parties addressed themselves. At the conference of November 9, \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 142]\n\u00a0\n the total needs for the three months were made known. The plaintiff's proposal, the Food Administration's allotment, in so far as that is material, and Gen. Kniskern's award all covered the three months. Any separation of the month of March and its treatment as a matter of independent negotiation is therefore unauthorized.'\n\n The fact that in January and February there were separate formal contracts of purchase of the bacon deliveries for those months signed by Capt. Shugert and Swift & Co. does not change our view that the original contract was made in November for the three months. These latter contracts were not made until much of the bacon had been delivered and the remainder was nearly ready for delivery and after the price could be determined from the actual cost of purchase of the hogs and the preparation of the bacon. The real function of these so-called formal contracts was to fix the price for the monthly settlements which had been postponed in accordance with the provision of the original contract until it could be fairly determined from the actual cost.\n Fourth. We reach the question whether the contract was evidenced in writing as required by the statutes of the United States? Rev. Stats. s 3744 (Comp. St. s 6895) provides that:\n'It shall be the duty of the Secretary of War, of the Secretary of the Navy, and of the Secretary of the Interior, to cause and require every contract made by them severally on behalf of the government, or by their officers under them appointed to make such contracts, to be reduced to writing, and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof.'\n\n This has been qualified by a provision of a War Appropriation Act of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1062, 1078, c. 143 (Comp. St. s 6853b), reading as follows:\n'That hereafter whenever contracts which are not to be performed within sixty days are made on behalf of the government by the Quartermaster General, or by officers of the Quartermaster Corps authorized to make \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 143]\n\u00a0\n them, and are in excess of $500 in amount, such contracts shall be reduced to writing and signed by the contracting parties. In all other cases contracts shall be entered into under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Quartermaster General.'\n\n It is first contended on behalf of the government that under section 3744, Revised Statutes, the contract must be in one instrument and signed by both parties at the end thereof-that that is the effect of the words 'to be signed at the end thereof.' This section has been before this court a number of times, and it has never been clearly declared by this court to require the contract to be reduced to one instrument. In the case of South Boston Iron Co. v. United States, 6 S. Ct. 7, \n118 U.S. 37\n, the Court of Claims had held that the words 'with their names at the end thereof' required that the signatures should be appended to one instrument, but it was not necessary to the decision of the case. On review in this court, however, the papers relied on were held to be nothing more than preliminary memoranda made by the parties for use in preparing a contract for execution in the form required by law, which was never done. It was said that the whole matter was abandoned by the department after the memoranda had been made and that the Iron Company had never performed any of the work which was referred to and had never been called upon to do so.\n The section has been under consideration before this court also in Clark v. United States, \n95 U.S. 539\n; St. Louis Hay & Grain Co. v. United States, 24 S. Ct. 47. \n191 U.S. 159\n; United States v. Andrews & Co., 28 S. Ct. 100, \n207 U.S. 229\n; United States v. New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co., 36 S. Ct. 41, \n239 U.S. 88\n, 92; Erie Coal & Coke Corporation v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 181, \n266 U.S. 518\n. In no one of these has it been expressly decided that the requirements of section 3744 may not be met by an exchange of correspondence properly signed. But whether the contention by the government be true or not \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 144]\n\u00a0\n as to section 3744, the change in the Appropriation Act of 1915, in which the words 'signed by the parties at the end thereof' are omitted, clearly make unnecessary the evidencing of such contracts with the Quartermaster's Department by reduction to writing and signatures in one instrument. This was a contract made by the Quartermaster's Department and comes exactly within the amendment of 1915, and we see no reason why it does not constitute a binding contract upon the government under the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.\n Some suggestion is made that the signature of Gen. Kniskern to the letter of December 10 was by another. The signature was:\n'By authority of the Director of Purchase and Storage, A. D. Kniskern, Brigadier General, Q. M. Corps, Officer in Charge, by O. W. Menge, 2d Lieut., Q. M. Corps.'\n\n It is evident from subsequent correspondence that Gen. Kniskern recognized this as his signature and as a binding contract. There seems no doubt about the authority of Lieut. Menge to attach his signature or that it was the regular practice in the office. In a similar case the Court of Claims (Union Twist Drill Co. v. United States, 59 Ct. Cl. 909), held that the affixing of the signature of a contracting officer by another duly authorized created no infirmity in the execution of the contract. A similar conclusion was reached by Attorney General Gregory, 31 A. G. 349, and by Attorney General Wirt, 1 A. G. 670. The conclusion we have come to in respect to the regularity and legality of the contract under the act of 1915 makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other ground upon which the Court of Claims sustained this recovery, to wit, full performance. \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 145]\n\u00a0\n This brings us to the question of damages. The government contends that the Court of Claims did not adopt the proper rule in respect to damages. By the letter of January 24, General Kniskern, Zone Supply Officer, notified Swift & Co. that the only bacon the government would take during the month of March, 1919, would be such bacon as was then in process of cure over and above the quantity necessary to take care of the February awards and which had been passed by the inspectors. Swift & Co. received this on January 27th, and at once stopped the putting of bacon in cure, but proceeded with the curing, smoking and canning of bacon already in cure. March 5, 1919, Gen. Kniskern notified Swift & Co. that it would be necessary to discontinue production on all commodities which were not intended to apply against the February contract. Should Swift & Co. have any issue bacon which was now in smoke and which was in excess of the amount required, for the February delivery, it would be accepted. Swift & Co. received this notice on March 6th, and completed the smoking and canning of bacon which was already in smoke. When the notice of March 5th was received by Swift & Co., it had already in smoke for March delivery, 4, 197,672 pounds. This bacon was put up under government inspection. When the order was received, there also remained in process of cure, not needed for February deliveries, and intended for March delivery, 1,068,538 pounds of bellies. These had been prepared under government inspection. On March 22, Swift & Co. notified Gen. Kniskern that at that time it had the bacon practically all packed and ready for delivery. It said,\n'We are very short of storage room at each of these plants and will appreciate your giving us purchase order and shipping instructions in the very near future.'\n\n April 24, Gen. Kniskern wrote Swift & Co. that his office was tak- \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 146]\n\u00a0\n ing preliminary steps toward an adjustment for materials on hand to be applied against the March deliveries, which had been canceled, and requested that a representative of Swift & Co. should be present at a conference to be held at his office on April 29, 1919, 'in order that you may be fully informed as to what methods should be followed by your firm in submitting your claim.' On April 29, he wrote to Swift & Co., inclosing papers 'necessary to prepare in order to file a claim for any amount you may consider due from the various packing house commodities allotted you for delivery during March, 1919, and on which you will suffer a loss by reason of cancellation of those orders.' And in a note of August 29, 1919, Gen. Kniskern, Zone Supply Officer, wrote as follows to Swift & Co.:\n'1. Regarding your claim for the value of bacon prepared by you under allotment given by this office of November 9, 1918, and in view of the fact that this claim is still awaiting action of the Board of Contracts Adjustments in Washington, I desire to state the following:\n\n'... It will be impossible for this office to give you positive and definite instructions as to the disposal of any of this product which may at this time be in your possession. It is, however, realized by this office that the product in question is of a perishable nature. Further, it is an important food product. In view of these two facts, it is believed that these products should be disposed of at the earliest possible moment. It will not be possible for the government to dispose of them until the negotiations are completed and the actual ownership determined by the government, taking them at the agreed price or turning them over to you on a basis similar to the salvage basis of unfinished material.\n\n'3. In the judgment of this office, if you are able to dispose of this product by a sale within the limits of the United States, it would be a perfectly proper procedure, \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 147]\n\u00a0\n bearing in mind, of course, that having made such sale it will be necessary for you, when the later negotiations are in progress, to be able to convince a negotiating officer that the price you may have received for such part of this product as has been sold was justified by the conditions.\n\n'4. In order that you may have some basis on which to proceed, in case you decide to attempt a sale of these products, you are informed that this office, under authority from Washington, is now selling, through the parcel post and to individuals, bacon, serial 10, at $4. 15 per can, or about 34 7\/12 cents per pound.\n\n'5. Any sales that you may make at the price which is now being charged through the parcels post and to individuals would, in the judgment of this office, be entirely in the interests of the government.'\n\n Thereupon Swift & Co. began selling the number 10 bacon it had prepared for March deliveries. It directed its branch houses and agents to sell this at $4.02 a can at wholesale, a price designed to permit the retailer to sell at the government's price and realize a profit for the handling of approximately one cent per pound. It sent out instructions to its representatives that the government was selling at $4.15 a can and added that it was desirable, therefore, that no dealer should sell for less than that. Subsequently, and from time to time, the government reduced its price on army bacon, and the plaintiff followed the government's price in its sales except that in a few localities it was able to procure a better price by reason of its ability to make prompt delivery, which the government could not do. The lowest price realized was $ 2.65 per can, or 22 1\/12 cents per pound, which was at or near the end of the period covered by these sales. The sale of the bulk of this product, approximately 98 1\/2 per cent. thereof, was completed in January, 1920, although there were sales of about 700 cases in February and a few small \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 148]\n\u00a0\n sales thereafter, until October, 1920, during which month the last was sold. For this bacon sold at varying prices the plaintiff received $1,062, 847.54, and its expenses of sale were $160,982.23.\n The Court of Claims found that a fair contract price for the bacon on the basis upon which prices had theretofore been fixed, and the basis upon which it was contemplated by the parties that the price for this bacon would be fixed, was $1,640,146.18; that the cost of the bacon put up by Squire & Co., a subsidiary of Swift & Co., for the account of Swift & Co., was $430,410.48, and the fair contract price therefor as between the plaintiff and the United States on the basis above stated as within the contemplation of the parties was $432,573.34; that the reasonable profit, if it had been permitted to complete and deliver this would have been $5, 021.90, and that the reasonable additional profit accruing to Swift & Co., if it had been permitted to manufacture and deliver serial No. 10 bacon up to 6,000,000 pounds for March delivery, would have been $8,818.30, leaving a balance, after deducting the net proceeds of sale, and certain other small items to be added, of $1.077,386.30.\n We think the necessary effect of the Court of Claims' findings is that Swift & Co. was diligent in disposing of this bacon at the best prices it was possible to secure. There was a very large amount of this particular bacon on the market, and the finding was that it was not particularly salable, because specially prepared under army orders to avoid spoiling; that it was not commercial bacon, like No. 8; that it required more time for preparation, and was not adapted to popular consumption, because of its more salty flavor.\n The government complains that this army bacon might have been sold at an earlier time during the summer when pork was at a higher figure, and would have brought more money, but there is nothing in the findings to make a \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 149]\n\u00a0\n basis for this claim. The uncertainties as to the best method of disposition of such surplus supplies not needed by reason of demobilization justified care and deliberation. Swift & Co. seemed to be properly anxious not to embarrass the government by throwing what it had on the market. The large amount of bacon of this peculiar kind which had to be disposed of made its sale a matter of considerable delay. Swift & Co. were evidently anxious to conform as nearly as possible to the desires of the government, and did so. The bacon of this kind had no market price, and had to be worked off slowly. Under these conditions, there was no standard by which the usual rule of damages, namely the difference between the contract price and the market price, could be the measure of Swift & Co.'s loss through the failure of the government to receive the bacon. This was a case where the only standard could be the contract price and the amount realized at actual sale by diligent effort. The rule is that where there is no general market, or the merchandise is of a peculiar character and not staple, it is necessary that some other criterion be taken than the difference between the agreed price and the general market value. Fisher Hydraulic Stone & Machinery Co. v. Warner, 233 F. 527, 14 C. C. A. 413; Kinkead v. Lynch (C. C.) 132 F. 692; Leyner Engineering Works v. Mohawk Consolidated Leasing Co. (C. C.) 193 F. 745; Manhattan City, etc. Ry. Co. v. General Electric Co., 226 F. 173, 141 C. C. A. 171; Frederick v. American Sugar Refining Co. (C. C. A.) 281 F. 305; Barry v. Cavanaugh, 127 Mass. 394; Dunkirk Colliery Co. v. Lever (C. A.), 9 Ch. Div. 20, 25.\n For these reasons, the measure of damages adopted by the Court of Claims for the bacon which had been prepared under the contract and which the government did not take, was justified.\n We come now to the question of the cross-appeal of Swift & Co. with reference to the bellies which were \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 150]\n\u00a0\n sent abroad for sale in April, after the government had indicated its desire to cancel the orders for March. These bellies had not been made into bacon. Of these 65,225 pounds was sold in the United States at an average price of 33 1\/16 cents per pound. All of the remainder of them were shipped abroad. Those that went to Belgium were sold at 31 cents; to Norway, at 31 cents; to Germany, at 40 cents; and to France, at 16.56 cents. Swift & Co. had theretofore, in ordinary course of business, exported similar products in large quantities, and believed that at this time it would find a good market, because of the widely reported shortage of food products in Europe. With these exportations Swift & Co. had shipped largely of other products on its own account, on which it sustained heavy losses. The Court of Claims in its opinion states that it is quite clear that, in seeking a foreign market for this product, plaintiff was acting in perfect good faith, and in accordance with its best judgment, based on former experiences in exporting and information then at hand as to markets to be anticipated abroad. But the court said that it did not think it could relieve itself from the consequences of its error in seeking a foreign market. 'It is true that it does not appear that it could have made other sales on the basis of those made in New York; on the contrary, it is rather to be implied that other purchasers were not then available, and that the one found would not buy further; but it seems to us that it was the duty of the plaintiff to have relied upon the home market, and to have taken such steps that it might show that it had exhausted that market before resort to a foreign one; and that, in the absence of such a showing, it assumed the risk of procuring such results as would demonstrate that the course taken had resulted beneficially to the other party.'\n We do not agree with this conclusion. We do not think seeking a market in France was so different from \n\n[270 U.S. 124, 151]\n\u00a0\n attempting a sale in the United States as to indicate a disposition to speculate at the expense of the government. In view of the complete good faith manifested by Swift & Co. in this whole transaction, and the willingness on its part to give up its claim for larger damages for failure of the government to take the full March delivery, and, in the absence of proof that the bellies might have been disposed of anywhere else at a better price, we think the same result should be reached in case of the bellies as in that of the bacon. We think the government should pay the difference between the fair contract price, as found by the Court of Claims, and the actual sales of the material remaining. In that view there should be added to the recovery on the cross-appeal $212,216.69, the excess of the contract price over the net amount realized.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly affirmed for the amount already allowed by it, with directions to allow the additional amount now awarded on the cross-appeal. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. DAUGHERTY(1926)\nNo. 303\nArgued: December 1, 1925Decided: January 4, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n Mr. Anthony P. Nugent, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent. \n\n[269 U.S. 360, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment of three counts charged respondent with violating Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785 (Comp. St.  6287g-6287q), by making unauthorized sales of cocaine to three different persons on different days. Each count alleged a completed sale to the named individual on a specified day. The judgment below followed a plea of guilty:\n It is by the court considered and adjudged that said defendant is guilty of the crime aforesaid, and that as punishment therefor said defendant be confined in the United States penitentiary situated at Leavenworth, Kansas, for the term of five (5) years on each of said three counts, and until he shall have been discharged from said penitentiary by due course of law. Said term of imprisonment to run consecutively and not concurrently.\n He took the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and there maintained:\n\n\n (1)\n That the (trial) court erred in imposing a sentence of 15 years upon defendant, James Daugherty; that the court exceeded its jurisdiction in imposing a sentence of 15 years, which is 10 years above the maximum penalty prescribed for a violation of the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, as amended by Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1130 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6287g, 6287l).\n\n\n (2)\n That each of the offenses charged, alleged, and set forth in the indictment constitute a single continuous act inspired by the same intent, which is equally essential to each of the offenses charged in the three counts of said indictment, and the court erred and exceeded its jurisdiction in imposing a sentence of 15 years upon defendant.\n That court interpreted and affirmed the judgment.\n It held that:\n'The contention that each sale should be taken as resulting from one and the same criminal intent and therefore the three counts charge only one crime, is \n\n[269 U.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n not sound; because criminal intent is not an element of the crime, and because each count charges a different sale to a different person and on a different day, and if the sales were made as charged they constituted three separate offenses.' Daugherty v. United States, 2 F.( 2d) 691.\n\n It further concluded that the sentence was for 5 years only and, in support of this view, said:\n'Where sentences are imposed on verdicts of guilty, or pleas of guilty, on several counts or on several indictments consolidated for trial, it is the rule that the sentences so imposed run concurrently, in the absence of specific and definite provision therein that they be made to run consecutively by specifying the order of sequence. If the order in which the terms of imprisonment for the different offenses is to be served, is not clearly designated, the terms are to be served concurrently, and the defendant cannot be held in further confinement under the sentence after the expiration of the longest term imposed. Cumulative sentences are permissible, and in some cases are appropriate, but when imposed on different counts or indictments there must be certainty in the order of sequence.'\n\n Mr. Justice Bradley's opinion in United States v. Patterson (C. C.) 29 F. 775, was cited and relied upon.\n The cause is here by certiorari, granted upon petition of the United States, for whom counsel say:\n'The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals has resulted in an unwarranted alteration and misapplication of the original sentence imposed upon the defendant. The purpose of this proceeding is to restore the original judgment and sentence of the District Court, imposing three consecutive terms of 5 years each.'\n\n The constitutionality of the Anti-Narcotic Act, touching which this court so sharply divided in United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86\n, 39 S. Ct. 214, was not raised below, and has not been again considered. The doctrine approved in Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724, Child Labor Tax \n\n[269 U.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S. Ct. 449, Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 67\n, 42 S. Ct. 453, and Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5\n, 45 S. Ct. 446, may necessitate a review of that question, if hereafter properly presented.\n In denying the contention that the indictment charged but a single crime the court below was clearly right. Further discussion of that point would serve no good purpose. But, we think, it erred in holding that the sentence was for only 5 years.\n Sentences in criminal cases should reveal with fair certainty the intent of the court and exclude any serious misapprehensions by those who must execute them. The elimination of every possible doubt cannot be demanded. Tested by this standard, the judgment here questioned was sufficient to impose total imprisonment for 15 years, made up of three 5- year terms, one under the first count, one under the second, and one under the third, to be served consecutively, and to follow each other in the same sequence as the counts appeared in the indictment. This is the reasonable and natural implication from the whole entry. The words, 'said term of imprisonment to run consecutively and not concurrently,' are not consistent with a 5-year sentence.\n United States v. Patterson, supra, grew out of a sentence under pleas of guilty to three separate indictments. A single judgment entry directed that the prisoner 'be confined at hard labor in the state's prison of the state of New Jersey, for the term of five (5) years upon each of the three indictments above named, said terms not to run concurrently, and from and after the expiration of said terms until the costs of this prosecution shall have been paid.' The question there was materially different from the one here presented, which concerns counts in one indictment. We think the reasoning of that opinion is not applicable to the present situation. Neely v. United States (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 849, 852, 853, is more nearly in point. \n\n[269 U.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n This and similar unfortunate causes should admonish the trial courts to require the use of meticulously precise language in all judgment entries. Especial care is essential where sentences for crime are imposed.\n We deem it proper to add that the sentence of 15 years imposed upon respondent seems extremely harsh. Circumstances not disclosed by the record may justify it, but only extraordinary ones could do so.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the one entered by the District Court is affirmed. The cause will be remanded to the latter court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. MINNESOTA MUT. INV.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Edwin H. Park, of Denver, Colo., for defendant in error.[ U.S. v. Minnesota Mut. Inv. Co. \n271 U.S. 212\n (1926) ]\n\n\n[271 U.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Minnesota Mutual Investment Company is a corporation of South Dakota, doing business in Colorado. It sued the United States for $571.26, under the Tucker Act (Judicial Code,  24, par. 20 (Comp. St.  991)). Its claim arises under the following circumstances: In a cause pending in the United States District Court for Colorado, the Investment Company was plaintiff, and McGirr and others were defendants. The plaintiff was required to place in the registery of the court $15,143.92, which the clerk of the court immediately deposited in the First National Bank of Denver, Colo., designated by the court as one of its depositaries. The money remained in the bank to the credit of the court from June 7, 1918, until May 6, 1920, when it was returned to the Investment Company. During that period the bank paid interest on this deposit of 2 per cent. per annum, semiannually into the United States Treasury for the use of the government. The \n\n[271 U.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n petition alleges that for a long series of years prior to this, interest paid by the bank on such court funds had been added to the deposit for the benefit of the party adjudged to own it, but that shortly before this deposit the Secretary of the Treasury, by regulation, required all United States depositaries having court funds to pay interest at 2 per cent. to the Treasurer of the United States for its use.\n The petition avers that the United States was not interested in the sum of money so deposited, had no right, title, or interest therein, directly or indirectly, and that the interest so paid was and is the property of the plaintiff, and was received by the United States for the use and benefit of the plaintiff, and judgment was asked therefor.\n The United States filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was overruled. It then answered alleging that the United States, through its proper officers, had entered into a contract concerning the payment of interest upon all government deposits, including the court funds, carried with the bank by virtue of its designation as a depositary of the United States, under the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under authority conferred upon him by the laws of the United States; that this contract considered of an offer made on behalf of the United States and its acceptance by the First National Bank by its President, and that accordingly $571.26 was paid to the United States by the bank; that in consideration of such payment the United States allowed the bank the use of all government deposits held on deposit, allowed the bank the prestige and advertising connected with its handling of such government deposits, kept safe in its custody the collateral security pledged by the bank to secure the deposits, and supervised the depositary in all matters in connection with the deposit. Accompanying the answer was the correspondence claimed to em- \n\n[271 U.S. 212, 216]\n\u00a0\n body the contract between the United States and the bank. A demurrer to the answer of the defendant was sustained, and the judgment for $571.26 followed. Direct appeal to this court was allowed to the United States under the Tucker Act (Act of March 3, 1887,  4 and 9, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505 (Comp. St.  1574, 1172)), because taken before the taking effect of the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936, c. 229,  14).\n Section 995 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1644) provides:\n'All moneys paid into any court of the United States, or received by the officers thereof, in any cause pending or adjudicated in such court, shall be forthwith deposited with the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, or a designated depositary of the United States, in the name and to the credit of such court: Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the delivery of any such money upon security, according to agreement of parties, under the direction of the court.'\n\n Rule 20 of the Rules of the District Court of Colorado contains the following:\n'1. All moneys brought into court shall be paid to the clerk of the court, unless the court shall otherwise direct, and when not immediately paid to the party entitled, be deposited by said clerk, in his name of office, with such depositary as may be designated by law, or by the court, when no place is so designated. The amount so received, the purpose for which it was paid into court, together with the fact of the deposit, as herein provided, shall be noted by the clerk in the civil or criminal dockets of the court in the particular cause in which it is received. All interest paid on said deposits shall become a part thereof.'\n\n Section 251 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  384) provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may make rules and regulations relative to public moneys and officers concerned therewith. Section 5153 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by later acts (Comp. St.  9691), provides in effect that all national \n\n[271 U.S. 212, 217]\n\u00a0\n bank associations designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be depositaries of public money under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary and they are to perform all such reasonable duties as depositaries of public money as may be required of them. The Secretary is to require them to give satisfactory security, by the deposit of United States bonds, for the safe keeping of the public money deposited with them.\n The court below found that the Secretary of the Treasury had no power under these two sections to direct national banks to pay interest on deposits of court founds to the United States and that his authority to make such a regulation for interest extended only to public moneys, and not to court funds belonging to the parties to the litigation awaiting adjudication as to ownership or proper disposition. The conclusion of the court was that the United States had therefore received interest which should have been paid to the defendant in error, the Investment Company, and which it may recover from the United States.\n But the Solicitor General argues that even if the United States had no right to collect the interest from the bank, no cause of action was created in favor of the Investment Company against the United States for this illegal collection, that there was no contract of the government, express or implied, by reason of that collection to pay it to the Investment Company, and that without this, no recovery can be had. This seems to us to be sound reasoning. An implied contract in order to give the Court of Claims or a district court under the Tucker Act jurisdiction to give judgment against the government must be one implied in fact and not one based merely on equitable considerations and implied in law. Merritt v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 338, 340\n, 341 S., 45 S. Ct. 278; Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121\n, 39 S. Ct. 56; Sutton v.

There is nothing in the averments in the pleadings in this case to show that the officers of the government collected this interest or that it was received into the treasury for the benefit of the Investment Company.\n The judgment is reversed. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Baldwin, both of Baltimore, Md., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States to recover the difference between the amount to which a check paid by it had been fraudulently raised and the amount for which the check was drawn. The case was heard upon a demurrer to the declaration and the judgment was for the defendant both in the District Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 1 F.(2d) 888. The facts alleged are as follows: A disbursing clerk drew a United States Veteran's Bureau check upon the Treasurer of the United States in favor of one Beck, for $47.50. After it was issued the check was changed so as to call for $4750. Beck endorsed it to a bank of South Carolina and received the amount of the altered check. That bank endorsed it: 'Pay to the order of Any Bank, Banker, or Trust Company. All prior endorsements guaranteed, June 3, 1922,' negotiated it to the defendant, and received the same amount. The defendant endorsed the check, 'Received Payment Through the Baltimore Clearing House, Endorsements Guaranteed, June 5th, 1922,' delivered it to and received the same amount from the Baltimore Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, the agent of the plaintiff, which forwarded the check to the Treasurer of the United States and was given credit for $4,750. The Baltimore Branch had no notice of the fraudulent change.\n The Government argues that acceptance or payment of a draft or check although it vouches for the signature of the drawer does not vouch for the body of the instrument, Espy v. First National Bank of Cincinnati, 18 Wall. 604; that this rule is not changed by section 62 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Article 13, section 81, Maryland Code of Public General Laws: 'The acceptor, by accepting the instrument, engages that he will pay it according to the tenor of his acceptance;' that the drawer and \n\n[270 U.S. 527, 534]\n\u00a0\n drawee of the check were not the same in such sense as to charge the drawee with knowledge of the amount of the check, and that therefore the United States can recover as for money paid under a mistake of fact. The defendant urges several considerations on the other side, but it is enough to say that the last step in the Government's argument seems to us, as it did to the Circuit Court of Appeals, unsound. If the drawer and the drawee are the same the drawer cannot recover for an overpayment to an innocent payee because he is bound to know his own checks. Bank of United States v. Bank of Georgia, 10 Wheat. 333. In this case there is no doubt that in truth the check was drawn by the United States upon itself.\n The Government attempts to escape from this conclusion by the fact that the hand that drew and the hand that was to pay were not the same, and some language of Chief Justice White as to what it is reasonable to require the Government to know in paying out millions of pension claims. The number of the present check was 48218587. United States v. National Exchange Bank, 29 S. Ct. 665, \n214 \nU.S. 302, 317\n, 16 S. Ann. Cas. 1184. But the Chief Justice used that language only to fortify his conclusion that the United States could recover money paid upon a forged endorsement of a pension check. He cannot be understood to mean that great business houses are held to less responsibility than small ones. The United States does business on business terms. Cooke v. United States, \n91 U.S. 389\n. It has been suggested that the ground of recovery for a judgment under a mistake of fact is that the fact supposed was the conventional basis or tacit condition of the transaction. Dedham National Bank v. Everett National Bank, 59 N. E. 62, 177 Mass. 392, 395, 83 Am. St. Rep. 286. If this be true, then when the United States issues an order upon itself it has notice of the amount and when it comes to pay to an innocent holder making a claim as of right it is at arm's length and takes the risk. We are of opinion that the United States is \n\n[270 U.S. 527, 535]\n\u00a0\n not excepted from the general rule by the largeness of its dealings and its having to employ agents to do what if done by a principal in person would leave no room for doubt.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

C., for the United States.\n Mr. Duane R. Dills, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding commenced in the federal court for Northern Alabama, under Revised Statutes of the United States,  3450 (Comp. St.  6352), to forfeit an automobile 'said to belong to Garth Motor Company,' on the ground that it was being used with intent to defraud the United States of the tax on distilled spirits found therein by depositing and concealing the liquor. \n1\n The libel, which was filed in September, 1923, recites that it is 'a case of seizure on land under the internal revenue laws of the United States.' The company intervened as claimant and moved to quash the libel. It also filed a claim by which it asserted title to the automobile and denied \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n knowledge or notice, prior to seizure, that the automobile was being used or was to be used in any illegal manner. No action was ever taken on the claim. The motion to quash was allowed; and upon that motion alone the District Court entered judgment dismissing the libel. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 4 F.(2d) 528. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n268 \nU.S. 687\n, 45 S. Ct. 640\n\n\n The libel alleges that on August 11, 1923, the federal prohibition director for Alabama had seized the automobile in the possession of one Killian being used by him 'for the purpose of depositing and concealing certain illicit distilled spirits' on which 'the taxes imposed by law had not been paid' with 'intent ... to defraud the United States of such taxes,' alleges that the automobile is forfeit under section 3450, and prays relief thereunder. To the libel is attached, and made part thereof, a complaint, dated August 13, 1923, by a federal prohibition agent. In that complaint, the affiant charged, with specification, only that Killian unlawfully had there in his possession 27 quarts of rye whisky, in violation of section 29 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (Act Oct. 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 316 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 p)), and he prayed that Killian 'may be apprehended and further dealt with according to law.' The complaint made no reference to removal or transportation of liquor; nor to the use of a vehicle for such purpose, nor to any seizure, nor to section 26 of the Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 mm). It did not even mention an automobile or other vehicle. Nor did the libel state that a warrant issued on the complaint, or that Killian had been arrested or in any way prosecuted for any alleged violation of the Prohibition Act, or that his whereabouts was known.\n The sole question for decision is whether an automobile, which was seized by a prohibition agent, may be forfeited under section 3450, if it was being used for the purpose \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n of depositing or concealing tax-unpaid illicit liquors with the intent to defraud the United States of the taxes imposed thereon. Obviously the mere fact that the seizure of the automobile had been made by the prohibition director (instead of by an internal revenue officer) does not preclude the possibility of a proceeding to forfeit under section 3450. It is settled that, where property declared by a federal statute to be forfeited, because used in violation of federal law, is seized by one having no authority to do so, the United States may adopt the seizure with the same effect as if it had originally been made by one duly authorized. The Caledonian, 4 Wheat. 99, 101; Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 205. See United States v. One Studebaker Seven- Passenger Sedan (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 534.\n The serious question presented is whether there is such a direct conflict between the National Prohibition Act, and particularly section 26 of title 2 thereof, and section 3450 of the Revised Statutes, as to render the latter section inoperative and unavailable to the government, where the vehicle was being used for the purpose of depositing and concealing illicitly distilled liquors under the circumstances set forth in the libel. On this question there has been much difference of opinion in the lower courts. \n2\n If a forfeiture may be had under section 3450 for such use of a vehicle to evade a tax on illicitly distilled liquor, the interests of innocent persons in the vehicle are not saved. If section 26 is the only applicable provision for forfeiture of the car, the interests of those who are innocent are not forfeited. The claimant contends, on several grounds, \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n that section 3450 was not applicable and that the libel was properly dismissed.\n First. The claimant contends that, at the time of the seizure, the law did not impose any tax upon liquor illicitly made. Congress has power to tax such liquor. United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 \nU.S. 450, 462\n, 41 S. Ct. 551; United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477, 480\n, 43 S. Ct. 197. By Rev. Stats.  3248 (Comp. St.  5982) the tax attaches to distilled spirits 'as soon as it is in existance as such' ( United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States, 220 F. 592, 136 C. C. A. 50), and upon its production the tax becomes a first lien thereon ( United States v. Ulrici, \n111 \nU.S. 38, 42\n, 4 S. Ct. 288). The Revenue Act of 1918 (Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18  600, 40 Stat. 1057, 1105 (Comp. St.  5986e)), lays the tax 'on all distilled spirits now in bond or that have been or that may be hereafter produced in or imported into the United States.' The provision in section 600b of the act (Comp. St.  5986f), concerning liquor which could not during the period of warprohibition be lawfully sold or removed, did not remit the tax; it merely deferred, the time for payment. It is clear that, before the enactment of the National Prohibition Act, it imposed the basic production tax upon all distilled spirits, although illicitly made. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The continued existence of taxes upon illicit liquor is indicated in section 35 of the National Prohibition Act (page 317 (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 v)), which provides:\n'This act shall not relieve anyone from paying any taxes or other charges imposed upon the manufacture or traffic in such liquor.'\n\n That Congress in enacting that law would intentionally have exempted illicit liquor from taxation, is not likely. Moreover, we are not dealing with the construction of the law as enacted in 1919. The Willis-Campbell Act (Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 134,  5, 42 Stat, 222, 223 (Comp. St.  10138 4\/5 c)), sup- \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n plemental thereto, continued in force or re-enacted, by express provision, all laws in regard to the taxation of intoxicating liquor not directly in conflict with the prohibitory legislation. Furthermore, the Revenue Act of 1921 (Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 136  600, 42 Stat. 227, 285 (Comp. St.  5986 e)), enacted on the same day, shows that Congress had no intention then of relieving liquor from taxation merely because illegally dealt with; for it provided specifically that if distilled spirits, tax-paid for nonbeverage purposes, be diverted to beverage purposes, an additional tax of $4.20 per gallon must be paid, although under the law such diversion could not be made legally.\n The claimant argues that it could not have been the intention of Congress to impose the tax, because it had become very difficult, if not impossible, to pay the tax. The claimant points to the fact that the payment of the tax contemplated by the revenue laws existing at the time of the passage of the National Prohibition Act was by means of tax-paid stamps, to be affixed when liquor was withdrawn from the distillery or bonded warehouse, after complying with the minutely prescribed proceedings incident to its manufacture and custody set forth in Taney v. Penn Nat. Bank, \n232 U.S. 174\n, 181-184, 34 S. Ct. 288; that since the National Prohibition Act, there has been no way in which the tax could be so paid on intoxicating liquor made for beverage purposes; that stamps are no longer obtainable and no officer is authorized to receive payment. These supervening obstacles to paying the tax do not, however, establish that the intention was not to continue it in force. A law which imposes a tax on intoxicating liquor, whether legally, or illegally made, is not in conflict with another law which prohibits the making of any such liquor. Compare United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477\n, 43 S. Ct. 197; Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, \n258 \nU.S. 403\n, 42 S. Ct. 330. There is no direct conflict between any provision of the prohibitory legislation and the imposition of the tax here in question. \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n Second. The claimant contends that the so-called tax on illicitly distilled spirits theretofore imposed ceased to be a tax, and became in law a penalty, when the enactment of the National Prohibition Act changed the purpose of the tax from raising revenue to preventing manufacture, sale, and transportation, and that to enforce such penalty by forfeiture of the property rights of innocent third partied would be a denial of due process of law. It is true that the use of the word 'tax' in imposing a financial burden does not prove conclusively that the burden imposed is a tax, and that, when it appears from its very nature that the imposition prescribed is a penalty solely, it must be treated in law as such. But the imposition here in question is not of that character. A tax on intoxicating liquor does not cease to be such because the sovereign has declared that none shall be manufactured, and because the main purpose in retaining the tax is to make law breaking less profitable. What was sought to be enforced and held to be a penalty in Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557, 561\n, 42 S. Ct. 549, was the so-called double tax. Here, we are dealing with the basic production tax.\n With respect to the character of the impositions called taxes, there is nothing in either the Revenue Acts or the Prohibition Act which makes any distinction between the product of legal and illegal distillation. The acts left in effect the basic tax of $2.20 per gallon, which was and is a true tax on the product, whether legally or illegally distilled, and added to it the additional amounts in case of illegal distillation or diversion to illegal uses. These additional amounts also are called taxes by Congress, and were understood by it to be such. Whether they were intrinsically penalties, and should be treated as such, we need not determine. The basic tax of $2.20 a gallon on liquor illegally produced is not imposed because of illegality, but despite of it. It is a tax within the meaning of section 3450, and, being unpaid, makes that \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n section applicable even if the additional amounts imposed by the acts be deemed penalties. Moreover, there is no constitutional objection to enforcing a penalty by forfeiture of an offending article. Lipke v. Lederer holds merely that the enforcement of a penalty by an administrative official, without giving notice and an opportunity to defend, is a denial of due process. A proceeding under section 3450 is a judicial proceeding, in which the claimant is accorded fully the right to litigate. A claim was filed in this case, but that is not now before us. Instead of asking for a hearing thereon, the claimant chose to move to quash the libel. If the judgment dismissing the libel is set aside, a hearing on the merits of the libel and of the claim may still be had. But we may not consider now allegations in the claim.\n Third. The claimant contends that a proceeding under section 3450 will not lie to forfeit a vehicle, unless it was being used to remove the tax-unpaid article from the place where the tax was required by law to be paid; that is, the place of manufacture or of importation or a bonded warehouse. This narrow meaning of the word 'remove' is urged upon us, as contrasted with the broad term 'transport' employed in section 26. We have no occasion to determine the exact scope, in this connection, of the term 'remove.' The libel makes no reference to removal. It charges only that the automobile was being used to deposit or conceal.\n Under section 3450, it is not essential that the offender must have been either the manufacturer or importer of the liquor, or a person directly associated with him. The government may look for payment also to the liquor itself and to whoever has possession of it. Nor does the language of section 3450, or its history, indicate that Congress intended to limit the proceeding under that section to cases where the vehicle was used for deposit or concealment as part of the illegal act of removal, or to make it \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n applicable only where the article concealed had been unlawfully removed from the place where the tax should have been paid. If the intent to defraud the United States of the tax is established by any competent evidence, a use of the vehicle for the purpose of concealment satisfies the requirement of section 3450, even if it appears that the offender obtained it, not from a distillery, bonded warehouse, or importer, but from a stranger.\n It is argued that Killian's purpose cannot have been to evade the tax; that it was only to violate the Prohibition Act. The place from which the removal is made, and the special relation to the manufacturer or importer of him who used the vehicle, are of evidential significance only. Knowledge that liquor was illicitly distilled may tend to prove knowledge that it was tax-unpaid. Removal or concealment of the liquor with such knowledge may tend to prove an intention to deprive the United States of the tax due thereon. But with these questions we have no concern now. The case is here on review of a judgment of dismissal upon a motion to quash. Therefore we must accept as true the allegations of the libel.\n Fourth. The claimant contends that section 3450, in so far as it applied to intoxicating liquor, was superseded by section 26 of the National Prohibition Act. There was no repeal in terms. There cannot be held to have been a repeal by implication, unless section 3450 is in direct conflict with some provision of the National Prohibition Act or of the supplemental act; for Congress has declared in section 5 of the Willis- Compbell Act that, in ascertaining its intention in this connection, the standard of mere inconsistency, which had been applied in United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 \nU.S. 450\n, 41 S. Ct. 551, shall not prevail.\n The two statutes cover different ground. Different purposes underlay their enactment. Section 3450, extending to every taxed article, seeks to enforce the obli- \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 331]\n\u00a0\n gation to pay the tax by subjecting to forfeiture also articles used in the attempt to evade such payment. The purpose of section 26 is to prevent the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquor. Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 154\n, 155 S., 157, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790. It is true that many acts punishable under section 3450 are punishable also under section 26. But many are not. Thus section 3450 applies to a vehicle, whether used for removal, deposit, or concealment, and even although the vehicle is not in motion and movement was never contemplated; section 26 applies only to a vehicle used in transporting contrary to law. Section 3450 may apply, although a permit was obtained to transport the liquor; section 26 cannot. On the other hand, section 3450 as applied to liquor relates only to that on which taxes have not been paid; section 26 applies whether taxes have been paid or not. It is clear that the mere existence of two provisions penalizing acts which are part of the same transaction does not prove direct conflict between them. Nor does the difference in purpose which underlay their enactment.\n In the absence of conflict resulting from differences in the scope and purposes of the statutes, the claim of implied repeal must rest upon essential conflict incident to the prescribed methods of their operation. None such has been shown. Direct conflict is not established by showing merely differences in details of procedure. That some other mode of disposition must now take the place of the requirements in section 3450 for the sale of the seized liquor is not sufficient to establish a conflict of the provisions as applied to a seized vehicle. To establish an implied repeal there must, under the legislative mandate, be shown some necessary contradiction, so extreme as to justify this court in finding it impossible to permit the government the choice between the two remedies where the facts bring the offense within the provisions of both statutes. Such a contradiction is said to exist, because \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 332]\n\u00a0\n under section 3450 the vehicle is the offender, and must be forfeited if there is a guilty intent on the part of him who used it, whereas under section 26 a person is the offender and the forfeiture of the vehicle extends only to the interests of those who share in his guilt by having notice that it was to be used for the illegal purpose; that under section 3450 the vehicle may be forfeited, although no person is convicted of the offense involved or is even prosecuted, whereas under section 26 there can be no forfeiture, unless there has been a conviction of one discovered in the act of transportation in violation of law. But it is not true that these differences show direct conflict. The provisions for forfeiture of the vehicle and for arrest of the transporter are both incidental to the main purpose of section 26 of reaching and destroying the forbidden liquor in process of transportation. Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 155\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790. The contradiction urged relates only to the nature of the incidental penalty and the effect of its imposition. It is clearly possible to apply to a particular state of facts either one or the other remedy, and to give to the government the choice. To hold that where the tax-unpaid spirits were illegally distilled, there could be forfeiture of the vehicle only under section 26 while in case of tax-unpaid legally distilled liquor the vehicle could be forfeited under section 3450, would involve holding that where the crime of tax evasion is preceded by the offense of illegal distillation, a less severe forfeiture is inflicted than if tax evasion alone were involved.\n Fifth. The claimant contends that section 26 has modified section 3450, as applied to intoxicating liquors, so as to deny a forfeiture of the interest in the vehicle of one who had no guilty knowledge that it was to be used for an illegal purpose. That there was no such protection of the innocent interest prior to the National Prohibition Act is conceded. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 505\n, 41 S. Ct. 189. That, since the Willis-Campbell Act, Congress \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 333]\n\u00a0\n has not intended to restrict any remedy theretofore given in aid of the revenue laws is clear. The argument that by section 26 Congress manifested the intention to protect generally innocent interests is unfounded. The section is narrow in scope. The protection accorded is stated explicitly. It does not apply generally to violations of the Prohibition Act, nor to the violation of any provision of the revenue laws. It applies solely to cases of forfeiture incident to the prosecution, as therein provided, of a person transporting liquor by a vehicle in violation of the Prohibition Act.\n The suggestion is made that in this view of section 3450 there may be a forfeiture where a stranger has surreptitiously deposited or concealed the liquor in the vehicle while in the possession and use of the owner, or has obtained possession of the vehicle by theft and then made such use of it. But we are not here concerned with such a state of facts, and therefore may dismiss the suggestion by repeating what was said of like possibilities pressed on our attention in the Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. Case (page 512 (41 S. Ct. 191)):\n'Whether the indicated possibilities under the law are justified we are not called upon to consider. It has been in existence since 1866, and has not yet received such amplitude of application. When such application shall be made it will be time enough to pronounce upon it; and we also reserve opinion as to whether the section can be extended to property stolen from the owner or otherwise taken from him without his privity or consent.'\n\n Sixth. The claimant contends that, as applied to intoxicating liquors, section 3450 and section 26 are alternative remedies, and may not be employed cumulatively. Section 26 commands that, when a person is discovered in the act of transporting, by means of a vehicle, intoxicating liquors in violation of the law, the officer shall take possession of the vehicle and shall arrest the person in charge thereof; that the person shall be proceeded against for \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 334]\n\u00a0\n the violation; that, pending the proceeding against him, the vehicle shall be surrendered to the owner upon giving bond to return it to the custody of the officer on the day of the trial to abide the judgment of the court; that, in case of conviction of the person, the vehicle shall be sold under conditions and in a manner prescribed; that the proceeds remaining after paying the expenses shall be paid over to lienors innocent of wrongdoing; and that, unless and except so far as there are such lienors or others entitled thereto, the net proceeds shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States. The claimant insists not only that the government must elect between section 26 and section 3450, but that the commencement of proceedings under section 26 bars a resort to section 3450.\n The case at bar does not present any conceivable question of cumulative remedies or of election. While the second sentence in section 26 uses the words 'transported or possessed,' the context makes it very plain that the possession intended is possession in transportation. \n4\n Hence that section is applicable only if a person is discovered in the act of transporting intoxicating liquor in violation of law. There is no allegation in the libel that the automobile had been so discovered or was being so used. There is no allegation that Killian, who had possession of the automobile, has ever been prosecuted. It appears that a complaint was made, but not that a warrant issued, or that he was arrested, or even that he was found. The \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 335]\n\u00a0\n motion to quash must be determined on the showing in the libel.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (concurring).\n I agree that the Willis-Campbell Act requires section 3450 of the Revised Statutes and section 26 of the National Prohibition law to be so construed as to stand together in so far as they are not in direct conflict. I agree also that there conceivably may be a deposit or concealment of illicit liquor in an automobile with intent to defraud the United States of the tax upon it, which is not transportation within the meaning of section 26, and to that extent the two sections are not in conflict. But I cannot subscribe to those expressions in the opinion which seem to suggest that the two sections are not in direct conflict, in a case where there is transportation of liquor in a vehicle in violation of the National Prohibition law with intent to defraud the United States of the tax. In that case section 26, it seems to me, plainly directs that the seizure shall be made and proceedings for forfeiture of the seized vehicle had under that section. In that event section 26 saves the interest of the innocent owner or lienor from the forfeiture required by section 3450. It appears to me that the conflict in such a case is direct, and that section 26 by its terms is controlling.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n\n 1. \nNo tax, as distinguished from penalty, is imposed on the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.\n The Eighteenth Amendment by its own force invalidated all laws which in any manner sanctioned the manufacture, sale, or transportation of such liquor. National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 386\n, 40 S. Ct. 486, 588. And it empowered Congress to pass appropriate legislation to enforce the prohibition. The manufacture of intoxicating liquor \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 336]\n\u00a0\n for medicinal or other nonbeverage purposes may be authorized or encouraged; but an attempt so to deal with liquor for beverage purposes would be a plain violation of the amendment.\n If Congress has any power to impose a tax, as distinguished from a penalty, on the production of beverage liquor forbidden by the Constitution, its purpose so to do must be disclosed unmistakably by language that is not susceptible of any other meaning. All exactions now imposed on such manufacture should be held to be penalties to enforce prohibition. The question whether the exactions called taxes were in fact penalties was not involved in United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 \nU.S. 450, 462\n, 41 S. Ct. 551, or in United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477\n, 43 S. Ct. 197. When reading and applying the legislation here in question, it should be borne in mind that it is the duty of Congress to impose penalties to enforce the prohibition of beverage liquor, and that Congress has undertaken vigorously to discharge that duty.\n The libel for condemnation of the automobile does not refer to the statute under which the so-called tax is claimed, and does not state the amount demanded. But the government relies on section 600(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, approved February 24, 1919. 40 Stat. 1057, 1105, c. 18. This provision was enacted before the War Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  3115 11\/12 f-3115 11\/12 h), the Eighteenth Amendment, and the National Prohibition Act took effect. The language is:\n'That there shall be levied and collected on all distilled spirits now in bond or that have been or that may be hereafter produced in or imported into the United States, ... in lieu of the internal- revenue taxes now imposed thereon by law, a tax of $2.20 (or, if withdrawn for beverage purposes or for use in the manufacture or production of any article used or intended for use as a beverage, a tax of $6.40) on each proof gallon, ... to be paid by the distiller or importer when withdrawn, and collected under the provisions of existing law.' \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 337]\n\u00a0\n And, after national prohibition became effective, that provision was amended by section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227, 285, c. 121), which added:\n\n'Provided, that on all distilled spirits on which tax is paid at the nonbeverage rate of $2.20 per proof gallon and which are diverted to beverage purposes ... there shall be levied and collected an additional tax of $4.20 on each proof gallon, ... to be paid by the person responsible for such diversion.'\n\n The government contends that, within the meaning of section 3450, $2. 20 per gallon is a true tax on all liquor whether legally or illegally distilled. And as to the imposition made by section 600 of the act of 1921 it rightly says that the so-called additional tax of $4.20 on each proof gallon diverted to beverage purposes is a penalty. Clearly it is an imposition by way of punishment to enforce prohibition.\n The $6.40 exaction per gallon specified in section 600(a) of the act of 1918 cannot be claimed as the liquor was not 'withdrawn' for beverage or at all. That exaction was imposed before national prohibition. It applied to all distilled spirits then in bond or that had been or thereafter might be produced or imported into the United States, with exceptions not here material. But, when the Eighteenth Amendment and the National Prohibition Act became effective, the production of beverage liquor was prohibited. Intoxicating liquors cannot be 'withdrawn for beverage purposes.' The whole charge of $6.40 per gallon was held to be a penalty, and not a tax, in Regal Drug Co. v. Wardell, \n260 \nU.S. 386, 289\n, 392 S., 43 S. Ct. 152.\n But it is said that the continued existence of taxes, as distinguished from penalties, on liquor for beverage purposes, is indicated by section 35 of the National Prohibition Act. The meaning of the sentence on which the majority relies will be more clear when other provisions there found are called to attention. The section pro- \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 338]\n\u00a0\n vides:\n'All provisions of law that are inconsistent with this act are repealed only to the extent of such inconsistency and the regulations herein provided for the manufacture or traffic in intoxicating liquor shall be construed as in addition to existing laws.'\n\n Manifestly, these 'regulations' apply only to nonbeverage liquor, because the manufacture, sale, or transportation of beverage liquor is forbidden by the Constitution. The section proceeds:\n'This act shall not relieve any one from paying any taxes or other charges imposed upon the manufacture or traffic in such liquor.'\n\n This is the sentence relied on. That the 'taxes' there mentioned relate to nonbeverage liquor is apparent from the sentence immediately following:\n'No liquor revenue stamps or tax receipts for any illegal manufacture or sale shall be issued in advance, but upon evidence of such illegal manufacture or sale a tax shall be assessed against, and collected from, the person responsible for such illegal manufacture or sale in double the amount now provided by law (meaning that imposed on liquor lawfully made) with an additional penalty of $500 on retail dealers and $1,000 on manufacturers. The payment of such tax or penalty shall give no right to engage in the manufacture of sale of such liquor, or relieve anyone from criminal liability, nor shall this act relieve any person from any liability, civil or criminal, heretofore or hereafter incurred under existing laws.'\n\n As to nonbeverage liquor legally made, the tax is upon production. That is the only 'tax.' The further exaction is a special imposition to enforce prohibition. As to beverage liquor, the so-called double tax together with the additional penalty of $500 or $1,000, as the case may be, is upon the person responsible. It is a punishment by penalty in a sum equal to double the tax plus the specified 'additional penalties.' The amount cannot be paid as a tax. The liability attaches only on commission of crime-'illegal manufacture or sale.' \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 339]\n\u00a0\n In Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557\n, 42 S. Ct. 549, it was held that these exactions are penalties. The court said (pages 561, 562 (42 S. Ct. 551)):\n'The mere use of the word 'tax' in an act primarily designed to define and suppress crime is not enough to show that within the true intendment of the term a tax was laid. Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 U.S. 20\n (42 S. Ct. 449). When by its very nature the imposition is a penalty, it must be so regarded. Helwig v. United States, \n188 U.S. 605\n, 613 (23 S. Ct. 427). Evidence of crime ( 29) is essential to assessment under section 35. It lacks all the ordmary characteristics of a tax, whose primary fanction 'is to provide for the support of the government' and clearly involves the idea of punishment for infraction of the law-the definite function of a penalty, O'Sullivan v. Felix, \n233 U.S. 318\n, 324 (34 S. Ct. 596).\n\n Again, after the effective date of the Eighteenth Amendment, a collector of internal revenue levied under section 600(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 a 'so-called assessment or tax at the rate of $6.40 per gallon' on distilled liquors withdrawn from bonded warehouses between October, 1918, and June, 1920. This court reiterated what it had said in Lipke v. Lederer, and held that the sums so imposed were penalties, not taxes. Regal Drug Co. v. Wardell, supra, pages 389, 392 (43 S. Ct. 152). The exaction of $6.40 per gallon there claimed included the $ 2.20 per gallon for which the automobile in this case is held subject to confiscation.\n Section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222, 223, is also relied on. The purpose of that section is clear when regard is had to the scope of the act of which it is a part. That is 'An act supplemental to the National Prohibition Act.' It was passed to aid enforcement of prohibition, and not to raise revenue. It authorizes and purports to regulate the prescribing of liquors for medicinal purposes, prohibits importation and manufacture until the supply then in dis- \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 340]\n\u00a0\n tilleries and other bonded warehouses shall be reduced to an amount not sufficient for nonbeverage purposes, permits spirits produced in this country and exported to be returned for redeposit in bonded warehouses from which originally taken, extends the National Prohibition Act to all the territory of the United States, and makes all violators liable to the penalties provided for in the original act.\n The words upon which the majority relies are these:\n'That all laws in regard to the manufacture and taxation of and traffic in intoxicating liquor, and all penalties for violations of such laws that were in force when the National Prohibition Act was enacted, shall be and continue in force, as to both beverage and nonbeverage liquor, except such provisions of such laws as are directly in conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act or of this act; but if any act is a violation of any of such laws and also of the National Prohibition Act or of this act, a conviction for such act or offense under one shall be a bar to prosecution therefor under the other. All taxes and tax penalties provided for in section 35 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act shall be assessed and collected in the same manner and by the same procedure as other taxes on the manufacture of or traffic in liquor.'\n\n Then follows a provision exempting from taxation spirits lost by theft from distilleries or other bonded warehouses without negligence or collusion, and the act provides punishment for certain misconduct of government enforcement officers and others.\n The act does not make a 'tax' out of what was, before its passage, a 'penalty.' It does not change the classification of exactions declared in Lipke v. Lederer and Regal Drug Co. v. Wardell. The Constitution forbids, and the National Prohibition Act denounces as crime, the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. The exactions in respect \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 341]\n\u00a0\n of such liquor were properly to be considered to enforce prohibition and to punish violations of law. The Willis-Campbell Act expressly saved all measures for enforcement. The exaction still depends on the commission of crime. The government's argument that the total charge of $6.40 per gallon is to be divided, so that $4,20 of that amount may be regarded as penalty aimed at beverage liquor, and $2.20 as a tax imposed on all liquor, is without support in the language used, and is contrary to the decisions of this court. It was beverage liquor that Killian had in the automobile. The nonbeverage rate does not apply.\n\n 2. \nThere is direct conflict between section 26 and section 3450 in respect of the disposition of vehicles seized. The facts disclosed by the record bring the case under section 26.\n Section 3450 relates to all goods and commodities on which taxes are imposed, and it provides that whenever any such things 'are removed, or are deposited or concealed in any place, with intent to defraud the United States of such tax, ... all such goods and commodities ... shall be forfeited; and in every such case ... every ... carriage, or other conveyance whatsoever, ... and all things used in the removal or for the deposit or concealment thereof, respectively, shall be forfeited.'\n Section 26 of the National Prohibition Act lays down the course to be followed by the enforcing officers. They are given no discretion. It provides:\n'When the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any ... automobile , ... or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. Whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer he shall take possession of the vehicle ... and shall arrest any person in charge \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 342]\n\u00a0\n thereof. Such officer shall at once proceed against the person arrested under the provisions of this title ... but the said vehicle ... shall be returned to the owner'\n\n -upon giving a bond conditioned to return the vehicle to the officer on the day of the trial to abide the judgment of the court. Upon conviction of the person arrested the court is required to order the liquor destroyed, 'and unless good cause to the contrary is shown by the owner, shall order a sale by public auction' of the vehicle, and the officer making the sale, after deducting expenses, the fee for seizure and costs of sale shall pay all liens according to their priorities which are established at the hearing 'as being bona fide and as having been created without the lienor having any notice that the carrying vehicle was being used or was to be used for illegal transportation of liquor, and shall pay the balance of the proceeds into the Treasury. ...' All liens are transferred from the property to the proceeds. If no one shall be found claiming the vehicle notice by publication is required, 'and if no claimant shall appear within ten days ... the property shall be sold and the proceeds after deducting the expenses and costs shall be paid into the Treasury. ...'\n Section 3450 forfeits the vehicle of an innocent owner or lienor. Section 26 expressly protects his property. The conflict as to the disposition of the automobile is direct, and that is the matter in controversy.\n The great weight of judicial opinion is that illicit whisky is not subject to a tax, as distinguished from a penalty. This is held in the Second, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits, and in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. No Circuit Court of Appeals has held directly that such a tax is imposed; and the decisions of the lower courts are overwhelmingly to the effect that section 26, National Prohibition Act, and R. S. section 3450, are in direct conflict. It is so held by the Circuit Court of \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 343]\n\u00a0\n Appeals of the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits, and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. The Ninth Circuit has certified the question here in Port Gardner Investment Co. v. United States (No. 173) \n272 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S. Ct. 165, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this day.\n There is shown in the margin substantially in chronological order the reported decisions since National Prohibition in the Circuit Courts of Appeals and District Courts, bearing on the application of section 3450 in respect of intoxicating liquors. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 321, 344]\n\u00a0\n 3. The opinion proceeds on the theory that transportation of whisky in the automobile is not shown outside the claim of the Garth Motor Company. And it is held \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 345]\n\u00a0\n that, the dismissal being set aside, hearing on the question whether Killian was transporting the whisky may be had in the lower court. It seems to me the litigation need not be so delayed, and that the important question \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 346]\n\u00a0\n pressing for decision should be decided now. It is true that the allegations of the company's claim are not to be considered on the motion to quash the libel; but, quite \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 347]\n\u00a0\n independently of the company's allegations, the court would be fully warranted in holding that Killian was found offending against section 26. The government does not \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 348]\n\u00a0\n here contend that he was not taken while violating that section; it does not attempt to avoid decision on the merits. On the other hand it urges that, where one is taken in the act of transporting whisky in the automobile of another, the vehicle may be forfeited, notwithstanding the owner appears and shows that he was innocent. It insists that, in case of conviction of the driver for transportation, the interest of the guilty may be forfeited, and, if the tax is not paid on the illicit beverage, the interest of the innocent owner may be confiscated. The claimant challenges that position squarely.\n The information filed by the United States on September 18, 1923, states that this is a 'case of seizure on land under the internal revenue laws of the United States; there is attached and made a part of the information an affidavit and sworn complaint by R. A. Smith, a federal prohibition agent, which charges that Killian, on or about August 11, 1923, unlawfully had in his possession 27 quarts of whisky for beverage purposes, otherwise than as authorized by the National Prohibition Act; and the information alleges that Edgar N. Read, acting prohibition director, seized the automobile described 'which said automobile was then and there in the possession of one Ed. L. Killian and being used by him for the purpose of depositing and concealing' the 27 quarts of whisky, that the automobile was said to belong to the Garth Motor Company, and that Read 'now has the same in his custody.' It states that the automobile was being used by Killian with intent to defraud the United States of taxes on the whisky, and that the automobile 'then and there contained' the whisky.\n The information-with apparent purpose-avoids the use of the word 'removal,' found in section 3450; it does not allege that the whisky had been 'withdrawn,' and so was subject to the $2.20 tax specified in section 600(a); and it also avoids the word 'transporting,' used in section 26. It \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 349]\n\u00a0\n does not show whether the automobile was moving or standing still when discovered and seized by the prohibition officers. If transportation in the automobile had been alleged, the owner would have opportunity to show his innocence under section 26. The purpose of the pleader in avoiding the use of the word 'transporting' was to forfeit the automobile of an innocent owner, on the theory that section 3450 would then apply, and that section 26 need not be followed.\n When the information was filed, the court issued a writ of attachment, commanding the marshal to attach the automobile 'which is now being held by Edgar N. Read, acting prohibition director,' to detain it until the further order of the court, and to give notice to the claimant. The marshal made his return that he had executed the writ by handing a copy to Acting Director Read and by seizing the automobile. December 6, 1923, the claimant filed a motion to quash the libel. April 14, 1924, it filed its claim, alleging that the title to the automobile which was seized while being used by Killian 'in and about the unlawful transportation of intoxicating liquors' was in the company, subject to a conditional sales contract, and gave the bond provided for in section 26, which was approved by the district judge. The motion to quash was sustained and the libel was dismissed. The District Judge filed no opinion. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 4 F.(2d) 528. In its opinion that court said:\n'The position now taken by the government in this case is that the interest of an innocent owner or lienholder may be forfeited if the automobile is standing still, but that such interest is protected if the automobile is in motion. That view could easily result in manifest injustice; for under it, as an illustration, the interest of an innocent holder of a lien on an automobile could be forfeited upon proof that, while it was parked on a public street, liquor was concealed in it \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 350]\n\u00a0\n by some one who had the intent to defraud the government of its internal revenue tax.'\n\n And the court held that section 3450 is superseded by section 26, in so far as there is conflict between them. It dealt with the case as one involving a violation of section 26.\n I think that court's interpretation of the record was right. The prohbition agent discovered Killian in possession of an automobile containing 27 quarts of illicit whisky in violation of the National Prohibition Act. The agent seized the vehicle; and, as it was his duty so to do, it must be found that he also seized the whisky. The prosecution of Killian was commenced by filing complaint charging him with the crime of illegal possession in violation of that act. The facts stated make out 'transportation.' The use of automobiles for transportation of, and in the furtherance of traffic in, intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, is so notorious that, when Killian was found unlawfully possessing illicit whisky in the automobile, he reasonably may be held to have been transporting, even though the vehicle happened to be standing still at the moment the prohibition agent discovered the crime and made the seizure. The facts alleged in the libel and complaint attached to it justify a finding that he was using the automobile for transportation of the whisky. On proof of such facts, a denial of transportation by Killian would not be entitled to respectful attention. Moreover, when these facts are considered in the light of what every one knows, they utterly fail to support the allegation that Killian had the illicit whisky concealed in the automobile with intent to defraud the United States of a tax on that whisky. Indeed, the facts alleged negative that purpose. The attempt to make out a case against the revenues has no foundation in fact. It was impossible to pay the so-called tax. Crime had to be committed before liability for the imposition arose. Taxes are not so conditioned. \n\n[272 U.S. 321, 351]\n\u00a0\n I am of opinion that the decree should be affirmed:\n\n 1. \nSection 3450 does not apply. There was no tax, as distinguished from penalty, imposed upon the whisky that Killian had in the automobile when discovered by the prohibition agent.\n\n 2. \nSection 26 directs the proceedings to be taken in respect of the vehicle 'whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer.' The libel brings the case within the words and meaning of the clause just quoted.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whenever any goods ... in respect whereof any tax is or shall be imposed ... are removed, or are deposited or concealed in any place, with intent to defraud the United States of such tax; ...

Carriage of illegally imported liquors is within the terms of section 3062 and section 26, so later and milder provision prevails.\n Commercial Credit Co. v. United States (C. C. A., 6th Cir., 1925), 5 F.(2d) 1, reversing N. D. Ohio. Libel under section 3450. Car used for removal of liquor. Seizure under section 26 and those in charge convicted thereunder. Forfeiture reversed. Held, there is direct conflict. Liquor not subject to tax, for section 600 does not apply, and section 35 forbids issuance of stamps. Section 3450, repealed by inconsistency with National Prohibition Act; not within terms of Willis-Campbell Act. Section 26 protects property of innocent owners; section 3450 forfeits it, and this is a conflict.\n United States v. One Marmon, etc. (D. C. N. D. Ga., 1925) 5 F.(2d) 113. Judgment of forfeiture under section 3450. Held, United States must show specific intent to defraud; that is done by showing any one has possession of liquor on which no tax has been paid, and has no intention of paying it.\n United States v. Milstone (Ct. App. D. C., 1925) 6 F.(2d) 481, 55 App. D. C. 356, affirming municipal court, D. C. Dismissal of libel under section 3450 affirmed. Car containing moonshine abandoned by driver who was not apprehended. Seized 'on behalf of' collector of internal revenue. Held, section 3450 has no application. No tax can be paid on such liquor, for issuance of stamps forbidden. Failure to pay tax mere incident of illegal possession and transportation, unlawful in any event. Unless two statutes distinguished, section 26 dead letter.\n United States v. Deutsch (D. C. N. J.) 8 F.(2d) 54. Deutsch convicted of violation of National Prohibition Act. Owner of car in which he was transporting, and which he had rented, gave bond for its release and moves to discharge bond. Granted. Held, section 26, and \n not section 3450, applies; owner of auto being innocent, there can be no forfeiture.\n United States v. One Ford, etc. (Tenn., 1925). Not reported. Libel under section 3450 dismissed.\n National Bond & Investment Co. v. United States (C. C. A., 7th Cir., 1925) 8 F.(2d) 942, reversing E. D. Ill. Libel under section 3450 of car seized in 1924 for transporting. Driver pleaded guilty to violation of National Prohibition Act. Libel set forth that liquor came from Canada and was brought in without payment of customs duties. No averment this car brought it in. Decree of forfeiture reversed. Held, since passage of Willis-Campbell Act, it cannot be held that section 3450 was repealed by National Prohibition Act. Must show intent to defraud by establishing that car was used in smuggling; no such averment here.\n United States v. One Reo, etc. (C. C. A., 2d Cir., 1925) 9 F.(2d) 529, affirming E. D. N. Y. Two libels of auto truck. One under section 26, for transportation of whisky without permit; other under section 3450 charging removal and concealment to avoid tax. Truck stopped on Long Island carrying whisky. No conviction of driver; bona fide claimant. District Court dismissed both libels. Held, when vehicle is used in transporting, conviction of offender is essential to its forfeiture, at least when there is bona fide lienor. Under such circumstances, direct conflict between section 26 and section 3450, and latter does not apply at all. No decision as to whether same is true, if there be no such lien. United States v. One Chevrolet, etc. (D. C. E. D. Mo., 1925) 9 F.(2d) 85. Libel under section 3450 dismissed. Driver arrested while transporting illicit liquor; not yet tried. Held no tax, as distinguished from penalty, on manufacture of illicit liquor; on these facts irreconcilable conflict between section 3450 and section 26, and latter applies.\n United States v. Three Quarts Whisky (D. C. S. D. N. Y., 1925) 9 F.( 2d) 208. Libel of automobile under section 3450 dismissed, on ground that section 26 had superseded section 3450.\n Compare The Ella (D. C. S. D. Fla., 1925) 9 F.(2d) 411; United States v. Lincoln, etc. (D. C. N. D. N. Y., 1925) 11 F.(2d) 551; The Squanto (C. C. A., 2d Cir., 1926) 13 F.(2d) 548; United States v. One Chevrolet, etc. ( D. C. W.

RAMSEY(1926)\nNo. 1061\nArgued: April 22, 1926Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Messrs. Wm. S. Hamilton, of Pawhuska, Okl., and S. P. Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendants in error. \n\n[271 U.S. 467, 468]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendants in error, two white men, were charged, by an indictment returned in the court below, with the murder of one Henry Roan, a full-blood Osage Indian and a legal member of the Osage Tribe, committed 'in Osage county, in said district, in the Indian country, and in and upon the reservation theretofore and then established by law of the United States for the Osage Tribe of Indians, on and in a certain tract of land therein which was then and there under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and comprised a restricted surplus allotment, theretofore made under and according to \n\n[271 U.S. 467, 469]\n\u00a0\n the Act of Congress approved June 28, 1906, ... the title to which said allotment ... was held in trust by the United States and was inalienable' by the allottee, who had never had issued to her a certificate of competency authorizing her to sell the allotment. The indictment is drawn under section 2145, Rev. St. (Comp. St.  4148), which extends the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of crimes committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, to the Indian country, with certain exceptions not material here. The court below sustained a demurrer to this indictment upon the ground that the allotment described in the indictment as the locus of the crime was not Indian country within the meaning of section 2145. Thereupon, the construction of the statute upon which the indictment is drawn being involved, the case was brought here on writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704).\n The authority of the United States under section 2145 to punish crimes occurring within the state of Oklahoma, not committed by or against Indians, was ended by the grant of statehood. United States v. McBratney, \n104 U.S. 621\n, 624; Draper v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 240\n, 17 S.Ct. 107. But authority in respect of crimes committed by or against Indians continued after the admission of the state as it was before (Donnelly v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 243, 271\n, 33 S. Ct. 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710), in virtue of the long-settled rule that such Indians are wards of the nation, in respect of whom there is devolved upon the federal government 'the duty of protection and with the power' ( United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 384\n, 6 S. Ct. 1109). The guardianship of the United States over the Osage Indians has not been abandoned; they are still the wards of the nation (United States v. Osage County, \n251 \nU.S. 128, 133\n, 40 S. Ct. 100; United States v. Nice, \n241 \nU.S. 591, 598\n, 36 S. Ct. 696); and it rests with Congress alone to determine when that relationship shall cease \n\n[271 U.S. 467, 470]\n\u00a0\n (Matter of Heff, \n197 \nU.S. 488, 499\n, 25 S. Ct. 506; United States v. Celestine, \n215 \nU.S. 278, 290\n, 30 S. Ct. 93).\n The sole question for our determination, therefore, is whether the place of the crime is Indian country within the meaning of section 2145. The place is a tract of land constituting an Indian allotment, carved out of the Osage Indian reservation and conveyed in fee to the allottee named in the indictment, subject to a restriction against alienation for a period of 25 years. That period has not elapsed, nor has the allottee ever received a certificate of competency authorizing her to sell. As pointed out in Unitted States v. Bowling, \n256 \nU.S. 484, 486\n, 41 S. Ct. 561, there are two modes by which Indians are prevented from improvidently disposing of their allotments. One is by means of a certificate, called a trust patent, by the terms of which the government holds the land for a period of years in trust for the allottee with an agreement to convey at the end of the trust period. The other mode is to issue a patent conveying to the allottee the land in fee, but prohibiting its alienation for a stated period. Both have the same effect, so far as the power of alienation is concerned, but one is commonly called a trust allotment, and the other a restricted allotment. The judgment of the court below turns upon this narrow difference.\n In United States v. Pelican, \n232 \nU.S. 442\n, 34 S. Ct. 396, a case involving the murder of an Indian upon a trust allotment, this court held (page 449 (34 S. Ct. 399)) that trust allotments retain 'during the trust period a distinctively Indian character, being devoted to Indian occupancy under the limitations imposed by federal legislation,' and that they are embraced within the term 'Indian country' as used in section 2145. But the opinion makes it clear that the difference between a trust allotment and a restricted allotment, so far as that difference may affect the status of the allotment as Indian country, was not regarded as important. The court said:\n\n\n[271 U.S. 467, 471]\n\u00a0\n 'The explicit provision in the act of 1897, as to allotments,1 we do not regard as pointing a distinction, but rather as emphasizing the intent of Congress in carrying out its policy with respect to allotments in severalty, where these have been accompanied with restrictions upon alienation or provision for trusteeship on the part of the government. ... The allottees were permitted to enjoy a more secure tenure, and provision was made for their ultimate ownership without restrictions. But, meanwhile, the lands remained Indian lands, set apart for Indians under governmental care, and we are unable to find ground for the conclusion that they became other than Indian country through the distribution into separate holdings, the government retaining control.'\n The essential identity of the two kinds of allotments-so far as the question here under consideration may be affected-was recognized in the Bowling Case, where it was said (page 487 (41 S. Ct. 562)) that in one class as much as the other 'the United States possess a supervisory control over the land and may take appropriate measures to make sure that in inures to the sole use and benefit of the allottee and his heirs throughout the original or any extended period of restriction.' In practical effect, the control of Congress, until the expiration of the trust or the restricted period, is the same.\n Since Congress possesses the broad power of legislating for the protection of the Indians wherever they may be within the territory of the United States, the question presented is not one of power but wholly one of statutory construction. Viewed from that premise, it would be \n\n[271 U.S. 467, 472]\n\u00a0\n quite unreasonable to attribute to Congress an intention to extend the protection of the criminal law to an Indian upon a trust allotment and withhold it from one upon a restricted allotment, and we find nothing in the nature of the subject-matter or in the words of the statute which would justify us in applying the term 'Indian country' to one and not to the other.\n It follows that the judgment sustaining the demurrer to the indictment is erroneous, and must be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This refers to chapter 109, 29 Stat. 506 (Comp. St.  4137), an act to prohibit the sale of intoxicating drinks to Indians. It provides that the term 'Indian country' shall 'include any Indian allotment while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the government, or while the same shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the United States. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. STATE OF MINNESOTA(1926)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 181, 183]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. W. Dyar, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 181, 190]\n\u00a0\n Messrs, M. J. Brown and G. A. Youngquist, both of St. Paul, Minn., and Charles R. Pierce, of Miami, Fla., for the State of Minnesota.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 181, 191]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought in this court by the United States against the state of Minnesota to cancel \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 192]\n\u00a0\n patents issued to her for certain lands under the swamp land grant, or, where the state has sold the lands, to recover their value and to leave the patents uncanceled as to such lands. Seven patents, for about 153,000 acres, are brought in question. The first was issued May 13, 1871, and the others at different times from May 17, 1900, to June 10, 1912. The bill was filed May 7, 1923. The state answered, and the case was heard and submitted on the pleadings and much documentary evidence. The issues presented are chiefly of law.\n It is not questioned that the lands were swampy and in this respect within the swamp land grant, nor that the patents were sought by the state and issued by the land officers in good faith. But it is insisted, on behalf of the United States, first, that by treaties and other engagements with the Chippewa Indians, entered into before the patents were issued, the United States became obligated to apply the lands and the proceeds of their sale exclusively to the use, support, and civilization of the Chippewas, and that this operated to exclude or withdraw the lands from the swamp land grant; secondly, that the state failed to select or claim the lands within the period prescribed in the act making the grant, and thereby lost any right which she may have had to have them patented to her; and, thirdly, that the grant was subject to a condition whereby the state was required to apply the lands or the proceeds of their sale in effecting their reclamation by means of needed ditches, and that before the patents were issued the state, by an amendment to her Constitution, had disabled herself from complying with that condition and proclaimed her purpose to apply the lands and their proceeds otherwise, and thereby and lost any right she may have had to receive the patents. Stating it in another way, the insistence, on the part of the United States, is that the lands were appropriated or set apart for the Chippewas, that the land officers, misconceiving their au- \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 193]\n\u00a0\n thority in the premises, issued the patents contrary to the provisions of the act making the swamp land grant and in disregard of obligations to the Indians which the United States had assumed and was bound to respect, that those obligations are still existing and must be performed, and that to enable the United States to proceed with their performance it is entitled to a cancellation of the patents as respects such of the lands as still are held by the state and to recover the value of such as she has sold.\n Besides disputing the several contentions just stated, the state advances two propositions, either of which her counsel conceive must end the case.\n The first proposition is that the suit is essentially one brought by the Indians against the state, and therefore is not within the original jurisdiction of this court. In support of the proposition it is said that the United States is only a nominal party, a mere conduit through which the Indians are asserting their private rights; that the Indians are the real parties in interest, and will be the sole beneficiaries of any recovery; and that the United States will not be affected, whether a recovery is had or denied.\n It must be conceded that, if the Indians are the real parties in interest and the United States only a nominal party, the suit is not within this court's original jurisdiction. New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 2 S. Ct. 176, \n108 U.S. 76\n; Hans v. Louisiana, 10 S. Ct. 504, \n134 U.S. 1\n; North Dakota v. Minnesota, 44 S. Ct. 138, \n263 U.S. 365\n, 374-376. But the allegations and prayer of the bill-by which the purpose and nature of the suit must be tested-give no warrant for saying that the Indians are the real parties in interest and the United States only a nominal party. At the outset the bill shows that the Indians, although citizens of the state, are in many respects, and particlarly in their relation to the matter here in controversy, under the guardianship of the \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 194]\n\u00a0\n United States and entitled to its aid and protection. This is followed by allegations to the effect that the Indians had an interest in the lands before and when they were patented to the state, that the patents were issued by the land officers without authority of law and in violation of an existing obligation of the United States to apply the lands and the proceeds of their sale exclusively to the use and benefit of the Indians, and that it is essential to the fulfillment of that obligation that the lands-or, where any have been sold, their value in their stead-be restored to the control of the United States. And the prayer is for a decree compelling such a restoration and declaring that the lands and moneys are to be held, administered, and disposed of by the United States conformably to that obligation.\n Whether in point of merits the bill is well grounded or otherwise, we think it shows that the United States has a real and direct interest in the matter presented for examination and adjudication. Its interest arises out of its guardianship over the Indians, and out of its right to invoke the aid of a court of equity in removing unlawful obstacles to the fulfillment of its obligations, and in both aspects the interest is one which is vested in it as a sovereign.

Ct. 204, \n254 U.S. 570\n, 575; Cramer v. United States, 43 S. Ct. 342, \n261 U.S. 219\n, 232; United States v. Beebe, 8 S. Ct. 1083, \n127 U.S. 338\n, 342-343; United States v. New Orleans Pacific Ry. Co., 39 S. Ct. 175, \n248 U.S. 507\n, 518. And see United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., 6 S. Ct. 1006, \n118 U.S. 120\n, 126; In re Debs, 15 S. Ct. 900, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 584\n\n\n Counsel for the state point out that the Indians could neither sue the state to enforce the right asserted in their behalf nor sue the United States for a failure to call on the state to surrender the lands or their value, and from this they argue that the United States is under no duty, \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 195]\n\u00a0\n and has no right, to bring this suit. But the premise does not make for the conclusion. The reason the Indians could not bring the suits suggested lies in the general immunity of the state and the United States from suit in the absence of consent. Of course, the immunity of the state is subject to the constitutional qualification that she may be sued in this Court by the United States, a sister state, or a foreign state. United States v. Texas, 12 S. Ct. 488, \n143 U.S. 621\n, 642, et seq.. Otherwise her immunity is like that of the United States. But immunity from suit is not based on and does not reflect an absence of duty. So the fact that the Indians could not sue the United States for a failure to demand that the state surrender the lands or their value does not show that the United States owes no duty to the Indians in that regard. Neither does the fact that they could not sue the state show that the United States is without right to sue her for their benefit. But it does make for and emphasize the duty, and therefore the right, of the United States to sue. This is a necessary conclusion from the ruling in United States v. Beebe, supra, where much consideration was given to the duty and right of the United States in respect of the cancellation of patents wrongly issued. This court there pointed out special instances in which the government might with propriety refrain from suing and leave the individuals affected to settle the question of title by personal litigation, and then said that where the patent, if allowed to stand 'would work prejudice to the interests or rights of the United States, or would prevent the government from fulfilling an obligation incurred by it, either to the public or to an individual, which personal litigation could not remedy, there would be an occasion which would make it the duty of the government to institute judicial proceedings to vacate such patent.'\n The state's second proposition is that the suit is barred by the provision in the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, s 8, \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 196]\n\u00a0\n 26 Stat. 1095, 1099, being Comp. St. s 5114 (also chapter 559, p. 1093), limiting the time within which the United States may sue to annul patents, and, if not by that provision, then by a law of the state. But both branches of the proposition must be overruled. The provision in the act of 1891 has been construed and adjudged in prior decisions-which we see no reason to disturb-to be strictly a part of the public land laws and without application to suits by the United States to annul patents, as here, because issued in alleged violation of rights of its Indian wards and of its obligations to them. Cramer v. United States, supra, page 233 ( 43 S. Ct. 342); La Roque v. United States, 36 S. Ct. 22, \n239 U.S. 62\n, 68; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 33 S. Ct. 368, \n227 U.S. 355\n, 367. And it also is settled that state statutes of limitation neither bind nor have any application to the United States, when suing to enforce a public right or to protect interests of its Indian wards. United States v. Thompson, \n98 U.S. 486\n; United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., supra, pages 125, 126 (6 S. Ct. 1006); Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, 39 S. Ct. 407, \n250 U.S. 123\n, 125.\n We come therefore to the merits, which involve a consideration of the past relation of the Indians to the lands and of the nature and operation of the swamp land grant to the state.\n The lands are all within the region formerly occupied by the Chippewas. By a treaty made in 1837 the Indians ceded the southerly part of that region to the United States (7 Stat. 536); and by a treaty made in 1855 they ceded to it a further part adjoining that ceded before (10 Stat. 1165). But by the latter treaty nine reservations were set apart out of the ceded territory as 'permanent homes' for designated bands. Four of these reservations were called the Mille Lac, the Leech Lake, the Winnibigoshish, and the Cass Lake. This was the situation ion 1860, when the swamp land grant theretofore made to other states was extended to Minnesota. Most of the \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 197]\n\u00a0\n lands in question are within what was then ceded territory and outside those reservations. The rest are within the Mille Lac, Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as then defined.\n By a treaty made in 1863 six of the reservations, including the Mille Lac, but not the Leech Lake, the Winnibigoshish, or the Cass Lake, were ceded to the United States, and a large reservation surrounding the Leech Lake, the Winnibigoshish, and the Cass Lake Reservations, was set apart as 'future homes' for the Indians then on the ceded reservations. 12 Stat. 1249. The twelfth article of that treaty declared that the Indians were not obligated to remove from the old reservations to the new until certain stipulations respecting preparations for their removal were complied with by the United States. The United States complied with the stipulations and most of the Indians on the ceded reservations other than the Mille Lac removed, but some remained on and around those reservations. The same article declared:\n'Owing to the heretofore good conduct of the Mille Lac Indians (the bank occupying the ceded Mille Lac reservation), they shall not be compelled to remove as long as they shall not in any way interfere with or in any manner molest the persons or property of the whites.'\n\n Some of the Mille Lac band removed, but many remained on and around the ceded reservation. A treaty negotiated in 1864, and amended and ratified in 1865, enlarged the large reservation set apart in 1863. 13 Stat. 693. By a treaty made in 1867 the greater part of the large reservation set apart in 1863 and enlarged in 1865 was ceded to the United States, and an area of approximately 36 townships around White Earth Lake was set apart as a new reservation, to which the Indians in the ceded territory were to remove. 16 Stat. 719. That treaty left the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations within what remained of the large reservation established in 1863 and \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 198]\n\u00a0\n 1865. After the White Earth Reservation was created, many of the Indians in the ceded territory removed to it, but some remained on or around the ceded tracts. By executive orders made in 1873, 1874, and 1879, additions were made to some of the reservations. The next change came in 1889.\n Under the Act of January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642, the Chippewas ceded and relinquished to the United States all of their reservations, here described as then existing, save as a part of the White Earth Reservation was set aside for allotments in severalty, which were to be made by the United States and accepted by the Indians as their homes. The cession was declared to be for the purposes and on the terms stated in that act, and was to become effective on the President's approval, which was given March 4, 1890. The act provided that the lands so ceded should be surveyed, classified as pine or agricultural, and disposed of at regulated prices, and that the net proceeds should be put into an interest- bearing fund of which the Chippewas were to be the beneficiaries.\n The Mille Lac reservation, although included in the cession of 1863, was again included in the cession under the act of 1889. It was surveyed and opened to settlement and disposal under the public land laws after the cession of 1863; but this led to a controversy with the Indians over the meaning and effect of the clause in the twelfth article of the treaty of 1863, relating to the removal of the Mille Lac band, and that controversy resulted in a suspension of disposals. The controversy continued up to the cession under the act of 1889 and was adjusted and composed in that cession. United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewas, 33 S. Ct. 811, \n229 U.S. 498\n. But after the survey and before the suspension about 700 acres,1 shown by \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 199]\n\u00a0\n the field notes of the survey to be swampy, were patented to the state under the swamp land grant. The patent of May 13, 1871, was for these lands.\n In 1909, under a permissive statute, 35 Stat. 619, c. 126, the Mille Lac band brought a suit against the United States in the Court of Claims to recover for 'losses sustained by them or the Chippewas of Minnesota' by reason of the opening of the Mille Lac Reservation to settlement and disposal. In that suit recovery was sought in respect of all lands in that reservation which the United States had disposed of otherwise than under and in conformity with the act of 1889, including those patented to the state as swamp lands May 13, 1871. Evidence was introduced showing the lands so patented and their value, and one of the questions discussed in the briefs and pressed for decision at the final hearing was whether the Indians were entitled to recover in respect of the lands in that patent, or were precluded therefrom by a provision in the act of 1889, as accepted by the Indians, which the United States insisted had operated to confirm the state's claim under the patent. By the ultimate findings and judgment that controversy was resolved against the Indians and in favor of the United States. 51 Ct. Cl. 400. No appeal was taken from that judgment and it became final. It awarded about $700,000 to the Indians on account of the disposal of other lands, held not within the confirmatory provision, and the award was paid by putting the money in the Chippewa fund before mentioned. 39 Stat. 823, c. 464. Of course, the United States is without right to any recovery here in respect of the lands as to which it was adjudged there to be free from any obligation or responsibility to the Indians. So the lands in the patent of May 13, 1871, need not be considered further.\n The other reservations were surveyed after the cession under the act of 1889. The field notes of the survey \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 200]\n\u00a0\n showed some of the lands to be swampy, and 152,124.18 acres so shown were patented to the state under the swamp land grant. They are the lands for which patents were issued from May 17, 1900, to June 10, 1912. Of these lands 706 acres were within the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as defined and existing in 1860, when the swamp land grant was extended to the state, and the others are lands which had been ceded by the treaty of 1855 and were public lands in 1860.\n In the brief on behalf of the United States an effort is made to overcome the cession in the treaty of 1855 by inviting attention to particular statements in correspondence and other papers of that period and arguing therefrom that the treaty was hastily negotiated with chiefs and warriors, not fairly representative of the bands affected, who were brought to Washington for the purpose and were there subjected to influences and pressure which prevented them from exercising a free judgment and adequately portraying and protecting the interests of such bands. But we think the argument is without any real basis in fact. The inferences sought to be drawn from the statements to which attention is invited are refuted rather than supported by the papers as a whole. While it appears that there was some dissatisfaction with the original selection of those who were to represent the Indians, it also appears that other chiefs and warriors representing the Indians who were dissatisfied were sent to Washington by the local superintendent of Indian affairs and that they actively participated in the negotiations and signed the treaty. The negotiations occupied ten sessions spread over a period of seven days and were reported. The reports indicate that the Indians who participated ably and loyally represented all the bands and spoke for them openly and with effect. Indeed, they persuaded the representatives of the United States to make concessions advantageous to all the bands which were \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 201]\n\u00a0\n much more favorable than those first proposed. They included headchiefs, subchiefs and warriors, 16 in all. Several had represented these Chippewas in making earlier treaties, and afterwards came to represent them in making others.\n But, while the earnestness of counsel has induced us to examine the basis of the argument advanced, there is another reason why the effort to overcome the cession must fail. Under the Constitution the treaty-making power resides in the President and Senate, and when through their action a treaty is made and proclaimed it becomes a law of the United States, and the courts can no more go behind it for the purpose of annuling it in whole or in part than they can go behind an act of Congress. Among the cases applying and enforcing this rule some are particularly in point here. In United States v. Brooks, 10 How. 442, where a grant made to certain individuals by the Caddo Indians in a treaty between them and the United States was assailed by the United States as induced by fraud practiced on the Indians, the court held that 'the influences which were used to secure' the grant could not be made the subject of judicial inquiry for the purpose of overthrowing the treaty provision making it. In Doe v. Braden, 16 How. 635, a provision in the treaty whereby Spain ceded Florida to the United States which annulled a prior grant to the Duke of Alagon was assailed as invalid on the ground that the king, who made the treaty, was without power under the Spanish constitution to annul the grant. But the court refused to go behind the treaty and inquire into the authority of the king under the law of Spain- and this because, as was explained in the decision, it was for the President and Senate to determine who should be recognized as empowered to represent and speak for Spain in the negotiation and execution of the treaty, and as they had recognized the king as possessing that power it was \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 202]\n\u00a0\n not within the province of the courts to inquire whether they had erred in that regard. And in Fellows v. Blacksmith, 19 How. 366, 372, where a treaty with the New York Indians was asserted to be invalid on the ground that the Tonawanda band of Senecas was not represented in the negotiation and signing of the treaty, the court disposed of that assertion by saying:\n'But the answer to this is that the treaty, after executed and ratified by the proper authorities of the government, becomes the supreme law of the land, and the courts can no more go behind it for the purpose of annulling its effect and operation than they can go behind an act of Congress.'\n\n The propriety of this rule and the need for adhering to it are well illsutrated in the present case, where the assault on the treaty cession is made 70 years after the treaty and 40 years after the last installment of the stipulated compensation of approximately $1,200,000 was paid to the Indians.\n By the Act of September 28, 1850, Congress granted to the several states the whole of the swamp lands therein then remaining unsold. 9 Stat. 519, c. 84 (Comp. St. ss 4958-4960). The first section was in the usual terms of a grant in presenti, its words being that the lands described 'shall be, and the same are hereby, granted.' The second section charged the Secretary of the Interior with the duty of making out and transmitting to the Governor of the state accurate lists and plats of the lands described, and of causing patents to issue at the Governor's request, and it then declared that on the issue of the patent the fee simple to the lands should vest in the state. The third section directed that, in making out the lists and plats, all legal subdivisions the greater part of which was wet and unfit for cultivation should be included, but where the greater part was not of that character the whole should be excluded. The question soon arose whether, in view of the terms of the first and second sections, the grant was in praesenti \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 203]\n\u00a0\n and took effect on the date of the act, or rested in promise until the issue of the patent and took effect then. The then Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Stuart, concluded that the grant was in praesenti in the sense that the state became immediately invested with an inchoate title which would become perfect, as of the date of the act, when the land was identified and the patent issued. 1 Lester's Land Laws, 549. That conclusion was accepted by his successors, was approved by the Attorney General (9 Op. Attys. Gen. 253), was adopted by the courts of last resort in the states affected, and was sustained by this court in many cases. ( French v. Fyan, \n93 U.S. 169\n, 170; Wright v. Roseberry, 7 S. Ct. 985, \n121 U.S. 488\n, 500 et seq.; Rogers Locomotive Works v. Emigrant Co., 17 S. Ct. 188, \n164 U.S. 559\n, 570; Work v. Louisiana, 46 S. Ct. 92, \n269 U.S. 250\n). A case of special interest here is Rice v. Sioux City & St. Paul R. R. Co., 4 S. Ct. 177, \n110 U.S. 695\n. The question there was whether the act of 1850 operated, when Minnesota became a state in 1858, to grant to her the swamp lands therein. The court answered in the negative, saying that the act of 1850 'operated as a grant in praesenti to the states then in existence'; that it 'was to operate upon existing things, and with reference to an existing state of facts'; that it 'was to take effect at once, between an existing grantor and several separate existing grantees'; and that, as Minnesota was not then a state, the act made no grant to her.\n By the Act of March 12, 1860, c. 5, 12 Stat. 3, Congress extended the act of 1850 to the new states of Minnesota and Oregon; the material terms of the extending act being as follows:\n'That the provisions of the act (of 1850) be, and the same are hereby, extended to the states of Minnesota and Oregon: Provided, that the grant hereby made shall not include any lands which the government of the United States may have reserved, sold, or disposed of (in pursuance of any law heretofore enacted) prior to the con- \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 204]\n\u00a0\n firmation of title to be made under the authority of the said act.\n\n'Sec. 2. That the selection to be made from lands already surveyed in each of the states including Minnesota and Oregon, under the authority of the act aforesaid, ... shall be made within two years from the adjournment of the Legislature of each state at its next session after the date of this act; and, as to all lands hereafter to be surveyed, within two years from such adjournment, at the next session, after notice by the Secretary of the Interior to the Governor of the state, that the surveys have been completed and confirmed.' (Comp. St. s 4965).\n\n The words 'be, and the same hereby are, extended,' in the principal provision, and the words 'the grant hereby made,' in the proviso, signify an immediate extension to these new states of the grant in praesenti made to other states in 1850. Other parts of the proviso signify an exclusion of particular lands from the grant as extended, but not a change in its nature. Indeed, if the grant as extended were regarded as taking effect only on the issue of the patent, the proviso would be practically an idle provision; while if the grant be regarded as in praesenti, like the original, the proviso serves a real purpose. Of course, the principal provision and the proviso are to be read together and taken according to their natural import, if that be reasonably possible-and we think it is. Thus understood, they show that Congress, while willing and intending to extend to these new states the grant in praesenti made to other states in 1850, was solicitous that the reservation, sale, and disposal of lands ( pursuant to laws in existence at the date of the extension) should not be interrupted or affected pending the identification and patenting of lands under the grant, and that the proviso was adopted for the purpose of excluding from the grant as extended all lands which might be reserved, sold, or disposed of (in pursuance of any law \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 205]\n\u00a0\n theretofore enacted) prior to the confirmation of title under the grant- the confirmation being the issue of patent. Many acts of that period granting lands in words importing a present grant-where the lands were to be afterwards identified under prescribed directions-contained provisions excluding lands that might be disposed of in specified ways before the identification was effected. But those provisions never were regarded as doing more than excepting particular lands from the grants, and, unless there were other provisions restraining the words of present grant, the grants uniformly were held to be in praesenti, in the sense that the title, although imperfect before the identification of the lands, became perfect when the identification was effected and by relation took effect as of the date of the granting act, except as to the tracts failing within the excluding provision.

Harriman, 21 Wall. 44, 60-62.\n The act of 1860 was construed as we here construe it by Secretary Delano in 1874 (1 Copp's P. L. L. 475), and by Secretary Schurz in 1877 (2 Copp. 1081); and their construction was adopted and applied by their successors up to the time of this suit,2 and was approved by the Attorney General in 1906, 25 Op. Atty. Gen. 626. So, even if there were some uncertainty in the act, we should regard this long-continued and uniform practice of the officers charged with the duty of administering it as persuasively determinative of its construction.

Ct. 685, \n233 U.S. 613\n, 627. \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 206]\n\u00a0\n While the grant as extended to Minnesota was a grant in praesenti, it was restricted to lands which were then public. The restriction was not expressed, but implied according to a familiar rule. That rule is that lands which have been appropriated or reserved for a lawful purpose are not public, and are to be regarded as impliedly excepted from subsequent laws, grants, and disposals which do not specially disclose a purpose to include them. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 513; Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston R. R. Co. v. United States, \n92 \nU.S. 733, 741\n, 745 S.; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Roberts, 14 S. Ct. 496, \n152 U.S. 114\n, 119; Scott v. Carew, 25 S. Ct. 193, \n196 U.S. 100\n. Thus the general words of the acts of 1850 and 1860 must be read as subject to such an exception Louisiana v. Garfield, supra, page 77 (29 S. Ct. 31).\n The 706 acres, before described as within the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as originally created, were not public lands when the grant was extended to the state, but were then reserved and appropriated for the use of the Chippewas, and so were excepted from the grant. Probably the patenting of them to the state was a mere inadvertence, for it was not in accord with rulings of the Secretary of the Interior on the subject. But, be that as it may, the patenting was contrary to law and in derogation of the rights of the Indians under the act of 1889. Therefore the United States is entitled to a cancellation of the patents as to these lands, uness the state has sold the lands, and in that event is entitled to recover their value.\n The 152,124.18 acres, before described as within the cession of 1855, were not reserved or otherwise appropriated when the grant was extended, but were then public lands; and, being swampy in character, they were included in the grant and rightly patented under it, unless there be merit in some of the contentions of the part of the United States which remain to be considered. \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 207]\n\u00a0\n It is said that these lands, although public when the grant was extended, were afterwards reserved and appropriated for the use of the Chippewas by treaties made before the title under the grant was confirmed by the issue of patents, and that this brought the lands within the exception made by the proviso. The contention appears to be in direct conflict with the words of the proviso which limit the exception made therein to lands reserved, sold or disposed of in pursuance of laws enacted before the grant was extended. But, by way of avoiding this conflict, it is said that the treaties were made in the exercise of a power conferred by the Constitution, which is a law adopted before the extension, and therefore that the lands must be held to have been reserved and appropriated in pursuance of a prior law in the sense of the proviso. We assent to the premise, but not to the conclusion. The words of the proviso are 'in pursuance of any law heretofore enacted.' We do not doubt that, rightly understood, they include a prior treaty as well as a prior statute. But we think it would be a perversion of both their natural import and their spirit to hold that they include either a subsequent treaties subsequent statute. Of course, all treaties and statutes of the United States are based on the Constitution; and in a remote sense what is done by or under them is done under it. But lands are never reserved, sold or disposed of directly under the Constitution, but only in pursuance of treaties made or statutes enacted under it. The words 'heretofore enacted,' in the proviso, are words of limitation and cannot be disregarded. They show that it is not intended to have the same meaning as it if said, 'in pursuance of any law,' and that what it means is any treaty or statute theretofore made or enacted.\n It next is said-assuming the grant was in praesenti and included these lands-that in virtue of the treaty-making power the United States could, and did by the \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 208]\n\u00a0\n treatles of 1863, 1865, and 1867, divest the state of her right in the lands and appropriate them to the use and benefit of the Chippewas. The decisions of this Court generally have regarded treaties as on much the same plane as acts of Congress, and as usually subject to the general limitations in the Constitution; but there has been no decision on the question sought to be presented here. The case of Rice v. Minnesota & Northwestern R. R. Co., 1 Black, 358, is cited as giving some color to the contention; but in so far as it has a bearing it tends the other way. The controversy there was over the validity of an act of Congress repealing a prior act making a grant of lands to the then territory of Minnesota in aid of the construction of a proposed railroad. The granting act, while containing words of present grant, declared that 'no title' should pass to the territory until a designated portion of the road was completed, and also that the lands should not inure to the benefit of any company constituted and organized prior to the date of that act. The territory, anticipating a grant in aid of the undertaking, already had attempted to transfer her rights under the grant to a company incorporated theretofore; and the litigation was with that company. The repealing act was passed less than two months after the granting act and before the construction of the road was begun. The court held that the grant was not in praesenti, because the words of present grant were fully overcome by other provisions; and also that the repealing act was valid, because no right had passed to the territory or the company up to that time. But the court deemed it proper to say (page 373) that if the granting act had passed a present right, title or interest in the lands, the repealing act would be 'void, and of no effect,' and also (page 374) that if the granting act had operated to give to the territory a beneficial interest in the lands, it was 'clear that it was not competent for Congress to pass the repealing act and divest the title.' \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 209]\n\u00a0\n But if the treaty-making power be as far reaching as is contended- which we are not now prepared to hold-we are of opinion that no treaty should be construed as intended to divest rights of property-such as the state possessed in respect of these lands-unless the purpose so to do be shown in the treaty with such certainty as to put it beyond reasonable question. And, of course, the rule before stated, that where lands have been appropriated for a lawful purpose they are to be regarded as impliedly excepted from subsequent disposals which do not specially include them, applies to treaty disposals as well as to statutory disposals.\n On examining the treaties we do not find anything in them which may be said to be certainly indicative of a purpose to divest the state of her right to these lands. The areas reserved by the treaties were described in general terms-as by indicating the exterior boundaries or designating the area as a stated number of townships around a particular lake. The area were very large-one comprising more than a million acres. No doubt the descriptions were sufficient to carry the whole of each area, if free from other claims; but there was nothing in them or in the other provisions signifying a purpose to disturb prior disposals or to extinguish existing rights under them. True, it was said that the reservations were established as 'future homes' for the Indians; but this meant that the Indians were to live within the reservations, and did not have reference to any particular lands within their limits. The areas were vastly in excess of what would be needed for individual homes and farms, and included many lands wholly unfit for that purpose. The areas were dotted with lakes-some navigable-and with swamps-some almost impassable. In short, it is apparent that the treaties dealt with extensive areas in a general way and not with particular lands in a specific way. So we think they must be read as impliedly ex- \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 210]\n\u00a0\n cepting the swamp lands theretofore granted to the state and leaving her right to them undisturbed.\n The case of Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 22 S. Ct. 650, \n185 U.S. 373\n, is cited as making for a different conclusion; but it does not do so. The question there was whether the state was entitled, under the school land grant, to sections 16 and 36 in the part of the Red Lake Reservation which was ceded under the act of 1889. That grant was expressed in words of promise, not of present grant. Title was to pass when the lands were identified by survey, if they were then public; and if at that time they were not public but otherwise disposed of, the state was to be entitled to other lands in their stead. The lands in question never had been public; and their cession under the act of 1889 was not absolute or unqualified but in trust that they be sold as provided in that act for the benefit of the Indians. After that cession the lands in the ceded part of the reservation were surveyed and the government officers took up the task of selling them in pursuance of the trust. The state then sued to establish her claim to sections 16 and 36 and to prevent their sale. The court ruled against the state, and the following excerpt from the opinion ( page 393 (22 S. Ct. 658)) discloses the grounds on which the decision proceeded:\n'Congress does not, by the section making the school land grant, either in letter or spirit, bind itself to remove all burdens which may rest upon lands belonging to the government within the state, or to transform all from their existing status to that of public lands, strictly so called, in order that the school grant may operate upon the sections named. It is, of course, to be presumed that Congress will act in good faith; that it will not attempt to impair the scope of the school grant; that it intends that the state shall receive the particular sections or their equivalent in aid of its public school system. But considerations may arise which will justify an appropriation \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 211]\n\u00a0\n of a body of lands within the state to other purposes, and if those lands have never become public lands the power of Congress to deal with them is not restricted by the school grant, and the state must seek relief in the clause which gives it equivalent sections.'\n\n It further is said that, assuming the state was entitled to these lands, she lost her right by failing to make selection of them within the prescribed period after they were surveyed. There is no merit in this contention. It rests on a misconception of what constitutes a selection in the sense of the requirement in the second section of the act of 1860, before quoted. The earlier statute of 1850, in its second section, charged the Secretary of the Interior with the duty of making out and transmitting to each state accurate lists of the lands falling within the grant; and to do this it was necessary that he determine which lands were swampy and which were not swampy. The act said nothing about the evidence on which his determination should be based or the mode of obtaining the evidence. In taking up the administration of the grant, the Secretary accorded to each state a choice between two propositions: First, whether she would abide by the showing in the government surveyor's field notes; and, second, if the first proposition was not accepted, whether she would through her own agents make an examination in the field and present claims for the lands believed to be swampy accompanied by proof of their character. Some of the states elected to abide by the surveyor's field notes and others elected to take the other course. In the administration of the grant these elections were respected and given effect, save as there were some merely temporary departures. Where the election was to abide by the field notes that, without more, was regarded a continuing selection by the state of all lands thus shown to be swampy. Where the election was to take the other course the presentation of claims with supporting proofs was \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 212]\n\u00a0\n regarded as a selection by the state. This was the settled practice when the act of 1860 was passed; and the provision in its second section requiring that selection be made within a designated period is to be construed in the light of that practice. Neither that act nor the one of 1850 contained any other provision which reasonably could be said to require a selection by the state. Possibly the provision in the second section of the act of 1850 requiring the Secretary to make out and transmit to each state accurate lists of the lands falling within the grant might be said to lay on him a duty to make selections. But, if this was the selection meant by the second section of the act of 1860, the states could not be charged with any dereliction or neglect by reason of his delay. But we think it meant a selection by the state as that term was understood in the administrative practice. There had been objectionable delay prior to the act of 1860 on the part of some of the states in carrying out their election to make examinations in the field and present claims with supporting proof, and the second section of that act shows that it was specially directed against unnecessary delay in making that kind of selections. It evidently was intended to accord to those states reasonable opportunity for making necessary appropriations and to require that they then proceed diligently with the examinations in the field and the presentation of their claims and proofs.\n Shortly after the act of 1860 the propositions theretofore submitted to other states were submitted to Minnesota by the Secretary's direction in a letter from the Commissioner of the General Land Office. After stating the propositions the Commissioner said:\n'By the adoption of the first proposition the state will receive all the lands to which she is justly entitled, as the field notes of the survey are very full in characterizing or giving descriptions to the soil; and an important reason for doing so is \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 213]\n\u00a0\n that she will incur no expense in selecting or designating the lands.'\n\n By an act of her Legislature, passed in 1862 (Laws 1862, c. 62), Minnesota elected to abide by the surveyors' field notes, and her Governor promptly notified the Commissioner and the Secretary of that election. It has been respected and given effect, with one temporary interruption, and has been treated as a continuing selection by the state of all lands shown by the surveyor's field notes to be swampy. 2 Copp's P. L. L. 1034; 32 L. D. 65, 533-535. In 1877 Secretary Schurz, in overruling a contention like that we now are considering, held that the action of the state Legislature in 1862, was an effective selection. 2 Copp's P. L. L. 1081. Similar contentions were pronounced untenable by the Attorney General in 1906 (25 Op. Attys. Gen. 626), and by the Secretary of the Interior in 1909 (37 L. D. 397). On principle, as also out of due regard for the administrative practice, we think the election by the state Legislature, approved by the Governor as it was, was a timely and continuing compliance with the requirement in the second section of the act of 1860. What would have been the effect of a failure to comply with that requirement we need not consider here.\n The further contention is made that the state before the issue of the patents forfeited her right to receive them by disabling herself, through an amendment to her Constitution, from complying with the provision in the act of 1850 directing that the lands passing to the state under the grant, or the proceeds of their sale, 'be applied, exclusively, as far as necessary,' in effecting their reclamation by means of needed levees and ditches. The state did declare in an amendment to her Constitution, adopted in 1881, that the lands should be sold and the proceeds inviolably devoted to the support and maintenance of public schools and educational institutions; but it does not follow that she disabled herself from reclaiming the lands or formed or declared a purpose not to re- \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 214]\n\u00a0\n claim them. On the contrary, her statutes enacted since the amendment and the published reports of her officers show that she adopted and proceeded to carry out extensive reclamation plans applicable to all swamp lands within her limits, that she and her municipal subdivisions expended many millions of dollars in this work, and that they are still proceeding with it. But, apart from this, the contention must fail. It rests on an erroneous conception of the effect and operation of the provision relied on, as is shown in repeated decisions of this court. We think it enough to refer to United States v. Louisiana, 8 S. Ct. 1047, \n127 U.S. 182\n, for the controversy there was between the United States, the grantor, and one of the stated to which the grant was made. The court cited and reviewed the earlier cases and then said (page 191 (8 S. Ct. 1052)):\n'Under the act of 1850, the swamp lands are to be conveyed to the state as an absolute gift, with a direction that their proceeds shall be applied exclusively, as far as necessary, to the purpose of reclaiming the lands. The judgment of the state as to the necessity is paramount, and any application of the proceeds by the state to any other object is to be taken as the declaration of its judgment that the application of the proceeds to the reclamation of the lands is not necessary.'\n\n And also (page 192 (8 S. Ct. 1052)):\n'If the power exists anywhere to enforce any provisions attached to the grant, it resides in Congress, and not in the court.'\n\n The same principles have been applied in later and related cases. Stearns v. Minnesota, 21 S. Ct. 73, \n179 U.S. 223\n, 231; Alabama v. Schmidt, 34 S. Ct. 301, \n232 U.S. 168\n; King County v. Seattle School District, 44 S. Ct. 127, \n263 U.S. 361\n, 364.\n Finally much stress is laid on the provisions of the act of 1889, the cession under it, and resulting rights of the Indians and obligations of the United States. But it suffices here to say that the act of 1889 was without application to lands in which the Indians had no interest, that the cession under it was only of lands in which they had \n\n[270 U.S. 181, 215]\n\u00a0\n an interest, and that the resulting rights of the Indians and obligations of the United States were limited accordingly.\n Our conclusion on the whole case is that the bill must be dismissed on the merits as to all the lands, excepting the 706 acres described as within the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as defined and existing in 1860, and that as to them the United States is entitled to a decree canceling the patents for such as have not been sold by the state and charging her with the value of such as she has sold. By reason of the relation in which the United States is suing, the value should be determined on the basis of the prices which would have been controlling had the particular lands been dealt with, as they should have been, under the act of 1889.

Ed. 811).\n The parties will be accorded 20 days within which to suggest a form of decree giving effect to our conclusions and to present an agreed calculation of the value of so much of the 706 acres as has been sold. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This may include one or two small subdivisions which had been patented theretofore to a Mille Lac chief, Shaw-vosh-kung, under the first article of the treaty of 1865. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 3 Land Dec. 474, 476; 22 Land Dec. 388; 27 Land Dec. 418; 32 Land Dec. 65, 328; 37 Land Dec. 397. \n\n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUIHLEIN v.

Solicitor General Mitchell, of Washington, D. C., and Assistant Attorney General Galloway, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant sued the United States in the Court of Claims for $30, 697.73, for breach of a contract made by it with the United States for certain construction work at the government nitrate plant No. 2 at Muscle Shoals, \n\n[271 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n Ala. The work was done and the contract price paid. The amount here sued for was made up of nine claims for damages for breaches and extras. The Court of Claims found against the claimant on every cause of action alleged. Appeal to this court relates to only two of them.\n The first is for $3,059.65, and is based on the alleged failure of the United States to furnish a right of way as stipulated in the contract for use in hauling materials to the place of construction.\n After providing that the contractor should furnish certain materials for construction, the contract read:\n'The United States of America to furnish at its present location on the reservation at United States nitrate plant No. 2 all other construction materials, the contractor to perform all necessary labor required in transporting such materials to the proper place of for use in construction, the United States of America at all times to furnish the necessary right of way for ingress and egress to the place of present storage of such materials and the place of ultimate use in construction.\n\n'The United States government further agrees to furnish to the contractor for the purpose of transporting materials and performing the necessary construction work, such tools and equipment including locomotives, flat cars, dump cars, hoisting engines, locomotive cranes, steam shovels, concrete mixers, air compressors, automobile trucks, clam shell buckets, etc., as are now the property of the United States government and available at United States nitrate plant No. 2, and in such quantities as in the discretion of the constructing quartermaster may be reasonably necessary for such use in construction, and further may be reasonably furnished by the United States government, without material detriment or inconvenience to the United States government. The contractor to accept such equipment as is, and to assume all responsibility \n\n[271 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n for placing such equipment in first-class working condition, and the proper care and maintenance of such equipment, from the time it is turned over to him by the constructing quartermaster.'\n\n Finding No. 2 by the court is:\n'The right of way furnished by the United States consisted of railroad tracks running from the site of the work to the storage yards. These tracks were used by others, and were not in good condition when the plaintiff submitted its bid, nor were they in any worse condition when it began its work under the contract. The United States did not keep the tracks in good condition during the performance of the contract, but turned them over to the plaintiff for its use with the necessary rolling stock. The plaintiff expended the sum of $705.50 for labor in repairing the tracks and $700.66 for making repairs to equipment damaged by reason of the defective tracks; it also expended the further sum of $1,653.49 for labor in connection with derailments.'\n\n What the government agreed to furnish was a right of way, not a railroad for transportation. It agreed that ingress and egress by this right of way should, at all times during the performance of the contract, be given the contractor, and such ingress and egress were afforded it. The defective track on the right of way was evident to the contractor when it made the contract, and the reasonable construction of the contract is that the contractor, in order to avail itself of the right of way, with constant ingress and egress, took over the track as it was as part of the equipment for transportation, just as he did the locomotive and cars, and as it found it, with sole responsibility for placing it in working condition and maintaining it for its use. It is clear that the Court of Claims was right in rejecting this claim.\n The other claim was for damages for delay by the government in arranging for the contractor's start upon the \n\n[271 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n work. The contract provided that the work should be commenced on June 10, 1920, and by that time the contractor had its executive office force at the plant. The contractor was able to begin work on June 13. The delay resulted from the inability to get material issued to the contractor. The actual amount expended for salary and services to the persons kept waiting was $360. No complaint and no protest were made by the contractor at the time, and no claim was filed by the contractor until March 14, 1921. The holding of the Court of Claims was that, because it did not satisfactorily appear that the delay was due wholly to the government, and in view of the absence of a claim or protest for nine months thereafter, the claim should be rejected. We concur in this.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES EX REL. HUGHES v.

St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), in the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Ohio. He appeared, upon notice, before a commissioner of Ottumwa, Iowa, and after a hearing he was ordered to be held for removal. Rev. Stat.  1014 (Comp. St.  1674). The relator thereupon applied to the judges of the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that the indictment was band and that the Commissioner rejected evidence that the relator was innocent and that therefore there was no probable cause to \n\n[271 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n believe him guilty of a crime in Ohio. He also prayed for a writ of certiorari to bring the proceedings below before the Court. The writs were issued and after a hearing the District Court denied the relator his discharge and directed an order of removal to be prepared. The relator appeals under section 238 of the Judicial Code, Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157 (Comp. St.  1215), before the Act of February, 13, 1925, c. 229 (43 Stat. 938), went into effect. The grounds alleged are that by the refusal to hold that the indictment did not show probable cause to believe the relator guilty and that by the exclusion of the evidence the relator was deprived of his right to be tried in the District wherein the crime was committed, Constitution, art. 3,  2, and Amendment 6, and that he was detained without due process of law. Amendment 5.\n The Constitution does not require any preliminary hearing before a person charged with a crime against the United States is brought into the Court having jurisdiction of the charge. There he may deny the jurisdiction of the Court as he may deny his guilt, and the Constitution is satisfied by his right to contest it there. With immaterial exceptions any one in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and may be required to stand trial wherever he is alleged to have committed the crime. In Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 27 S. Ct. 430, the conclusion is not that the appellant by being denied the right to present any evidence was deprived of his rights under the Constitution, but that he was denied 'a right secured by statute under the Constitution.'\n As that instrument does not provide for bringing the accused into the power of the Court authorized to try him, a statute was necessary and is found in Rev. Stat.  1014. This might have been interpreted as contemplating a summary order without other hearing than was necessary, when there was an indictment, to show that fact and that the person present was the person charged. \n\n[271 U.S. 142, 150]\n\u00a0\n The hardship of removal, however, has grown with the growth of the United States, and there is a natural desire to prevent it when possible, if a preliminary sifting will show that there is no probable cause for the charge. Accordingly it is held that the District Judge on application to remove acts judicially and that probable cause must be shown. Beavers v. Henkel, \n194 \nU.S. 73, 83\n, 24 S. Ct. 605; Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 \nU.S. 20, 27\n, 29 S., 32, 27 S. Ct. 430. It is to be noticed however that 'where any offender ... is committed in any district other than that where the offense is to be tried. it shall be the duty of the judge of the district where such offender ... is imprisoned, seasonably to issue, and of the marshal to execute, a warrant for his removal,' etc. But the commitment, supposed by these words already to have taken place, is entrusted not only to judges and commissioners of the United States, and judges of state courts, but to any 'mayor of a city, justice of the peace, or other magistrate, of any State where he may be found.' Obviously, in order to make it the duty of the judge to issue the warrant a mayor or a magistrate not a lawyer cannot be expected to do more than to decide in a summary way that the indictment is intended to charge an offense against the laws of the United States, that the person before him is the person charged and that there is probable cause to believe him guilty, without the magistrate's being held to more than avoiding palpable injustice. He is not intended to hold a preliminary trial and if probable cause is shown on the government side, he is not to set it aside because on the other evidence he believes the defendant innocent. The rule that would apply to a mayor applies to a commissioner of the United States.\n The relator testified before the Commissioner both in general terms and in detail that he and his company were innocent. The Commissioner excluded further details from him confirmatory of what he had sworn and evi- \n\n[271 U.S. 142, 151]\n\u00a0\n dence of customers that they were acquired in the way of competitive trade, seemingly on the ground that they would not or at least might not know that they were held as customers because of an agreement among the defendants, and also on the ground that he was not called on to listen to merely defensive proof: an opinion that he expressed. On a summary proceeding like this even if the exclusion was wrong it would not be enough to invalidate the order of removal, as the Commissioner indicated by his finding that he thought there were substantial grounds for the charge of guilt and that it was not for him to decide whether they were met by the denials of the defendant even if they seemed convincing. Collins v. Loisel, \n259 \nU.S. 309, 314\n, 315 S., 42 S. Ct. 469.\n We do not regard the attack upon the indictment as needing discussion. It has been upheld by a number of District Courts and by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as sufficient for removal purposes. It alleges that the Iowa Malleable Iron Company under the charge of the relator was party to an agreement to eliminate competition in interstate trade and to fix excessive and noncompetitive prices and that the company and the relator are engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade among the States. The relator is not left in doubt of the effort of the grand jury to present him as criminal under the Sherman Act.\n It is pointed out in Beavers v. Henkel, \n194 \nU.S. 73, 83\n, 24 S. Ct. 605, that there are much stronger reasons for caution in surrendering an alleged criminal to a foreign nation than are required before removing a citizen from one place to another within the jurisdiction, yet in the latest case on extradition it is said that 'habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate had jurisdiction, whether the offense charged is within the treaty and, by a somewhat liberal extension, whether there was any \n\n[271 U.S. 142, 152]\n\u00a0\n evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.' Fernadez v. Phillips, \n268 \nU.S. 311, 312\n, 45 S. Ct. 541, 542 (69 L. Ed. 970). So far as the attack upon the order of removal is by habeas corpus this would seem to apply. Price v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 30 S. Ct. 257.\n But to recur to what we intimated at the beginning, the requirements of the statute, be they greater or less, are not requirements of the Constitution but only in aid of the Constitution, made, in rather a remote sense, 'in order that any one accused shall not be deprived of this constitutional right' to be tried in the District wherein the crime shall have been committed. \n205 U.S. 32\n (27 S.

The relator's contention that he has been deprived of constitutional rights fails.\n If follows that the order of the District Court must be affirmed.\n Order affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS is of the opinion that, by refusing to hear and to consider evidence introduced or offered which bore upon the existence of probable cause, the commissioner did not merely commit error, but deprived the petitioner of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because he was denied a fair hearing.

From judgments in their favor the government brings the cases to this court on appeal. Judicial Code,  242 (Comp. St.  1219), before amendment of 1925\n\n\n For the purpose of discussing the main question raised by both appeals, No. 420 will first be considered, and such \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 435]\n\u00a0\n additional questions as are involved in No. 337 will then be taken up.\n The appellee, Yale & Towne Manufacturing Company, a Connecticut corporation, was, in 1916, engaged in the manufacture of munitions. The tax imposed by the United States on the profits on munitions manufactured by it and sold during that year, became due and was paid in 1917. In making its return for income tax for the year 1917, the appellee deducted from its gross income the amount of the munitions tax thus paid. Later the Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that the munitions tax paid in 1917 should have been deducted from the appellee's gross income in its return for 1916. There was in consequence an adjustment of the income taxes payable in those years, resulting in a net increase of the tax payable for the year 1917 of $116,044.40, which was assessed and paid under protest and is the amount for which suit was brought.\n The correctness of the determination of the Commissioner depends upon the construction of the Revenue Act of 1916 and its application to the particular method employed by the taxpayer in keeping its books of account and in making return for income tax for 1916. The pertinent provisions of the statute are sections 10, 12(a), 13(a) and (d), and 300 of the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463 (39 Stat. 756, 765, 767, 768, 770, 771, 780, 781 (Comp. St.  6336j, 6336l, 6336m, 6336 1\/4 a)). The act imposes a tax on net income and profits ascertained as provided by section 12(a), by deducting from gross income, expenses paid, losses sustained, interest and taxes paid during the calendar year. Section 13(d), however, provides that:\n'A corporation ... keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, make its return upon the basis upon which its \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 436]\n\u00a0\n accounts are kept, in which case the tax shall be computed upon its income as so returned. ...'\n\n In the year 1916 the appellee set up on its books of account all the obligations or expenses incurred during the year whether they fell due and whether they were paid during that year. It entered in an account, 'Reserves for Taxes,' items of various kinds of taxes, liability for which was incurred by reason of its operations for that year, whether paid or payable during the year. Included in the reserves for taxes for 1916 were items aggregating $247,763.19 for taxes on profits from the sale of munitions during the year. The return for the munitions tax was made by the appellee in 1917, and the tax, after revision and an additional assessment, was paid in 1917, the year when it was due.\n In making up its income tax return for 1916, appellee deducted from gross income all the items appearing on its books as losses sustained and obligations and expenses incurred during the year, except that it omitted from the return the items of munitions tax, likewise carried on its books, as an obligation or expense incurred or accrued in the year.\n It is urged by the government that the appellee, not having kept its books or made its tax return on the basis of receipts and disbursements, has elected to avail itself of the privilege afforded by section 13(d) of making its return on what was referred to in the briefs and argument as 'the accrual basis'; that, having so elected, it is required consistently to deduct from gross income all items appearing on its books as expenses accruing or incurred during the taxable year, including its reserve for munitions taxes, whether payable or not.\n It is not denied by the appellee that its method of keeping its accounts and setting up a reserve for munitions taxes reflected its true income for 1916 or that its amended return on that basis accurately reflects it income and \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 437]\n\u00a0\n profits for the year. But it contends that the munitions tax was deductible only in 1917 because under the Revenue Act of 1916 only taxes actually paid during the year were deductible in determining net income for the year; and that in any case the provisions of that act and the regulations made by the Commissioner, authorizing the taxpayer to make his returns on an 'accrual' basis if his books are so kept, could have no application to tax deductions, since a tax does not accrue until it is due and payable.\n While section 12(a) taken by itself would appear to require the income tax return to be made on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, it is to be read with section 13(d) which we have quoted and which obviously limits in some respects the operation of section 12(a) by providing in substance that a corporation keeping its books on a basis other than receipts and disbursements, may make its return on that basis provided it is one which reflects income.\n Standing by themselves and taken at their face value, these sections would seem to require the taxpayer to make his return on the basis of receipts and disbursements, or, in the alternative, on the basis of its own books of account if they reflect true income, under such regulations as the Commissioner may make, and indeed to require the latter alternative if the taxpayer is unable to make his return on that basis.\n So interpreting the statute, the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, on January 8, 1917, before appellee made its income tax return for 1916, promulgated Treasury Decision 2433 which provides in part that under section 13(d) it-\n'will be permissible for corporations which accrue on their books monthly or at other stated periods amounts sufficient to meet fixed annual or other charges to deduct from their gross income the amounts so accrued, provided such accruals approximate \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 438]\n\u00a0\n as nearly as possible the actual liabilities for which the accruals are made, and provided that in cases wherein deductions are made on the accrual basis as hereinbefore indicated, income from fixed and determinable sources accruing to the corporations must be returned, for the purpose of the tax, on the same basis.'\n\n It also provided in substance that when the taxpayer, following a consistent accounting practice, sets up reserves to meet liabilities, the 'amount of which or date of maturity' is not definitely determinable, such reserve may be deducted from gross income. The decision also laid down a procedure for readjusting such reserves when the amount actually required for that purpose was definitely ascertained, and provided that if returns upon this basis of 'accrual or reserves' did not reflect true net income, the taxpayer would not be permitted to make its return on any other basis than that of 'actual receipts and disbursements.'\n We think that the statute was correctly interpreted by the Commissioner and that his decision referred to was consistent with its purpose and intent.\n The Revenue Acts of 1909 (36 Stat. 11) and 1913 (38 Stat. 114) authorized a method of computing the income of corporations, which did not differ materially from that provided by section 12(a) of the Act of 1916. They required in terms that net income should be ascertained by deducting from gross income received, interest, expenses and taxes actually paid and losses actually sustained, but contained no provision corresponding to section 13(d) of the Act of 1916 by which a return might be made on the basis of the taxpayer's books of account. Corporation Excise Tax Act Aug. 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112; Corporation Income Tax Act Oct. 3, 1913, c. 16,  II, subd. G, 38 Stat. 114, 172.\n It was pressed upon us in argument by appellees that it was found impracticable to comply strictly with the \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 439]\n\u00a0\n requirements of the 1909 and 1913 acts for computing income on the basis of receipts and disbursements and that under both acts the administrative practice was established, by appropriate Treasury Regulations, permitting the use of inventories and authorizing deduction of expenses constituting a liability of the taxpayer, whether paid or not, in ascertaining net income, but that those regulations did not permit the deduction of taxes except in the year when paid. From this it is argued that Congress, by reenacting in section 12(a) of the Act of 1916 the corresponding provisions of the earlier acts, adopted the settled administrative practice, and that accordingly under that act, as well as under the earlier acts and Treasury Regulations, taxes could be deducted only in the year when paid.\n This argument would have force had Congress stopped with the enactment of section 12(a). By thus adopting, without material change, the corresponding provisions of earlier acts, Congress might have been deemed to have recognized and adopted the established practice of the Department interpreting and applying them. National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140\n, 40 S. Ct. 237. But, in the Act of 1916, Congress added section 13(d), which did not have its counterpart in earlier legislation. This section went further than any previous regulations by authorizing the tax return to be made on the basis on which the taxpayer's books were kept, provided only that the basis was one reflecting income and the return complied with regulations made by the Commissioner.\n Treasury Decision 2433, to which reference has been made, was in harmony with this view of section 13(d). It recognized the right of the corporation to deduct all accruals and reserves, without distinction, made on its books to meet liabilities, provided the return included income accrued, and, as made, reflected true net income. If the return failed so to reflect income, the regulation reserved \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 440]\n\u00a0\n the right of the Commissioner to require the return to be made on the basis of receipts and disbursements.\n A consideration of the difficulties involved in the preparation of an income account on a strict basis of receipts and disbursements for a business of any complexity, which had been experienced in the application of the Acts of 1909 and 1913 and which made it necessary to authorize by departmental regulation, a method of preparing returns not in terms provided for by those statutes, indicates with no uncertainty the purpose of sections 12(a) and 13(d) of the Act of 1916. It was to enable taxpayers to keep their books and make their returns according to scientific accounting principles, by charging against income earned during the taxable period, the expenses incurred in and properly attributable to the process of earning income during that period; and indeed, to require the tax return to be made on that basis, if the taxpayer failed or was unable to make the return on a strict receipts and disbursements basis.\n The appellee's true income for the year 1916 could not have been determined without deducting from its gross income for the year the total cost and expenses attributable to the production of that income during the year. The reserve for munitions taxes set up on its books for 1916 must have been deducted from receivables for munitions sold in that year before the net results of the operations for the year could be ascertained. The taxpayer being unable to make its return on a strict receipts and disbursements basis, and not having attempted to do so, could not have complied with section 13(d) and Treasury Decision 2433 by deducting either accruals of interest or expenses alone without the other, or without deducting other reserves made on its books to meet liabilities such as the munitions tax, incurred in the process of creating income.\n Only a word need be said with reference to the contention that the tax upon munitions manufactured and \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 441]\n\u00a0\n sold in 1916 did not accrue until 1917. In a technical legal sense it may be argued that a tax does not accrue until it has been assessed and becomes due; but it is also true that in advance of the assessment of a tax, all the events may occur which fix the amount of the tax and determine the liability of the taxpayer to pay it. In this respect, for purposes of accounting and of ascertaining true income for a given accounting period, the munitions tax here in question did not stand on any different footing than other accrued expenses appearing on appellee's books. In the economic and bookkeeping sense with which the statute and Treasury decision were concerned, the taxes had accrued. It should be noted that section 13(d) makes no use of the words 'accrue' or 'accrual' but merely provides for a return upon the basis upon which the taxpayer's accounts are kept, if it reflects income-which is precisely the return insisted upon by the government. We do not think that the Treasury Decision contemplated a return on any other basis when it used the terms 'accrued' and 'accrual' and provided for the deduction by the taxpayer of items 'accrued on their books.'\n United States v. Woodward, \n256 \nU.S. 632\n, 41 S. Ct. 615, relied upon by appellees, arose under the Income Tax Law of 1918, c. 18, title 2,  210-214, 219, 1405, 40 Stat. 1062-1067, 1071, 1151 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 e-6336 1\/8 g, 6336 1\/8 ii, 6371 3\/4 c). Section 213(a) and (e) of that act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 ff) provided that taxes 'paid or accrued' within the taxable year imposed by authority of the United States, except income, war profits and excess profits taxes, might be deducted in ascertaining income. The claim of the taxpayer of the right to deduct estate taxes levied under that act for the year when due, although paid in a later year, was upheld. It did not appear whether, as here, the taxpayer kept his books on the accrual basis or whether, as here, events had occurred before the tax became due which fixed the amount of it; for it did not appear \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 442]\n\u00a0\n whether the deductions to be made from the testator's gross estate were ascertainable for the purpose of determining the estate tax. The question which we now have to determine was not raised, considered or decided in that case.\n We conclude that the reserves for taxes which appeared on appellee's books in 1916 were deductible under section 13(d) of the Act of 1916 and Treasury Decision 2433 in its income tax return on the accrual basis for that year.\n It was argued in behalf of the appellees in No. 337 that the taxpayer did not keep its books on an accrual basis; that consequently its case was not controlled by section 13(d) and Treasury Regulations made under it, and that by section 12(a) it was authorized to deduct the amount assessed for munitions taxes only in 1917, the year when paid. On this point we are concluded by the findings. They show that in the year 1916 the taxpayer accrued on its books expenses, whether paid or not, including 'insurance reserves,' 'freight reserves,' 'bonus reserves,' and depreciation charged off, aggregating more than $2,500,000, which it deducted from accrued gross income, whether actually received or not, in making its income tax return for the year. It charged on its books and deducted in its income tax return, interest accrued and paid during the year. So far as appears no other interest accrued during the year and there was no reserve for interest. No charge or deduction was made for bad debts. It also set up on its books for that year a monthly reserve of $35,000 for the payment of munitions taxes beginning with September, the month of the passage of the Revenue Act of 1916 taxing munitions. On December 31, 1916, this reserve account was closed out and a charge was made on its books against the corporate surplus for account of munitions taxes of $86,541.95. No deduction was made by the taxpayer for munitions taxes in its income tax return for the year 1916. In 1917 the \n\n[269 U.S. 422, 443]\n\u00a0\n munitions tax was returned and ultimately assessed and paid in the sum of $ 112,419.54.\n Since the suit was one to recover a tax erroneously exacted, the burden was on the petitioners, appellees here, to prove the facts establishing the invalidity of the tax. But the findings fail to show affirmatively that the books were kept or the return made on the basis of receipts and disbursements. Indeed, the facts found, to which we have referred, show that the books were kept on the basis of accruals and reserves to meet liabilities incurred. It does not appear that there was any expense or liability of the taxpayer incurred by its operations during the year which was not accrued on its books. Its return was made on that basis, but omitted munitions taxes accrued on its books during the year for which the return was made. We think these facts bring the case clearly within the principle which we deem to be applicable to No. 420.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims in each case is reversed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice SANFORD dissent. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

St.  8820 et seq.), and were found guilty by a jury. The Cir- \n\n[272 U.S. 549, 551]\n\u00a0\n cuit Court of Appeals reviewed and reversed the judgment of conviction upon the sole ground of fatal variance between allegation and proof, or failure of proof to support the charge. 6 F.(2d) 98. They said:\n'The indictment charged defendants with 'combining or conspiring to prevent manufacturing plants located outside of the city of Chicago and in other states than Illinois from selling and delivering their building material in and shipping the same to said city of Chicago.' ... The proof, however, disclosed merely an agreement between defendants whereby union defendants were not to work upon nonunion-made millwork. ... The agreement which the defendants entered into merely dealt with millwork which was the product of nonunion labor. It mattered not where the millwork was produced, whether in or outside of Illinois, if it bore the union label. The restriction was not against the shipment of millwork into Illinois. It was against nonunion-made millwork produced in or out of Illinois. We find no evidence which would support a finding that the agreement embodied in article 3 of section 3 was not the real agreement of the parties. Wherefore we conclude there is a fatal variance, and the evidence does not sustain the indictment.'\n\n They considered no other objection to the judgment of conviction, and the cause came here by certiorari, because that point seemed to require further examination. We think it was wrongly decided.\n The challenged combination and agreement related to the manufacture and installation in the city of Chicago of building material commonly known as millwork, which includes window and door fittings, sash, baseboard, molding, cornice, etc. The respondents were manufacturers of millwork in Chicago, building contractors who purchase and cause such work to be installed, and representatives of the carpenters' union whose members are employed by both manufacturers and contractors. \n\n[272 U.S. 549, 552]\n\u00a0\n It appears that the respondent manufacturers found their business seriously impeded by the competition of material made by nonunion mills located outside of Illinois-mostly in Wisconsin and the South-which sold their product in the Chicago market cheaper than local manufacturers who employed union labor could afford to do. Their operations were thus abridged, and they did not employ so many carpenters as otherwise they could have done.\n They wished to eliminate the competition of Wisconsin and other nonunion mills, which were paying lower wages and consequently could undersell them. Obviously it would tend to bring about the desired result if a general combination could be secured under which the manufacturers and contractors would employ only union carpenters with the understanding that the latter would refuse to install nonunion-made millwork. And we think there is evidence reasonably tending to show that such a combination was brought about, and that, as intended by all the parties, the so-called outside competition was cut down, and thereby interstate commerce directly and materially impeded. The local manufacturers, relieved from the competition that came through interstate commerce, increased their output and profits; they gave special descounts to local ocntractors; more union carpenters secured employment in Chicago, and their wages were increased. These were the incentives which brought about the combination. The nonunion mills outside of the city found their Chicago market greatly circumscribed or destroyed, the price of buildings was increased, and, as usual under such circumstances, the public paid excessive prices.\n The allegations of the bill were sufficient to cover a combination like the one which some of the evidence tended to show. It is a matter of no consequence that the purpose was to shut out nonunion millwork made \n\n[272 U.S. 549, 553]\n\u00a0\n within Illinois, as well as that made without. The crime of restraining interstate commerce through combination is not condoned by the inclusion of intrastate commerce as well. The applicable principles have been sufficiently indicated in Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38\n, 24 S. Ct. 307; Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S. Ct. 301, 13 Ann.

S.  3466 (Comp St.  6372), and as defined by the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585-9656). Its debts amounted to approximately $3,000,000, and included $1,154,450 due to the United States. The value of its assets was not in excess of $1,500,000. On that day, the Hay Foundry & Iron Works, a simple contract creditor, on behalf of itself and other creditors, brought suit against the respondent in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Among the facts alleged are these: Respondent \n\n[269 U.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n owed plaintiff $7,988.43 for labor and materials furnished, and was without money to pay its debts then due. The value of its property, if properly and prudently realized on, would be more than enough to pay its obligations. Some of its creditors were threatening to bring suits on their claims, and resulting forced sales of the property would cause great loss to the creditors. Plaintiff believed that the property could be preserved for equitable distribution among those entitled thereto only upon the granting of equitable relief including the appointment of receivers, and that, unless the court would deal with the property as a trust fund for the payment of creditors, it would be sacrificed to the great loss of creditors. More would be realized from a sale if the business was being carried on. The prayer was for the appointment of receivers, and that when found to be just and proper the properties be sold and the proceeds distributed among those entitled thereto. By its answer filed on the same day, respondent admitted all the allegations of the complaint, and, with its consent, the court thereupon made an order appointing receivers. The order recited that it was necessary for the protection of the respective rights and equities of creditors that the property and business be administered through receives, and gave to them the exclusive possession, custody and control; they were authorized to continue the business until the further order of the court, to make disbursements necessary to preserve the property, and to pay debts entitled to priority.\n September 1, 1922, the United States filed proof of the debt due from respondent and claimed priority under section 3466, and later filed its intervening petition, setting forth the facts above stated, and prayed to be adjudged entitled to priority. Respondent moved to dismiss. The District Court granted the motion. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 9 F.(2d) 1018. The case is here on certiorari under section 240. Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217).\n\n\n[269 U.S. 504, 513]\n\u00a0\n The question is whether section 3466 applies. That section and section 3467 (Comp. St.  6373), in pari materia, are quoted in Bramwell v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n269 \nU.S. 483\n, 46 S. Ct. 176, decided this day. The intervening petition shows that respondent was insolvent when the creditor's suit was begun, and the question of priority is to be determined on that basis, notwithstanding the complaint alleged and the answer admitted that respondent was solvent. Respondent's answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and its consent to the court's order constituted a necessary step in the proceedings for the appointment of receivers. Re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 90, 109\n, 110 S., 28 S. Ct. 219; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 500\n, 43 S. Ct. 454. So, with the consent and co-operation of the insolvent debtor, the possession and control of all its property were handed over to be administered by the court, through the receivers, for the benefit of those whom the court found entitled to it. Porter v. Sabin, \n149 \nU.S. 473, 479\n, 13 S. Ct. 1008. To induce the action taken by the court, the complaint represented that, if respondent's property was not dealt with as a trust fund for the payment of creditors, they would suffer great loss. It is established that, when a court of equity takes into its possession the assets of an insolvent corporation, it will administer them on the theory that in equity they belong to the creditors and shareholders rather than to the corporation itself. See Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 383\n, 14 S. Ct. 127; Graham v. Railroad Co., \n102 U.S. 148\n, 161. Here, the fund being less than the debts, the creditors are entitled to have all of it distributed among them according to their rights and priorities.\n Taken in connection with its insolvency, now conceded, respondent's answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and its consent to the decree appointing receivers amounted to the handing over of all its property and busi- \n\n[269 U.S. 504, 514]\n\u00a0\n ness to the receivers to be administered, under the direction of the court, as a trust fund to pay respondent's debts. In substance, the things done by respondent amounted to a voluntary assignment of all its property within the meaning of section 3466. The United States is entitled to priority. Bramwell v.

CANDELARIA(1926)\nNo. 208\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 432, 434]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for the United states. \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 435]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank W. Clancy, of Santa Fe , N. M., for Candelaria and others.\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 432, 437]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1922 the United States brought a suit in the federal District Court for New Mexico against Jose Candelaria and others to quiet in the Indian pueblo of Laguma the title to certain lands alleged to belong to the pueblo in virtue of a grant from Spain, its recognition by Mexico, and a confirmation and patent by the United States. The suit was brought on the theory that these Indians are wards of the United States, and that it therefore has authority and is under a duty to protect them in the ownership and enjoyment of their lands. The defendants were alleged to be asserting a false claim to the lands, and to be occupying \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n and fencing the same to the exclusion of the Indians. In their answer the defendants denied the wardship of the United States, and also set up in bar two decrees rendered in prior suits brought against them by the pueblo to quiet the title to the same lands. One suit was described as begun in 1910 in the territorial court, and transferred when New Mexico became a state to the succeeding state court, where on final hearing a decree was given for the defendants on the merits. The other was described as brought in 1916 in the federal District Court, and resulting in a decree of dismissal on the grounds that the complaint disclosed that the matters presented 'were res judicata and that there was no federal question in the case.' In the replication the United States alleged that it was not a party to either of the prior suits; that it neither authorized the bringing of them, nor was represented by the attorney who appeared for the pueblo, and therefore that it was not bound by the decrees.\n On the case thus presented the court held that the decrees operated to bar the prosecution of the present suit by the United States, and on that ground that bill was dismissed. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals which, after outlining the case as just stated, has certified to this court the following questions:\n\n\n (1)\n Are Pueblo Indians in New Mexico in such status of tutelage as to their lands in that state that the United States, as such guardian, is not barred either by a judgment in a suit involving title to such lands begun in the territorial court and passing to judgment after statehood or by a judgment in a similar action in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where, in each of said actions, the United States was not a party nor was the attorney representing such Indians therein authorized so to do by the United States?\n\n\n (2)\n Did the state court of New Mexico have jurisdiction to enter a judgment which would be res judicata as to \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n the United States, in an action between Pueblo Indians and opposed claimants concerning title to land, where the result of that judgment would be to disregard a survey made by the United States of a Spanish or Mexican grant pursuant to an act of Congress confirming such grant to said Pueblo Indians?\n The status of the Pueblo Indians and their lands, and the relation of the United States to both, were considered in United States v. Sandoval, \n231 \nU.S. 28\n, 34 S. Ct. 1. We there said (pages 45-47 (34 S. Ct. 5, 6)):\n'Not only does the Constitution expressly authorize Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, but long-continued legislative and executive usage and an unbroken current of judicial decisions have attributed to the United States as a superior and civilized nation the power and duty of exercising a fostering care and protection over all dependent Indian communities within its borders, whether within its original territory or territory subsequently acquired, and whether within or without the limits of a state. ... 'It is for that body (Congress), and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from such condition of tutelage.'\n\n'Of course, it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe, but only that in respect of distinctly Indian communities the questions whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes requiring the guardianship and protection of the United States are to be determined by Congress, and not by the courts . ...\n\n'As before indicated, by a uniform course of action beginning as early as 1854 and continued up to the present time, the legislative and executive branches of the government have regarded and treated the Pueblos of \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 440]\n\u00a0\n New Mexico as dependent communities, entitled to its aid and protection, like other Indian tribes, and, considering their Indian lineage, isolated and communal life, primitive customs, and limited civilization, this assertion of guardianship over them cannot be said to be arbitrary but must be regarded as both authorized and controlling.'\n\n And also (page 48 (34 S. Ct. 7)):\n'We are not unmindful that in United States v. Joseph, \n94 U.S. 614\n ( 24 L. Ed. 295), there are some observations not in accord with what is here said of these Indians, but as that case did not turn upon the power of Congress over them or their property, but upon the interpretation and purpose of a statute not nearly so comprehensive as the legislation now before us, and as the observations there made respecting the Pueblos were evidently based upon statements in the opinion of the territorial court, then under review, which are at variance with other recognized sources of information, now available, and with the long continued action of the legislative and executive departments, that case cannot be regarded as holding that these Indians or their lands are beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution.'\n\n While we recognized in that case that the Indians of each pueblo, collectively as a community, have a fee-simple title to the lands of the pueblo (other than such as are occupied under executive orders), we held that their lands, like the tribal lands of other Indians owned in fee under patents from the United States, are 'subject to the legislation of Congress enacted in the exercise of the government's guardianship' over Indian tribes and their property.\n The purpose of Congress to subject the Pueblo Indians and their lands to that legislation, if not made certain before the decision in the Joseph Case, was made so in various ways thereafter. Two manifestations of it are significant. A decision of the territorial court in 1904, holding their lands taxable (Territory v. Delinquent Tax List of Bernalillo County, 12 N. M. 136, 76 P. 307), was promptly \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 441]\n\u00a0\n followed by a congressional enactment annulling the taxes already levied and forbidding further levies (33 Stat. 1069, c. 1479); and a decision of that court in 1907, construing the statute which prohibits the sale of liquor to Indians and its introduction into the Indian country as not including these Indians or their lands (United States v. Mares, 14 N. M. 1, 88 P. 1128), was shortly followed by an enactment declaring that the statute should be construed as including both (36 Stat. 560, c. 310). It also is of significance that in 1898 Congress provided for the employment by the Secretary of the Interior of a special attorney to represent the Pueblo Indians and protect their interests (30 Stat. 594, c. 545), and that from that time to this a special attorney has been so employed and has been paid out of the appropriations made by Congress for the purpose ( 42 Stat. 1194, c. 42).\n Many provisions have been enacted by Congress-some general and others special-to prevent the government's Indian wards from improvidently disposing of their lands and becoming homeless public charges. One of these provisions, now embodied in section 2116 of the Revised Statutes, declares:\n'No purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands, or of any title or claim thereto, from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the Constitution.' Comp. St.  4100\n\n\n\n This provision was originally adopted in 1834 (4 Stat. 730, c. 161,  12), and, with others 'regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,' was extended over 'the Indian tribes' of New Mexico in 1851. 9 Stat. 587, c. 14,  7.\n While there is no express reference in the provision to Pueblo Indians, we think it must be taken as including them. They are plainly within its spirit, and, in our opinion, fairly within its words, 'any tribe of Indians.' Although sedentary, industrious, and disposed to peace, they are Indians in race, customs, and domestic government, \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 442]\n\u00a0\n always have lived in isolated communities, and are a simple, uniformed people, ill-prepared to cope with the intelligence and greed of other races. It therefore is difficult to believe that Congress in 1851 was not intending to protect them, but only the nomadic and savage Indians then living in New Mexico A more reasonable view is that the term 'Indian tribe' was used in the acts of 1834 and 1951 in the sense of 'a body of Indians of the same or a similar race, united in a community under one leadership or government, and inhabiting a particular, though sometimes ill-defined, territory.' Montoya v. United States, \n180 \nU.S. 261, 266\n, 21 S. Ct. 358, 359 (45 L. Ed. 521). In that sense the term easily includes Pueblo Indians.\n Under the Spanish law, Pueblo Indians, although having full title to their lands, were regarded as in a state of tutelage, and could alienate their lands only under governmental supervision. See Chouteau v. Molony, 16 How. 203, 237. Text-writers have differed about the situation under the Mexican law; but in United States v. Pico, 5 Wall. 536, 540, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Field, who was specially informed on the subject, expressly recognized that under the laws of Mexico the government 'extended a special guardianship' over Indian pueblos, and that a convveyance of pueblo lands, to be effective, must be made 'under the supervision and with the approval' of designated authorities. And this was the ruling in Sunol v. Hepburn, 1 Cal. 254, 274 et seq. Thus it appears that Congress, in imposing a restriction on the alienation of these lands, as we think it did, was but continuing a policy which prior governments had deemed essential to the protection of such Indians.\n It was settled in Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, \n249 \nU.S. 110\n, 39 S. Ct. 185, that under territorial laws enacted with congressional sanction each pueblo in New Mexico-meaning the Indians comprising the community-became a juristic person and enabled to sue and defend in respect of \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 443]\n\u00a0\n its lands. But in that case there was no occasion, and no attempt, to determine whether or to what extent the United States would be bound by the outcome of such a litigation where it was not a party. That was a suit brought by the pueblo of Santa Rosa to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office from carrying out what was alleged to be an unauthorized purpose and attempt to dispose of the pueblo's lands as public lands of the United States. Arizona was formed from part of New Mexico, and when in that way the pueblo came to be in the new territory it retained its juristic status. Beyond establishing that status, and recognizing that the wardship of the Indians was not an obstacle to the suit, the case is without bearing here. In the opinion it was said:\n'The Indians are not here seeking to establish any power or capacity in themselves to dispose of the lands, but only to prevent a threatened disposal of administrative officers in disregard of their full ownership. Of their capacity to maintain such a suit we entertain no doubt. The existing wardship is not an obstacle, as is shown by repeated decisions of this court, of which Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n197 U.S. 553\n (23 S. Ct. 216) is an illustration.'\n\n With this explanation of the status of the Pueblo Indians and their lands, and of the relation of the United States to both, we come to answer the questions propounded in the certificate.\n To the first question we answer that the United States is not barred. Our reasons will be stated. The Indians of the pueblo are wards of the United States, and hold their lands subject to the restriction that the same cannot be alienated in any wise without its consent. A judgment or decree which operates directly or indirectly to transfer the lands from the Indians, where the United States has not authorized or appeared in the suit, infringes that restriction. The United States has an inter- \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 444]\n\u00a0\n est in maintaining and enforcing the restriction, which cannot be affected by such a judgment or decree. This court has said in dealing with a like situation:\n'It necessarily follows that, as a transfer of the allotted lands contrary to the inhibition of Congress would be a violation of the governmental rights of the United States arising from its obligation to a dependent people, no stipulations, contracts, or judgments rendered in suits to which the Government is a stranger, can affect its interest. The authority of the United States to enforce the restraint lawfully created cannot be impaired by any action without its consent.' Bowling & Miami Investment Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 528, 534\n, 34 S. Ct. 659, 660 (58 L. Ed. 1080).\n\n And that ruling has been recognized and given effect in other cases. Privett v. United States, \n256 U.S. 201\n, 204 41 S. Ct. 455; Sunderland v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 45 S. Ct. 64.\n But, as it appears that for many years the United States has employed and paid a special attorney to represent the Pueblo Indians and look after their interests, our answer is made with the qualification that, if the decree was rendered in a suit begun and prosecuted by the special attorney so employed and paid, we think the United States is as effectually concluded as if it were a party to the suit. Souffront v. Compagnie des Sucreries, \n217 \nU.S. 475, 486\n, 30 S. Ct. 608; Lovejoy v. Murray, 3 Wall. 1, 18; Claflin v. Fletcher (C. C.) 7 F. 851, 852; Maloy v. Duden, 86 F. 402, 404, 30 C. C. A. 137; James v. Germania Iron Co., 107 F. 597, 613, 46 C. C. A. 476.\n Coming to the second question, we eliminate so much of it as refers to a possible disregard of a survey made by the United States, for that would have no bearing on the court's jurisdiction or the binding effect of the judgment or decree, but would present only a question of whether error was committed in the course of exercising jurisdiction. With that eliminated, our answer to the question is that the state court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and proceed to judgment or decree. Whether the \n\n[271 U.S. 432, 445]\n\u00a0\n outcome would be conclusive on the United States is sufficiently shown by our answer to the first question.\n Questions answered as stated in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. CHEMICAL FOUNDATION, INC.(1926)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: October 11, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Messrs. Henry W. Anderson, of Richmond, Va., and Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, William G. Mahaffy, of Wilmington, Del., and Moorfield Storey, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit was brought by the United States in the District Court for Delaware to set aside sales made by it to the Chemical Foundation of a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other similar properties- which for brevity will be referred to as 'patents'-seized pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411, as amended by the act of March 28, 1918, c. 28, 40 Stat. 460, and the Act of November 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020, and other acts (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 a et seq.). The complaint alleges that a number of domestic manufacturers as a result of war conditions had been able to combine and monopolize certain chemical industries in this country, and, fearing that at the end of the war German competition would destroy the monopoly, they conspired to bring about transfers and sales of the patents at nominal prices to themselves or to a corporation controlled by them; that the patents so obtained would control the industries in question and perpetuate the monopoly; and that the sales were procured through the fraudulent deception of the President, the Alien Property Custodian, and other offi- \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n cials. The answer denies conspiracy and fraud, and asserts that the transfers were made in good faith and pursuant to law, and that they are valid. There was a trial at which much evidence was taken. The District Court dismissed the complaint (294 F. 300), and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (5 F. (2d) 191.) Both courts found that no unlawful scheme, combination, or conspiracy was shown, and that there was no deception or fraud.\n The United States took an appeal under section 241, Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1218), and has applied for a writ of certiorari under section 240 (Comp. St.  1217). The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was entered March 26, 1925, prior to the taking effect of the Act of February 13, 1925, amending the Judicial Code. Chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936 (Comp. St .  1120). Since this is not a case in which the decree of that court is made final by section 128, the United States had the right of appeal. The application for certiorari is therefore denied.\n The chemical industries in question are closely related to the production of explosives, gasses, and other things directly used in waging war, as well as to the production of dyestuffs and medicines essential to the welfare of the people. At the outbreak of the war many necessary medicines and other substances, as well as most of the dyestuffs used in this country, were imported from Germany or were manufactured under patents owned by enemy Germans. The amount of such things here produced was small. Importations were hindered by the blockade and ceased when this country entered the war. To meet the demand numerous plants were developed and by 1919 chemicals, dyestuffs, medicines, and the like were being produced here in large quantities. A number of associations of manufacturers were formed for the advancement of such industries; they included in their membership the producers of nearly all the dyestuffs and like chemicals made in this country. Mr. A. Mitchell Palmer was the Alien Property Custodian until he was \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n appointed Attorney General, March 4, 1919. In order to protect the United States against enemy and foreign control of its chemical industries and to stimulate production here, he favored the seizure and sale of the patents in question. To that end a number of conferences were held between his representatives and those of the industries. The plan that was carried into effect was formulated under his direction.\n In February, 1919, the Chemical Foundation was incorporated under the laws of Delaware. The certificate of incorporation discloses that it was created and empowered to purchase enemy-owned patents seized by the Custodian and to hold the 'property and rights so acquired in a fiduciary capacity for the Americanization of such industries as may be affected thereby, for the exclusion or elimination of alien interest hostile or detrimental to the said industries, and for the advancement of chemical and allied science and industry in the United States'; to grant to the United States nonexclusive licenses to make, use, and sell the inventions covered by the patents, and also to grant like licenses, on equal terms and without advantage as between licensees, to American citizens and corporations under control of American citizens. The board of directors is authorized to prescribe the terms and conditions of such licenses. It may refuse to issue any license or may revoke any license granted by it. The corporation is required to enforce its rights and to protect the rights of its licensees. The authorized capital stock is $500,000, consisting of 5, 000 shares of the par value of $100 each: 4,000 shares constitute nonvoting preferred stock, the holders of which are entitled to a cumulative dividend of 6 per centum per annum, and 1,000 shares constitute the common stock, the holders of which are entitled to dividends not exceeding 6 per centum per annum after dividends on the preferred stock have been provided for. The preferred stock is subject to redemption at par plus \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n accumulated dividends, if any, and after such redemption net earnings not needed for working capital 'shall be used and devoted to the development and advancement of chemistry and allied sciences, in the useful arts and manufactures in the United States, in such manner as the board of directors may determine.' The holders of the common stock have all the voting power. The certificate provides that, without the approval of the board of directors, stockholders may not sell any of their stock. The board of directors consists of three members. The executive officers are president, vice president, and a secretary and treasurer. The president and vice president are required to serve without pay. The shares of the Foundation were subscribed by those interested in the chemical and dye industries. But a voting trust agreement was made, pursuant to which all common stock was deposited with, and all voting power was vested in, five trustees. Directors and officers were chosen March 8, 1919. Francis P. Garvan, Douglas I. McKay, and George J. Corbett were made directors and constituted the board. Mr. Garvan, then Alien Property Custodian, was elected president. Mr. McKay was elected vice president, and Mr. Corbett secretary and treasurer. Otto T. Bannard and four others were made voting trustees. All the directors, officers, and voting trustees were chosen by or in accordance with the direction of Mr. Palmer, given while he was Custodian.\n The President, by Executive Order December 3, 1918, declared:\n'I hereby vest in Frank L. Polk all power and authority conferred upon the President by the provisions of section 12' of the Trading with the Enemy Act as amended (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 ff).\n\n Mr. Polk was then counselor for the Department of State, but was not so described in the order. He made two orders, dated respectively February 26, 1919, and April 5, 1919, to authorize the Custodian to sell at private sale to the Foundation without advertisement, at such places and upon such terms and conditions as to the \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n Custodian might seem proper, all patents found to relate to the objects and purposes of the Foundation as expressed in its charter. These orders contained a statement of the reasons therefor in the public interest. Briefly they were that the patents could not be sold to the best advantage at public sale after advertisement; that the Foundation had been incorporated to hold the patents as a trustee for American industries affected by the patents, to eliminate hostile alien interests and to advance chemical and allied industry in the United States, and that it was obligated to grant nonexclusive licenses upon equal terms to qualified American manufacturers and was empowered to grant free licenses to the United States; that the public interest would be best served by a wide use of the inventions, which most readily could be promoted by licenses which the Foundation was obligated to grant; that a private sale would prevent the patents from falling into the hands of purchasers unwilling or unable to use the inventions or who would use them for speculative purposes; that it would be impossible to make a public sale that would secure these benefits, and that a private sale would avoid unnecessary expense, delay and inconvenience.\n Prior to and contemporaneously with the organization of the Foundation, the representatives of the chemical industries co-operated with those of the Custodian in making lists of the patents to be seized and sold by the Custodian to the Foundation. Mr. Garvan, the Custodian, from time to time commencing April 10, 1919, executed and delivered to the Foundation various assignments of the patents. The considerations paid by the Foundation to the Custodian amounted in all to $271,850.00. The President, February 13, 1920, made an executive order which was held by both courts below to constitute a ratification of the transactions. And pursuant to that order, the Custodian confirmed the assignments theretofore made. \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n We come to the question whether, as held below, the Act as amended March 28, 1918, empowered the President to authorize, and the Custodian under his supervision to consummate, these sales.\n The pertinent provisions of the act are in section 12 as amended:\n'The Alien Property Custodian shall be vested with all of the powers of a common-law trustee in respect of all property other than money, which has been or shall be, or which has been or shall be required to be, conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to him in pursuance of the provisions of this act, and, in addition thereto acting under the supervision and direction of the President, and under such rules and regulations as the President shall prescribe, shall have power to manage such property and do any act or things in respect thereof or make any disposition thereof or of any part thereof, by sale or otherwise, and exercise any rights or powers which may be or become appurtenant thereto or to the ownership thereof in like manner as though he were the absolute owner thereof: Provided, that any property sold under this act, except when sold to the United States, shall be sold only to American citizens, at public sale to the highest bidder, after public advertisement of time and place of sale which shall be where the property or a major portion thereof is situated, unless the President stating the reasons therefor, in the public interest shall otherwise determine. ...' 40 Stat. 460.\n\n'After the end of the war any claim of any enemy or of an ally of enemy to any money of other property received and held by the Alien Property Custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury, shall be settled as Congress shall direct. ...' 40 Stat. 424.\n\n It is conceded that when seized the patents belonged to enemy Germans and that they were lawfully taken over by the Custodian. The purpose of the Trading with the Enemy Act was not only to weaken enemy countries \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n by depriving their supporters of their properties (Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 45 S. Ct. 73), but also to promote production in the United States of things useful for the effective prosecution of the war. Section 10(c) authorized the President, if he deemed it for the public welfare, to grant licenses to American citizens or corporations to use any inventions covered by enemy-owned patents. Subsection (c) of section 7 of the Act as amended November 4, 1918 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 d), authorized the seizure of enemy-owned patents, and provided that all property so acquired should be held and disposed of as provided by the act. And there is no ground for contending that the seizure and transfers did not tend to lessen enemy strength and to encourage and safeguard domestic production of things essential to or useful in the prosecution of the war. There is nothing to support a strict construction of the act in respect of the seizure and disposition of enemy property. On the other hand, contemporaneous conditions and war legislation indicate a purpose to employ all legitimate means effectively to prosecute the war. The law should be liberally construed to give effect to the purposes it was enacted to subserve.\n As originally enacted, section 12 gave the Custodian in respect of properties in his possession 'all of the powers of a common-law trustee.' He was authorized, acting under the supervision and direction of the President and under rules and regulations prescribed by the President, to manage the property and do any act or things in respect thereof or make any disposition of it by sale or otherwise and to exercise any rights appurtenant to its ownership 'if and when necessary to prevent waste and protect such property and to the end that the interests of the United States in such property and rights, or of such person as may ultimately become entitled thereto, or to the proceeds thereof, may be preserved and safeguarded.' The Custodian was a mere conservator and \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n was authorized to sell only to prevent waste. But brief experience made it clear that this restriction on the power to dispose of enemy property sometimes operated to defeat the purpose of the act and brought profit and advantage to the enemy. The amendment of March 28, 1918, eliminated the restriction upon the power of sale. It stated that the other powers given were 'in addition' to those of a common-law trustee. And it authorized the Custodian under the President to dispose of such properties by sale or otherwise 'in like manner as though he were the absolute owner thereof.'\n There is no support for a construction that would restrain the force of the broad language used. Congress was untrammeled and free to authorize the seizure, use or appropriation of such properties without any compensation to the owners. There is no constitutional prohibition against confiscation of enemy properties. Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 122; Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268, 305, et seq.; Kirk v. Lynd, \n106 \nU.S. 315, 316\n, 1 S. Ct. 296; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 41 S. Ct. 293; White v. Mechanics Securities Corp., \n269 \nU.S. 283, 300\n, 46 S. Ct. 116. And the act makes no provision for compensation. The former enemy owners have no claim against the patents or the proceeds derived from the sales. It makes no difference to them whether the consideration paid by the Foundation was adequate or inadequate. The provision that after the war enemy claims shall be settled as Congress shall direct conferred no rights upon such owners. Moreover the Treaty of Berlin prevents the enforcement of any claim by Germany or its nationals against the United States or its nationals on account of the seizures and sales in question. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n While not denying the power to confiscate enemy properties, the United States argues that as construed below \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n the provision in question is unconstitutional because it attempts to delegate legislative power to the executive. But the act gave the Custodian acting under the President, full power of disposition. No restriction was put upon dispositions other than by sales. And sales to the United States were not regulated. The general rule laid down was that all dispositions by sale or otherwise should be made in accordance with the determinations of the President; the proviso made an exception including a class of sales; and, upon the failure of the President otherwise to determine stating the reasons therefore in the public interest, it required that such sales should be made as there specified. It was not necessary for Congress to ascertain the facts of or to deal with each case. The act went as far as was reasonably practicable under the circumstances existing. It was peculiarly within the province of the Commander-in-Chief to know the facts and to determine what disposition should be made of enemy properties in order effectively to carry on the war. The determination of the terms of sales of enemy properties in the light of facts and conditions from time to time arising in the progress of war was not the making of a law; it was the application of the general rule laid down by the act. When the plenary power of Congress and the general rule so established are regarded, it is manifest that a limitation upon the excepted class is not a delegation of legislative power. Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 692\n, 12 S. Ct. 495; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 24 S. Ct. 349; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 377\n, 27 S. Ct. 367; United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 516\n, 31 S. Ct. 480.\n The language of the statute is too plain to be misunderstood. Except as affected by the proviso, the Custodian's dominion over the property and power to dispose of it-acting under the President as provided-were as unlimited as are the powers of an absolute owner, and the power of the President to determine terms and \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n conditions of sales or other disposition was not restricted. He was authorized, stating the reasons therefor in the public interest, to dispense with any or all requirements specified in the proviso and to substitute others for them. Cf. Levinson v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 198\n, 42 S. Ct. 275. When the amended section is read in comparison with the original enactment and regard is had to the chemical warfare and other conditions existing at the time of the amendment, March 28, 1918, the inevitable conclusion is that it empowered the President to authorize, and the Custodian acting under him to consummate, the sales in question.\n The United States argues that the Executive Order of December 3, 1918 was void, and that the one of February 13, 1920 did not authorize or ratify the transactions.\n Section 5(a) of the act provides that:\n'The President may exercise any power or authority conferred by this act through such officer or officers as he shall direct.' Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 c.\n\n The language of the executive order is:\n'I hereby vest in Frank L. Polk all power and authority conferred upon the President by the provisions of section 12. ...'\n\n Obviously all the functions of his great office cannot be exercised by the President in person. The contention that power to determine how enemy property should be sold could not be delegated to another is not sustained. This court has had occasion to consider a like question in Certral Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 567\n, 41 S. Ct. 214; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 244\n, 41 S. Ct. 293, supra, and Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, \n262 \nU.S. 51, 53\n, 43 S. Ct. 486. These decisions sustain the delegation here involved.\n It is argued that the order was not made in conformity with the statute because to 'vest' power in another is not to 'act through' him, and because the order did now show that Mr. Polk was an officer. But, if two constructions are possible, and one of them would render the order useless and the other give it validity, the latter is to be adopted. Cf. Panama R. R. Co. Johnson, 264 U. S. \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n 375, 390, 44 S. Ct. 391; United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 75-76. The intention to exert the power conferred under section 5 is plain. Meticulous precision of language was not necessary. Russell Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 43 S. Ct. 428. While the use of the word 'vest' was not accurate, it must be deemed sufficient when the context and circumstances are considered. Mr. Polk was an officer through whom the President was authorized to act. He was counselor for the Department of State, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. United States v. Germaine, \n99 U.S. 508\n. No particular form of designation was required. It would be unreasonable to read the order otherwise than as meaning that, in respect of the matters covered by section 12, the President determined to act through Frank L. Polk, counselor for the Department of State.\n And the validity of each of the orders made by Mr. Polk is attacked by the United States on the ground that it was too broad and constituted an attempt to give to the Custodian the very power granted to the President by the act; that is, the power to determine that enemy properties should be disposed of otherwise than as specified in the proviso. But the contention cannot prevail. Each of the orders sufficiently described the patents seized and authorized a private sale to the Foundation without advertisement. This was enough to indicate a determination to take these sales out of the class covered by the proviso. And it is insisted that the orders were induced by misrepresentation and were made without knowledge of the material facts. But both courts found that the United States failed to establish any conspiracy, fraud or deception alleged. Findings of fact concurred in by two lower courts will not be disturbed, unless clearly erroneous. Washington Sec. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 34 S. Ct. 725. Under this rule the findings must be accepted. The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties. Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 108; United States v. Page, \n137 U.S. 673\n, 679-680, 11 S. Ct. 219; United States v. Nix, \n189 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, 23 S. Ct. 495. Under that presumption, it will be taken that Mr. Polk acted upon knowledge of the material facts. The validity of the reasons stated in the orders, or the basis of fact on which they rest will not be reviewed by the courts. Dakota Cent. Tel. Co. v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163, 184\n, 39 S. Ct. 507, 4 A. L. R. 1623; Monongahela Bridge v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 177, 195\n, 30 S. Ct. 356; Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat, 19, 30. Cf. Levinson v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 201\n, 42 S. Ct. 275, supra.\n We agree with the lower courts that the sales and transfers of the patents were ratified and confirmed by the President's order of February 13, 1920. It is urged that there was no ratification because it is not shown that the President had knowledge of the material facts; that he did not intend to ratify the sales of patents, and that the language used in the order is not broad enough to include the patents, trade-marks, any copyrights in question.\n The Polk order of February 26, 1919, described the property covered as 'all of the letters patent, trade-marks and rights under letters patent and trade-marks, including all profits and damages ... for the past infringement thereof which the Alien Property Custodian may seize or may have seized ... and which he from time to time shall determine relate to the objects and purposes' of the Chemical Foundation. The President's order of confirmation recites that the Polk orders authorized the Custodian to sell 'certain choses in action and rights, interests and benefits heretofore determined to belong to, or to be held for, by, or on account of, or for the benefit of persons heretofore determined to be enemies.' The language last quoted was used to define the same properties that were covered by the Polk orders; that is, 'choses in action and rights,' etc., were used to \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n include 'letters patent, trade-marks,' etc. The President's order also states that it was the intention of the Polk orders to authorize the Custodian to sell 'all choses in action, rights, interests and benefits under agreements and rights and claims of every character and description including rights to receive moneys by way of royalties or otherwise as compensation for the use of patents, trade-marks or trade-names which the Alien Property Custodian may have seized ... and ... determined to relate to the objects and purposes' of the Foundation. It recites that doubt had arisen as to the authority of the Custodian to sell and convey to the Foundation 'certain of the said choses in action,' etc., 'including rights to receive moneys by way of royalties or otherwise.' And the President expressly authorized the Custodian to sell at private sale without public or other advertisement to the Foundation upon such terms and conditions as to the Custodian might seem proper 'all choses in action, rights, interests and benefits under agreements and rights and claims of every character and description which the Alien Property Custodian may seize or may have seized' under the act. The President further authorized the Custodian by a suitable instrument to conform and ratify sales theretofore made by him of any property as to which his authority under the Polk orders might be deemed doubtful. And he stated that his reasons for the determination and order were given in the Polk orders and in addition specified other reasons which need not be quoted.\n This order authorizes sales of the patents to be made and ratifies and confirms those theretofore made by the Custodian. The President will be presumed to have known the material facts and to have acted in the light of them. His intention to ratify the sales is plain. The comprehensive language used is broad enough to include the patents. Moreover the statement that his reasons for the determination are given in the Polk orders shows \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n the intention to cover the properties there referred to. As the transactions in question were ratified, it is unnecessary to consider the objections made by the United States to the procedure of the Custodian under the Polk orders.\n The United States contends that the sales were void because made in violation of section 41 of the Criminal Code, 35 Stat. 1088, 1097 (Comp. St.  10205), and the rule of law forbidding sales by a public officer or fiduciary of trust property in his custody to himself or to a corporation of which he is the head.\n Section 41 provides:\n'No officer or agent of any corporation, ... and no ... person directly or indirectly interested in the pecuniary profits or contracts of such corporation, ... shall be employed or shall act as an officer or agent of the United States for the transaction of business with such corporation, ...'\n\n Violators are made punishable by fine and imprisonment. The United States lays much stress on these facts: Mr. Garvan, while director of the Bureau of Investigation, Joseph H. Choate, Jr., chief of the chemical division of that bureau, and Ramsey Hoguet, patent attorney for the Custodian, conferred with the representatives of the chemical industries to arrange to make the seizures and sales of the patents. Later, Mr. Garvan, then Custodian, acted for the United States in making the transfers to the Chemical Foundation, of which he was the President. Mr. McKay and Mr. Corbett were directors and officers appointed by the Custodian of various corporations of which he had taken control. Before the transfers were made, Mr. Choate became the general counsel and Mr. Hoguet the patent attorney of the Foundation. Mr. Bannard and the other voting trustees were members of the Advisory Sales Committee-appointed by the President to see that sales of enemy properties were fairly made to qualified buyers. Without further reference to the facts relied on to sup- \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n port its contention, we assume in favor of the United States that those who acted for it in the transactions complained of were at the same time directors and officers of the corporation; that the members of the Advisory Sales Committee, while they were voting trustees, participated in the fixing of the prices paid for the patents by the Foundation, and that such prices were much less than the value of the properties and would have been inadequate to constitute just compensation if the patents belonged to nonenemy owners and were taken for public use under the power of eminent domain.\n Section 41 was enacted when there was no war, and long before the Trading with the Enemy Act. It lays down a general rule for the protection of the United States in transactions between it and corporations and to prevent its action from being influenced by any one interested adversely to it. It is a penal statute and is not to be extended to cases not clearly within its terms or to those exceptional to its spirit and purpose. United States v. Noveck, 46 S. Ct. 476;1 Baender v. Barnett, \n255 \nU.S. 224, 226\n, 41 S. Ct. 271; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197, 212\n, 23 S. Ct. 787; United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, 486; Bishop on Statutory Crimes (3d Ed.)  235. At the time of the enactment, there were no enemy properties to be dealt with; and, save the generality of the language used, there is nothing to indicate a legislative purpose to deal with that subject. The Trading with the Enemy Act is a war measure covering specifically, fully and exclusively the seizure and disposition of enemy properties. The authority of the President to authorize sales and to determine terms and conditions in lieu of those specified in the proviso undoubtedly included the power to cause the Chemical Foundation to be incorporated to purchase and hold the patents as specified and to direct the selection of the directors, officers and voting trustees. The President, and under him the Custodian, acting for the United \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n States, the seller of the patents, caused the Foundation to be created to buy and hold them and caused it to be controlled by officers or representatives of the United States acting exclusively in its interest. Neither Mr. Garvan nor any of the others who acted for the United States had any financial interest in the Foundation, its profits or its contracts. All the corporate shares were subscribed and paid for by others-those interested in the chemical industries. They furnished the money to carry out the plan formulated by or under the direction of Mr. Palmer while he was Custodian. Under the voting trust agreement, shareholders were divested of all voice in the control, business or affairs of the corporation. All shares are to be held by the voting trustee for 17 years, within which all patents will expire, And by charter provisions dividends were limited to 6 per centum per annum. Transferable certificates of beneficial interest were issued by the trustees to the shareholders, but these cannot be used to control the corporation. The arrangement was intended to amount to a public trust for those whom the patents will benefit and for the promotion of American industries, and to give to them the right to have on equal and reasonable terms licenses to make, use and sell the inventions covered by the patents. The Foundation is properly to be considered an instrumentality created under the direction of the President to effect that disposition and subsequent control of the patents which he determined to be in the public interest. The transactions complained of did not involve any of the evils aimed at by section 41. The act will be construed and applied as not qualified or affected by that provision of the Criminal Code. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 406\n, 37 S. Ct. 387; Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 125\n, 24 S. Ct. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655; Townsend v. Little, \n109 \nU.S. 504, 512\n, 3 S. Ct. 357; In re Rouse, Hazard & Co., 91 F. 96, 100, 33 C. C. A. 356. And, as the power to dispose of the properties \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n by sales on the terms and conditions specified was included in the grant made by the statute, it follows that the rule in respect of sales of trust properties by fiduciaries does not apply.\n Before the commencement of the trial, the District Court found that it was necessary that the testimony be taken down in shorthand and transcribed, and appointed an official stenographer for that purpose; and it was ordered that his fees be ultimately taxed as a part of the costs. By another order, counsel consenting, the court directed that the expense of printing 100 copies of the transcript, to be available for use in that court and on appeal, be advanced from time to time and borne in equal amounts by the parties and form a part of the taxable costs. The decree directs that the Chemical Foundation recover from the United States the money advanced by the Foundation on account of such fees and expenses, and orders the amount to be taxed as costs in the case. The government insists that this is erroneous.\n The general rule is that, in the absence of a statute directly authorizing it, courts will not give judgment against the United States for costs or expenses. United States v. Hooe, 3 Cranch, 73, 91, 92; Shewan & Sons v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 86\n, 45 S. Ct. 238; United States v. Davis, 54 F. 147, 152, et seq., 4 C. C. A. 251. But the Foundation insists that under equity rule 50, taken with the consent of counsel and the orders, the court was authorized to direct that these items be taxed as costs and to give judgment against the United States therefor.\n Equity rule 50 in general terms provides that stenographers' fees shall be fixed by the court and taxed as costs, but it does not specify costs or judgment for money against the United States, The rule does not mention the United States and does not affect the sovereign prerogative not to pay costs. Congress alone has power to waive or qualify that immunity. But no statute author- \n\n[272 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n izes the giving of judgment against the United States for these items or authorizes the Attorney General or other counsel in the case to consent to such a judgment. No such authority is necessary for the proper conduct of litigation on behalf of the United States, and there is no ground for implying that authority. It follows that the direction for judgment against the United States for costs cannot be sustained. That part of the decree will be eliminated; and the decree, so modified, will be affirmed.\n Decree modified, and affirmed, as modified.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Part X, section IV, article 297, and annex paragraphs 1 and 3, Treaty of Versailles, adopted by article II(1), Treaty of Berlin, 42 Stat. 1939, 1943. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n271 U.S. 201\n. \n\n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 10199). This entire section is set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[270 U.S. 339, 342]\n\u00a0\n The indictment was dismissed, on demurrer, upon the ground that the statute did not make the matters charged a crime against the United States. 2 This writ of error was then allowed by the District Judge under the provision of \n\n[270 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n the Criminal Appeals Act,3 permitting the United States a direct writ of error from a judgment sustaining a demurrer to an indictment, based upon the construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded. United States v. Patten, 33 S. Ct. 141, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 44 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 325.\n The statute provides, inter alia, that: Whoever 'for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or approval of' any 'claim upon or against the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder,' or 'for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States, or any department thereof,' or any such corporation, 'shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher,' etc., shall be punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both.\n The indictment charged that Cohn, for the purpose of obtaining the approval of a claim against the Government and the Treasury Department to the possession of imported merchandise, and for the purpose and with the intent of defrauding the Government and the Treasury Department through a perversion and obstruction of the customhouse function and of the proper and orderly administration of the laws of the United States and the regulations of the Department, had concealed and covered up material facts by a trick, scheme or device, and had knowingly caused false and fraudulent statements to be made, as follows:\n In October, 1920, a certain lot of cigars arrived at Chicago from the Philippine Islands for entry at the customhouse, and came into the possession of the col- \n\n[270 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n lector of customs. They were consigned to order 'notify Cohn Bros. Cigar Co.,' the name under which Cohn conducted his business. The next day a Chicago Bank received from a Philippine Bank a bill of lading covering the cigars, indorsed in blank by the consignor, with an attached draft drawn by the conignor upon the Cigar Co., and instructions to deliver the bill of lading only upon payment of the draft. Two days later, the draft not having been paid, Cohn, knowing these facts, fraudulently procured certain customhouse brokers to make entry of the cigars and obtain possession of them from the collector by giving a bond for the production of the bill of lading. The possession of the cigars was thus secured by Cohn upon false and fraudulent statements and representations made by him to the brokers, and through them, as his innocent agents, to the collector, that the bill of lading had not arrived in Chicago and that he was entitled to the entry and possession of the cigars, and the fraudulent concealment by him from the brokers and the collector of the material facts that the bill of lading and attached draft had arrived in Chicago, with the condition stated, and that the draft had not then been paid; thereby inducing the collector to deliver the possession of the cigars, when he 'would and should have refused so to do' if he had known these facts and that Cohn consequently had no right to make the entry or obtain possession of the cigars.\n While the cigars were admissible into the United States free of duty, the Customs Regulations nevertheless required that they should be entered at the customhouse, Arts. 192, 215. The Regulations also provided that a bill of lading was necessary to establish the right to make the entry, Art. 219; that merchandise consigned to order should be deemed the property of the holder of a bill of lading indorsed by the consignor, Art. 219;4 that such \n\n[270 U.S. 339, 345]\n\u00a0\n holder might make the entry, Art. 220; and, further, that the collector might in his discretion permit entry to be made without the production of the bill of lading, on a bond conditioned for its subsequent production and indemnifying him against any loss or damage which might be sustained by reason of such permission. Customs Regulations of 1915, pp. 126, 138, 140.\n We may assume, without deciding, that under these Regulations Cohn was not entitled to enter and obtain possession of the cigars until he had paid the draft and become the holder of the bill of lading. But even so, the acts by which the possession of the cigars were obtained did not constitute an offense against the United States unless done for one or other of the purposes entering into the statutory definition of the offense and charged in the indictment, that is, either for the purpose of obtaining the approval of a 'claim upon or against' the Government or for the purpose of 'defrauding' the Government. It is contended by the United States that, although the cigars were duty free, the facts alleged in the indictment show that their possession was wrongfully obtained for both of these purposes. We cannot sustain this contention in either of its aspects.\n Obtaining the possession of non-dutiable merchandise from a collector is not obtaining the approval of a 'claim upon or against' the Government, within the meaning of the statute. While the word 'claim' may sometimes be used in the broad juridical sense of 'a demand of some matter as of right, made by one person upon another, to do or to forbear to do some act or thing as a matter of duty,' Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 615 (10 L. Ed. 1060), it is clear, in the light of the entire context, that in the present statute, the provision relating to the payment or approval of a 'claim upon or against' the Government relates solely to the payment or approval of a claim for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Gov- \n\n[270 U.S. 339, 346]\n\u00a0\n ernment, based upon the Government's own liability to the claimant. And obviously it does not include an application for the entry and delivery of non-dutiable merchandise, as to which no claim is asserted against the Government, to which the Government makes no claim, and which is merely in the temporary possession of an agent of the Government for delivery to the person who may be entitled to its possession. This is not the assertion of a 'claim upon or against' the Government, within the meaning of the statute; and the delivery of the possession is not the 'approval' of such a claim.\n Neither is the wrongful obtaining of possession of such non-dutiable merchandise a 'defrauding' of the Government within the meaning of the statute. It is contended by the United States that, by analogy to the decisions in Haas v. Henkel, 30 S. Ct. 249, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 479\n, 17 S. Ann. Cas. 1112, and Hammerschmidt v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 511, \n265 U.S. 182\n, 188, and other cases involving the construction of section 37 of the Penal Code (Comp. St. s 10201), relating to conspiracies to defraud the United States, the word 'defrauding' in the present statute should be construed as being used not merely in its primary sense of cheating the Government out of property or money, but also in the secondary sense of interfering with or obstructing one of its lawful governmental functions by deceitful and fraudulent means. The language of the two statutes is, however, so essentially different as to destroy the weight of the supposed analogy. Section 37, by its specific terms, extends broadly to every conspiracy to defraud the United States in any manner and for any purpose,' with no words of limitation whatsoever, and no limitation that can be implied from the context. Section 35, on the other hand, has no words extending the meaning of the word 'defrauding' beyond its usual and primary sense. On the contrary it is used in connection with the words 'cheating or swindling,' indicating that it is to be construed in the manner in which those words are ordinarily \n\n[270 U.S. 339, 347]\n\u00a0\n used, as relating to the fraudulent causing of pecuniary or property loss. And this meaning is emphasized by other provisions of the section in which the word 'defraud' is used in reference to the obtaining of money or other property from the Government by false claims, vouchers and the like; and by the context of the entire section, which deals with the wrongful obtaining of money and other property of the Government, with no reference to the impairment or obstruction of its government functions.\n We hence conclude that the indictment did not show, within the meaning of section 35 of the Penal Code, either the purpose of obtaining the approval of a 'claim upon for against' the United States and the Treasury Department, or the purpose and intent of 'defrauding' them. The demurrer was rightly sustained; and the judgment of the District Court is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 35.

GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.(1926)\nNo. 113\nArgued: October 13, 1926Decided: November 23, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Neave, of New York City, for General Electric Co.\n Mr. Fred H. Wood, of New York City, for Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity, brought by the United States in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to enjoin the General Electric Company, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, and the Westinghouse Lamp Company from further violation of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890. 26 Stat. 209, c. 647 (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830). The bill made two charges, one that the General Electric Company, in its business of making and selling incandescent electric lights, had devised and was carrying out a plan for their distribution throughout out the United States by a number of socalled agents, exceeding 21,000, to restrain interstate trade in such lamps and to exercise a monopoly of the sale thereof; and, second, that it was achieving the same illegal purpose through a contract of license with the defendants, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company and the Westinghouse house Lamp Company. As the Westinghouse Lamp Company is a corporation all of whose stock is owned by the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, and is but its selling agent, we may treat the two as one, and reference hereafter will be only to the defendants the General Elec- \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n tric Company, which we shall call the Electric Company, and the Westinghouse Company.\n The government alleged that the system of distribution adopted was merely a device to enable the Electric Company to fix the resale prices of lamps in the hands of purchasers, that the so-called agents were in fact wholesale and retail merchants, and the lamps passed through the ordinary channels of commerce in the ordinary way, and that the restraint was the same and just as unlawful as if the so-called agents were avowed purchasers handling the lamps under resale price agreements. The Electric Company answered that its distributors were bona fide agents, that it had the legal right to market its lamps and pass them directly to the consumer by such agents, and at prices and by a system prescribed by it and agreed upon between it and its agents, there being no limitation sought as to resale prices upon those who purchased from such agents.\n The second question in the case involves the validity of a license granted March 1, 1912, by the Electric Company to the Westinghouse Company to make, use, and sell lamps under the patents owned by the former. It was charged that the license in effect provided that the Westinghouse Company would follow prices and terms of sale from time to time fixed by the Electric Company and observed by it, and that the Westinghouse Company would, with regard to lamps manufactured by it under the license, adopt and maintain the same conditions of sale as observed by the Electric Company in the distribution of lamps manufactured by it.\n The District Court upon a full hearing dismissed the bill for want of equity and this is an appeal under section 2 of the Act of February 11, 1903, known as the Expediting Act (32 Stat. 823, c. 544,  2 (Comp. St.  8825)).\n There had been a prior litigation between the United States and the three defendants and 32 other cor- \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n porations, in which the government sued to dissolve an illegal combination in restraint of interstate commerce in electric lamps, in violation of the Anti-Trust Act, and to enjoin its further violation. A consent decree was entered in that cause, by which the combination was dissolved, the subsidiary corporations surrendered their charters and their properties were taken over by the General Electric Company. The defendants were all enjoined from fixing resale prices for purchasers, except that the owner of the patents were permitted to fix the prices at which a licensee should sell lamps manufactured by it under the patent. After the decree was entered, a new sales plan, which was the one here complained of, was submitted to the Attorney General. The Attorney General declined to express an opinion as to its legality. The plan was adopted and has been in operation since 1912\n\n\n The government insists that these circumstances tend to support the government's view that the new plan was a mere evasion of the restrictions of the decree and was intended to carry out the same evil result that had been condemned in the prior litigation. There is really no conflict of testimony in the sense of a variation as to the facts but only a difference as to the inference to be drawn therefrom. The evidence is all included in a stipulation as to certain facts, as to what certain witnesses for the defendants would testify, and as to the written contracts of license and agency made by the General Electric Company and the Westinghouse Company.\n The General Electric Company is the owner of three patents-one of 1912 to Just & Hanaman, the basic patent for the use of tungsten filaments in the manufacture of electric lamps; the Coolidge patent of 1913, covering a process of manufacturing tungsten filaments by which their tensile strength and endurance is greatly increased; and, third, the Langmuir patent of 1916, which is for the use of gas in the bulb, by which the intensity of the \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n light is substantially heightened. These three patents cover completely the making of the modern electric lights with the tungsten filaments, and secure to the General Electric Company the monopoly of their making, using, and vending.\n The total business in electric lights for the year 1921 was $68,300, 000, and the relative percentages of business done by the companies were: General Electric, 69 per cent.; Westinghouse, 16 per cent.; other licensees, 8 per cent.; and manufacturers not licensed, 7 per cent. The plan of distribution by the Electric Company divides the trade into three classes. The first class is that of sales to large consumers readily reached by the General Electric Company, negotiated by its own salaried employees, and the deliveries made from its own factories and warehouses. The second class is of sales to large consumers under contracts with the General Electric Company, negotiated by agents, the deliveries being made from stock in the custody of the agents; and the third is of the sales to general consumers by agents under similar contracts. The agents under the second class are called B agents, and the agents under the third class are called A agents. Each B agent is appointed by the General Electric Company by the execution and delivery of a contract for the appointment, which lasts a year from a stated date, unless sooner terminated. It provides that the company is to maintain on consignment in the custody of the agent a stock of lamps, the sizes, types, classes, and quantity of which and the length of time which they are to remain in stock to be determined by the company. The lamps consigned to the agents are to be kept in their respective places of business, where they may be readily inspected and identified by the company. The consigned stock, or any part of it, is to be returned to the company as it may direct. The agent is to keep account books and records giving the complete information as to his dealings for the inspec- \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n tion of the company. All of the lamps in such consigned stock are to be and remain the property of the company until the lamps are sold, and the proceeds of all lamps are to be held in trust for the benefit and for the account of the company until fully accounted for. The B agent is authorized to deal with the lamps on consignment with him in three ways- first to distribute the lamps to the company's A agents as authorized by the company; second, to sell lamps from the stock to any consumer to the extent of his requirements for immediate delivery at prices specified by the company; third, to deliver lamps from the stock to any purchaser under written contract with the company to whom the B agent may be authorized by the company to deliver lamps at the prices and on the terms stated in the contract. The B agent has no authority to dispose of any of the lamps, except as above provided, and is not to control or attempt to control prices at which any purchaser shall sell any of such lamps. The agent is to pay all expenses in the storage, cartage, transportation, handling, sale, and distribution of lamps, and all expenses incident thereto and to the accounting therefor, and to the collection of accounts created. This transportation does not include the freight for the lamps in the consignment from the company to the agent. The agent guarantees the return to the company of all unsold lamps in the custody of the agent within a certain time after the termination of his agency. The agent is to pay over to the company not later than the 15th of each month an amount equal to the total sales value, less the agent's compensation, of all of the company's lamps sold by him-that is, first, of the collections that have been made; second, of those customers' accounts which are past due. This is to comply with the guaranty of the agent of due and prompt payment for all lamps sold by him from his stock. Third, the agent is to pay to the company the value of all of the company's \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n lamps lost or missing from or damaged in the stock in his custody.\n There is a basic rate of commission payable to the agent, and there are certain special supplemental and additional compensations for prompt and efficient service. If the agent becomes insolvent, or fails to make reports and remittances, or fails in any of his obligations, the appointment may be terminated, and, when terminated, either at the end of the year or otherwise, the consigned lamps remaining unsold are to be delivered to the manufacturer. It appears in the evidence that since 1915, although there is no specific agreement to this effect, the company has assumed all risk of fire, flood, absolescence, and price decline, and carries whatever insurance is carried on the stocks of lamps in the hands of its agents and pays whatever taxes are assessed. This is relevant as a circumstances to confirm the view that the so-called relation of agent to the company is the real one. There are 400 of the B agents, the large distributors. They recommend to the company efficient and reliable distributors in the localities with which they are respectively familiar, to act as A agents, whom the company appoints. There are 21,000 or more of the A agents. They are usually retail electrical supply dealers in smaller places. The only sales which the A agent is authorized to make are to consumers for immediate delivery and to purchasers under written contract with the manufacturer, just as in the case of the B agents. The plan was, of course, devised for the purpose of enabling the company to deal directly with consumers and purchasers, and doubtless was intended to avoid selling the lamps owned by the company to jobbers or dealers and prevent sale by these middlemen to consumers at different and competing prices. The question is whether, in view of the arrangements made by the company with those who ordinarily and usually would be merchants buying from the manufacturer and selling to the public, such persons \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n are to be treated as agents or as owners of the lamps, consigned to them under such contracts. If they are to be regarded really as purchasers, then the restriction as to the prices at which the sales are to be made is a restraint of trade and a violation of the Anti-Trust Law.\n We find nothing in the form of the contracts and the practice under them which makes the so-called B and A agents anything more than genuine agents of the company, or the delivery of the stock to each agent anything more than a consignment to the agent for his custody and sale as such. He is not obliged to pay over money for the stock held by him until it is sold. As he guarantees the account when made, he must turn over what should have been paid whether he gets it or not. This term occurs in a frequent form of pure agency known as sale by del credere commission. There is no conflict in the agent's obligation to account for all lamps lost, missing, or damaged in the stock. It is only a reasonable provision to secure his careful handling of the goods intrusted to him. We find nothing in his agreement to pay the expense of storage, cartage, transportation (except the freight on the original consignment), handling and the sale and distribution of the lamps, inconsistent with his relation as agent. The expense of this is of course covered in the amount of his fixed commission. The agent has no power to deal with the lamps in any way inconsistent with the retained ownership of the lamps by the company. When they are delivered by him to the purchasers, the title passes directly from the company to those purchasers. There is no evidence that any purchaser from the company or any of its agents is put under any obligation to sell at any price, or to deal with the lamps purchased except as an independent owner. The circumstance that the agents were in their regular business wholesale or retail merchants, and under a prior arrangement had bought the lamps and sold them as \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n their owners, did not prevent a change in their relation to the company. We find no reason in this record to hold that the change in this case was not in good faith and actually maintained.\n But it is said that the system of distribution is so complicated and involves such a very large number of agents, distributed throughout the entire country, that the very size and comprehensiveness of the scheme brings it within the Anti-Trust Law. We do not question that in a suit under the Anti-Trust Act the circumstance that the combination effected secures domination of so large a part of the business affected as to control prices is usually most important in proof of a monopoly violating the act. But under the patent law the patentee is given by statute a monopoly of making, using and selling the patented article. The extent of his monopoly in the articles sold and in the territory of the United States where sold is not limited in the grant of his patent, and the comprehensiveness of his control of the business in the sale of the patented article is not necessarily an indication of illegality of his method. As long as he makes no effort to fasten upon ownership of the articles, he sells control of the prices at which his purchaser shall sell, it makes no difference how widespread his monopoly. It is only when he adopts a combination with others, by which he steps out of the scope of his patent rights and seeks to control and restrain those be whom he has sold his patented articles in their subsequent disposition of what is theirs, that he comes within the operation of the Anti-Trust Act. The validity of the Electric Company's scheme of distribution of its electric lamps turns, therefore, on the question whether the sales are by the company through its agents to the consumer, or are in fact by the company to the so-called agents at the time of consignment. The distinction in law and fact between an agency and a sale is clear. For the reasons already stated, we find no \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n ground for inference that the contracts made between the company and its agents are, or were intended, to be other than what their language makes them.\n The government relies in its contention for a different conclusion on the case of Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373\n, 31 S. Ct. 376 That case was a bill in equity brought by the Miles Medical Company to enjoin Park & Sons Company from continuing an alleged conspiracy with a number of wholesale and retail dealers in proprietary medicines, to induce the persons who had entered into certain agency contracts, to the number of 21,000 through the country, to break their contracts of agency with the Medical Company, to the great injury of that company. The agency concerned the sale of proprietary medicines prepared by secret methods and formulas and identified by distinctive packages and trade-marks. The company had an extensive trade throughout the United States and certain foreign countries. It had been its practice to sell its medicines to jobbers and wholesale druggists, who in turn sold to retail druggists for sale to the customer. It had fixed not only the price of its own sales to jobbers and wholesale dealers but also the prices of jobbers and small dealers. The defendants had inaugurated a cut- rate or cutprice system, which had caused great damage to the complainants' business, injuriously affected its reputation, and depleted the sales of its remedies. The bill was demurred to, on the ground that the methods set forth in the bill, by which attempt was made to control the sales of prices to consumers was illegal both at common law and under the Anti-Trust Act, and deprived the bill of any equity. This was the issue considered by the court.\n The plan of distribution of the Miles Medical Company resembled in many details the plan of distribution in the present case, except that the subject-matter there was medicine by a secret formula, and not a patented article. \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 487]\n\u00a0\n But there were certain vital differences. These led the Circuit Court of Appeals (164 F. 803, 90 C. C. A. 579) to declare that the language of the so-called contracts of agency were false in their purport, and were merely used to conceal what were really sales to the so-called agents. This conclusion was sustained by certain allegations in the bill inconsistent with the contracts of agency, to the effect that the Medical Company did sell to these so-called agents the medical packages consigned. This court, however, without reference to these telltale allegations of the bill found in the contracts themselves and their operation plain provision for purchases by the so-called agents which necessarily made the contracts as to an indefinite amount of the consignments to them, contracts of sale rather than of agency. The court therefore held that the showing made was of an attempt by the Miles Medical Company through its plan of distribution to hold its purchasers after the purchase at full price to an obligation to maintain prices on a resale by them. This is the whole effect of the Miles Medical Case. That such it was is made plain in the case of Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 \nU.S. 8, 21\n, 38 S. Ct. 257, 259 (62 L. Ed. 551, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 447) in which then Chief Justice White reviewed the various cases on this general subject and spoke of the Miles Medical Case as follows:\n'In Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 U.S. 373\n (31 S. Ct. 376) it was decided that under the general law the owner of movables (in that case, proprietary medicines compounded by a secret formula) could not sell the movables and lawfully by contract fix a price at which the product should afterwards be sold, because to do so would be at one and the same time to sell and retain, to part with and yet to hold, to project the will of the seller so as to cause it to control the movable parted with when it was not subject to his will because owned by another, and thus to make the will of the seller unwarrantedly take the place of the law of the land as to such movables. \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 488]\n\u00a0\n It was decided that the power to make the limitation as to price for the future could not be exerted consistently with the prohibitions against restraint of trade and monopoly contained in the Anti-Trust Law.'\n\n Nor does the case of Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S. Ct. 9, sustain the contention of the government on the first question. There a number of manufacturers, one of whom owned a patent for enameled iron ware for plumbing fixtures made a combination to accept licenses to make the patented commodities and to sell them in interstate trade to jobbers and to refuse to sell to jobbers who would not agree to maintain fixed prices in sales to plumbers. This was an attempt just like that in the Miles Medical Co. Case to control the trade in the articles sold and fasten upon purchasers who nad bought at full price and were complete owners an obligation to maintain resale prices.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that there is nothing as a matter of principle or in the authorities which requires us to hold that genuine contracts of agency like those before us, however comprehensive as a mass or whole in their effect, are violations of the Anti-Trust Act. The owner of an article patented or otherwise is not violating the common law or the Anti-Trust Act by seeking to dispose of his articles directly to the consumer and fixing the price by which his agents transfer the title from him directly to such consumer. The first charge in the bill can not be sustained.\n Second. Had the Electric Company as the owner of the patents, entirely controlling the manufacture, use and sale of the tungsten incandescent lamps, in its license to the Westinghouse Company, the right to impose the condition that its sales should be at prices fixed by the licensor and subject to change according to its discretion? The contention is also made that the license required the Westinghouse Company not only to conform in the matter \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 489]\n\u00a0\n of the prices at which it might vend the patented articles, but also to follow the same plan as that which we have already explained the Electric Company adopted in its distribution. It does not appear that this provision was express in the license, because no such plan was set out therein, but even if the construction urged by the government is correct, we think the result must be the same.\n The owner of a patent may assign it to another and convey (1) the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the invention throughout the United States; or (2) an undivided part or share of that exclusive right; or (3) the exclusive right under the patent within and through a specific part of the United States. But any assignment or transfer short of one of these is a license giving the licensee no title in the patent and no right to sue at law in his own name for an infringement. Waterman v. Mackenzie, \n138 \nU.S. 252, 255\n, 11 S. Ct. 334; Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 494, 495; Moore v. Marsh, 7 Wall. 515, and Crown Co. v. Nye Tool Works, \n261 \nU.S. 24, 30\n, 43 S. Ct. 254. Conveying less than title to the patent or part of it, the patentee may grant a license to make, use, and vend articles under the specifications of his patent for any royalty, or upon any condition the performance of which is reasonably within the reward which the patentee by the grant of the patent is entitled to secure. It is well settled, as already said, that where a patentee makes the patented article, and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee's rights. Adams v. Burks, 17 Wall. 453; Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539; Mitchell v. Hawley, 16 Wall. 544; Hobbie v. Jennison, \n149 \nU.S. 355\n, 13 S. Ct. 879; Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co., \n157 \nU.S. 659\n, 15 S. Ct. 738.\n But the question is a different one which arises when we consider what a patentee who grants a license to one to make and vend the patented article may do in limiting the licensee in the \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 490]\n\u00a0\n exercise of the right to sell. The patentee may make and grant a license to another to make and use the patented articles but withhold his right to sell them. The licensee in such a case acquires an interest in the articles made. He owns the material of them and may use them. But if he sells them he infringes the right of the patentee, and may be held for damages and enjoined. If the patentee goes further and licenses the selling of the articles, may he limit the selling by limiting the method of sale and the price? We think he may do so provided the conditions of sale are normally and reasonably adapted to secure pecuniary reward for the patentee's monopoly. One of the valuable elements of the exclusive right of a patentee is to acquire profit by the price at which the article is sold. The higher the price, the greater the profit, unless it is prohibitory. When the patentee licenses another to make and vend and retains the right to continue to make and vend on his own account, the price at which his licensee will sell will necessarily affect the price at which he can sell his own patented goods. It would seem entirely reasonable that he should say to the licensee, 'Yes, you may make and sell articles under my patent but not so as to destroy the profit that I wish to obtain by making them and selling them myself.' He does not thereby sell outright to the licensee the articles the latter may make and sell or vest absolute ownership in them. He restricts the property and interest the licensee has in the goods he makes and proposes to sell.\n This question was considered by this court in the case of Bement v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70\n, 22 S. Ct. 747. A combination of manufacturers owning a patent to make float spring tool harrows licensed others to make and sell the products under the patent on condition that they would not during the continuance of the license sell the products at a less price or on more favorable terms of payment and delivery to purchasers than were set forth \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 491]\n\u00a0\n in a schedule made part of the license. That was held to be a valid use of the patent rights of the owners of the patent. It was objected that this made for a monopoly. The court, speaking by Mr. Justice Peckham, said ( page 91 (22 S. Ct. 755)):\n'The very object of these laws is monopoly, and the rule is, with few exceptions, that any conditions which are not in their very nature illegal with regard to this kind of property, imposed by the patentee and agreed to by the licensee for the right to manufacture or use or sell the article, will be upheld by the courts. The fact that the conditions in the contracts keep up the monopoly or fix prices does nor render them illegal.'\n\n Speaking of the contract, he said (page 93 (22 S. Ct. 756)):\n'The provision in regard to the price at which the licensee would sell the article manufactured under the license was also an appropriate and reasonable condition. It tended to keep up the price of the implements manufactured and sold, but that was only recognizing the nature of the property dealt in, and providing for its value so far as possible. This the parties were legally entitled to do. The owner of a patented article can, of course, charge such price as he msy choose, and the owner of a patent may assign it or sell the right to manufacture and sell the article patented upon the condition that the assignee shall charge a certain amount for such article.'\n\n The question which the court had before it in that case came to it on a writ of error to the Court of Appeals of New York, and raised the federal issue whether a contract of license of this kind, having a wide operation in the sales of the harrows, was invalid because a violation of the Anti-Trust law. This court held that it was not.\n It is argued, however, that Bement v. National Harrow Co. has been in effect overruled. The claim is based on the fact that one of the cases cited by Mr. Justice Peckham in that case was Heaton-Peninsular Button- Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 77 F. \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 492]\n\u00a0\n 288, 25 C. C. A. 267, 35 L. R. A. 728. This was a decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit; the opinion being written by Circuit Judge Lurton, afterwards a Justice of this court. The question there considered was whether the owner of a patent for a machine for fastening buttons to shoes with metallic fasteners might sell such machines subject to the condition that they should be used only with fasteners manufactured by the seller, the patented machine to revert on the breach of the condition. The purchaser of the machine was held to be a licensee and the use by him of the unpatented fasteners contrary to the condition to be a breach of contract of the license and an infringement of the patent monopoly.\n A similar case came before this court and is reported in Henry v. Dick Co., 224 U. S. I. 32 S. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D. 880, the opinion in which was also delivered by Mr. Justice Lurton. In that case, a complainant sold his patented machine embodying his invention. It was called the 'rotary mimeograph.' The claims of the patent did not embrace ink or other materials used in working it. Upon the machine, however, was inscribed a notice, styled a license restriction, reciting that the machine might be used only with the stencil paper, ink, and other supplies made by the A. B. Dick Company. The Henry Company, dealers in ink, sold to the purchaser, for use in working her machine, ink not made by the Dick Company. This court held by a majority that the use of such ink by the purchaser was a prohibited use and rendered her liable to an action under the patent law for infringement, and that the seller of the ink was liable as a contributory infringer.\n The case was overruled by this court in the Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959. The patent in that case covered a part of the mechanism used in motion picture exhibiting machines for feeding a film through the machine with a regular uniform and accurate movement so as not to expose \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 493]\n\u00a0\n the film to excessive strain or west. The license agreement contained a covenant on the part of the licensee that every machine sold by it should be sold under the restriction and condition that such exhibiting or projecting machines should be used solely for exhibiting or projecting motion pictures of the Motion Picture Patents Company. The overruling of the Dick Case was based on the ground that the grant of the patent was of the exclusive right to use the mechanism and produce the result with any appropriate material and that the materials or pictures upon which the machine was operated were no part of the patented machine, or of the combination which produced the patented result.\n The overruling of the Dick Case and the disapproval of the Button- Fastener Case by the Motion Picture Film Case did not carry with it the overruling of Bement v. Harrow Co. The Button-Fastener Case was cited in the case of Bement v. Harrow Co. to sustain the decision there by what was an a fortiori argument. The ruling in the former case was much broader than was needed for the decision in the latter. The price at which a patented article sells is certainly a circumstance having a more direct relation and is more germane to the rights of the patentee than the unpatented material with which the patented article may be used. Indeed, as already said, price fixing is usually the essence of that which secures proper reward to the patentee.\n Nor do we think that the decisions of this court holding restrictions as to price of patented articles invalid apply to a contract of license like the one in this case. Those cases are: Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 \nU.S. 8\n, 38 S. Ct. 257, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 447; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 \nU.S. 490\n, 37 S. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 955; Bauer v. O'Donnell, \n229 \nU.S. 1\n, 33 S. Ct. 616, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150; Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S. Ct. 9; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n210 \nU.S. 339\n, 28 S. Ct. 722. These cases really are only instances of \n\n[272 U.S. 476, 494]\n\u00a0\n the application of the principle of Adams v. Burks, 17 Wall. 453, 456, already referred to that a patentee may not attach to the article made by him or with his consent a condition running with the article in the hands of purchasers limiting the price at which one who becomes its owner for full consideration shall part with it. They do not consider or condemn a restriction put by a patentee upon his licensee as to the prices at which the latter shall sell articles which he makes and only can make legally under the license. The authority of Bement v. Harrow Co. has not been shaken by the cases we have reviewed.\n For the reasons given, we sustain the validity of the license granted by the Electric Company to the Westinghouse Company. The decree of the District Court dismissing the bill is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. KATZ(1926)\nNo. 726\nArgued: March 11, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n Mr. William D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. Mahlon D. Kiefer, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Messrs. Wm. T. Connor, John R. K. Scott, and Benjamin M. Golder, all of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The two defendants in error in each of these cases were indicted in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a conspiracy to sell intoxicating liquors without making a permanent record of the sale, in violation of section 10, title 2 \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n of the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 312 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 e).\n The indictment in No. 726 charged that the defendant Katz conspired with the defendant Senn to sell for the Stewart Distilling Company to Senn a quantity of whisky, without making a record of the sale. A similar offense was charged against the defendants named in the indictment in No. 727.\n Demurrers and motions to quash were interposed to both indictments, on the ground that they failed to charge any crime. In support of this contention it was argued that section 10, which requires a permanent record to be made of sales of intoxicating liquors, applies only to persons authorized by the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et seq.) to sell alcoholic liquor, and that the indictment failed to allege that either of the defendants charged with making the sales, or the Stewart Distilling Company, held a permit, or was otherwise authorized to sell. The indictments were quashed by the District Court. 5 F.(2d) 527. The cases come here on writ of error to the District Court, under the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704).\n The overt act charged in each indictment was the sale of whisky by one defendant to the other. This is an offense under the National Prohibition Act; but as the defendants in each case were only one buyer and one seller, and as the agreement of the parties was an essential element in the sale, an indictment of the buyer and seller for a conspiracy to make the sale would have been of doubtful validity. Compare United States v. N. Y. C. & H. R. R. (C. C.) 146 F. 298; United States v. Dietrich (C. C.) 126 F. 664; Vannata v. United States (C. C. A.) 289 F. 424, 427. This embarrassment could be avoided in an indictment for a criminal conspiracy only if the buyer and seller were charged with conspiring to commit a substantive offense having an ingredient in addition to the sale, not requiring \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n the agreement of two persons for its completion. See Chadwick v. United States, 141 F. 225, 72 C. C. A. 343.\n Hence the government takes the position that the seller of intoxicating liquor is required by the statute to keep a permanent record of his sales, whether lawful or unlawful, and that failure to do so is itself a crime, from which it would follow that a conspiracy to effect a sale without such a record is an indictable offense. No question is made but that persons authorized to deal in alcoholic liquors under the Prohibition Act are required to make permanent records of their transactions. But the government, to support a charge of conspiracy applicable to buyer and seller, relies on the literal application of title 2,  10:\n'No person shall manufacture, purchase for sale, sell, or transport any liquor without making at the time a permanent record thereof showing in detail the amount and kind of liquor manufactured, purchased, sold, or transported. together with the names and addresses of the persons to whom sold, in case of sale, and the consignor and consignee in case of transportation, and the time and place of such manufacture, sale, or transportation. The Commissioner may prescribe the form of such record, which shall at all times be open to inspection as in this act provided.'\n\n Title 2,  34 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 u), provides:\n'All records and reports kept or filed under the provisions of this act shall be subject to inspection at any reasonable hour by the Commissioner or any of his agents or by any public prosecutor or by any person designated by him, or by any peace officer in the state where the record is kept, and copies of such records and reports duly certified by the person with whom kept or filed may be introduced in evidence with like effect as the originals thereof, and verified copies of such records shall be furnished to the Commissioner when called for.'\n\n To uphold the contention of the government, therefore, the language of section 10 must be taken to apply not \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n only to those who hold government permits authorizing them to deal in intoxicating liquors under a familiar system of regulation, to whom it admittedly is applicable, but to every criminal violator of the National Prohibition Act, even though making only a single, isolated sale. It must be taken also to extend the provisions of section 34, clearly applicable to such permittees, in such a way as to present the incongruity of a system of records to be kept by criminal violators of the act who are not permittees, in a form which the Commissioner may prescribe, which may be introduced in evidence on the certification of the person 'with whom kept,' and verified copies of which are to be furnished on demand, presumably by the criminal keeping the record.\n We are not now concerned with any question of legislative power to establish such a system but only with the question whether it was the intention of Congress to do so.\n All laws are to be given a sensible construction; and a literal application of a statute, which would lead to absurd consequences, should be avoided whenever a reasonable application can be given to it, consistent with the legislative purpose. See Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197, 212\n, 23 S. Ct. 787, and cases there cited. In ascertaining that purpose, we may examine the title of the act (United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 386; United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, States v. Saunders, 22 Wall. 492), the source in previous legislation of the particular provision in question (United Seates v. Saunders, 22 Wall. 492; Viterbo v. Friedlander, \n120 \nU.S. 707\n, 7 S. Ct. 962; United States v. Morrow, \n266 \nU.S. 531, 535\n, 45 S. Ct. 173), and the legislative scheme or plan by which the general purpose of the act is to be carried out. See Platt v. Union Pacific R. R., \n99 U.S. 48\n, 63-64; Bernier v. Bernier, \n147 \nU.S. 242, 246\n, 13 S. Ct. 244.\n One purpose of the National Prohibition Act was to suppress the entire traffic in intoxicating liquor as a bev- \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n erage. Grogan v. Walker & Sons, \n259 \nU.S. 80, 89\n, 42 S. Ct. 423, 22 A. R. L. 1116. But the Eighteenth Amendment did not prohibit the use of intoxicating liquor for other than beverage purposes, and an important purpose of the act, as its title1 and contents show, was to regulate the manufacture, tansportation, and use of intoxicating liquor for other than beverage purposes.\n Section 3, title 2 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 aa) which prohibits the manufacture, sale, and possession of intoxicating liquor, expressly provides that:\n'Liquor for nonbeverage purposes and wine for sacramental purposes may be manufactured, purchased, sold bartered, transported, imported, exported, delivered, furnished and possessed, but only as herein provided, and the commissioner may, upon application, issue permits therefor. ...'\n\n To make the prohibitions of the act effective, and to provide for the production and use of liquor for nonbeverage purposes, it became necessary for the government to regulate and supervise those uses of intoxicating liquor which were not prohibited. Congress had before it the provisions of the Revenue Law (Comp. Stat. 1916,  5981 to 6161) governing distillers, rectifiers, and brewers, requiring detailed records of all transactions, and laying down other regulations designed to promote the effective collection of liquor taxes; it also had before it the regulatory system devised by the Internal Revenue Bureau for carrying into effect the prohibitory legislation contained in the Food Control Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 e-3115 1\/8 kk, 3115 1\/8 l-3115 1\/8 r), and subsequent war legislation. See 21 T. D. 7, No. 2788\n\n\n The business affected by this legislation was lawful business, subject to governmental regulation; records of \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n transactions were required to be kept, as a condition of receiving government permission to operate, and such records were a convenient and necessary means for protecting the interests of the government with respect to its revenues. When Congress came to enact the National Prohibition Act, a similar method of permit or license and a similar system of records afforded a convenient means for the regulation and control of those dealing with alcoholic liquors for the nonbeverage purposes as authorized by the statute.\n The reports of the committees of the Senate and House having the bill in charge, as well as the statute as adopted, indicate clearly that the purpose of Congress was to take over an established and well-known system of granting permits and requiring reports and records, for the purpose of regulating and controlling such portion of the liquor traffic as had not been prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment and the National Prohibition Act. \n2\n The \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n report of the Senate Committee is also persuasive that the provisions of title 2,  34, already quoted, relating to 'all records and reports kept or filed under the provisions of this act,' refer to records and reports required of permittees. 3 Nowhere in the reports of the committees does it appear that any such novel legislation was being proposed as is here contended for by the government. On the contrary, it is stated in the report of the House Judiciary Committee, page 7, that:\n'Title 2 for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment has in it no new or experimental features. Every provision in it has precedents in state or federal legislation.'\n\n The government does not suggest that there is in fact any precedent in \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n legislation, state or national, for the interpretation which it urges here.\n Of the 39 sections in title 2 of the act, which deals with national prohibition, more than half, including the 7 sections which precede section 10, contain provisions authorizing or regulating the manufacture, sale, transportation, or use of intoxicating liquor for nonbeverage purposes. \n4\n These provisions, read together, clearly indicate a statutory plan or scheme to regulate the disposition \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n of alcoholic liquor not prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment, in such manner as to minimize the danger of its diversion from authorized or permitted uses to beverage purposes. These provisions plainly relate to those persons who are authorized to sell, transport, use or possess intoxicating liquors under the Eighteenth Amendment and the provision of section 3 of the act, already quoted.\n No section of the act requiring records to be made of dealings in alcoholic liquors relates to any but dealings authorized or permitted under the statute, unless it be section 10. The question is thus presented, whether the requirement of section 10 that 'no person shall ... sell ... liquor without making at the time a permanent record thereof' is a regulatory measure applicable to persons authorized to deal in nonbeverage liquors, or whether it was intended to add to the crime of manufacturing, selling or transporting, a second offense, whenever the person committing the crime should fail to make a record of his own wrongdoing. When the statute is read as a whole, and the implications of the latter interpretation are taken into account, we think that it is not a reasonable or a fairly admissible interpretation.\n General terms descriptive of a class of persons made subject to a criminal statute may and should be limited, where the literal application of the statute would lead to extreme or absurd results, and where the legislative purpose gathered from the whole act would be satisfied by a more limited interpretation. United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, supra; United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482; United States v. Palmer, supra.\n In United States v. Palmer, the defendants, not citizens of the United States, were indicted for a robbery committed on a foreign vessel on the high seas, under a statute which provided that, 'if any person or persons shall com- \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 363]\n\u00a0\n mit, upon the high seas, ... out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, murder or robbery, ...' such offender should be guilty of piracy and punishable with death. Chief Justice Marshall pointed out that Congress, under its constitutional power to define and punish piracy, had authority to make a statute applicable to the defendants; but, applying the principle of statutory construction to which we have referred, he held that the words 'any person or persons,' although broad enough to comprehend every human being, could not, in view of the exceptional consequences of a literal application, and the intent of the Legislature, as derived from the title of the act and a reading of the whole statute, be construed to apply to persons, not citizens, who committed offenses on foreign vessels on the high seas.\n In United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, supra, the defendant was indicted for a conspiracy 'to have in ... possession' of another person, not registered, a quantity of opium, in violation of the Opium Registration Act of 1914 (Comp. St.  6287g-6287q), which declared it unlawful for 'any person,' who had not registered and paid the prescribed tax, to have in his possession or control any of the drug in question. This court held that the words 'any person not registered' could not be taken to apply to any person in the United States, but must be read, in harmony with the purpose of the act, to refer to persons required by law to register.\n We think the reasoning of these cases applicable here, and that the words 'no person' in section 10 refer to persons authorized under other provisions of the act to carry on traffic in alcoholic liquors. It is not without significance that the Commissioner has never made any regulation with respect to records of bootlegging transactions, and that the published regulations contain no suggestion that section 10 has any application, except to persons who hold permits, or are otherwise authorized by law to traffic in intoxi- \n\n[271 U.S. 354, 364]\n\u00a0\n cating liquor.

It is the most effective means to insure obedience to the law and prevents the diversion of liquor for illegal purposes. It is a slight burden on the law-abiding citizens who are dealing in liquor for legal purposes.'\n\n Report No. 91, part 1, of the House Judiciary Committee, June 30, 1919, to accompany H. R. 6810, contains the following statement on page 2:\n'Title 2, to enforce prohibition under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, contains substantially the same features at title 1 and in addition a system of permits such as is now in force under regulations of the Revenue Department, Treasury Decision 2788, and in the various prohibition codes. These permits are designed to prevent diversion of liquor from legal to illegitimate uses. This system greatly lessens prosecution by making it difficult for persons to obtain liquor except for legitimate purposes. In addition to the permit system, which is also provided for in title 3 (the industrial alcohol section) the act carries a number of the more essential penal provisions of the ordinary prohibition codes, such as those against advertising liquor.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Senate Report, pages 7, 8, contains the following statement with reference to the provisions of the present section 34 of the National Prohibition Act:\n'The requirement of section 35 (now 34)-that the Commissioner file all the reports, statements, and information required by title II as a part of the files of his office, in a permanent record, alphabetically arranged, with an indorsement showing the date when filed, etc., and to furnish certified copies of such reports, statements, and information to any person requesting the same-is deemed by the committee an unnecessary requirement, and one which will result in cumbering the office of the commissioner with reports, information, and data which would serve no useful purpose; that for all practical purposes it will be sufficient if all records and reports kept on file under the provisions of the act shall be subject to inspection by the Commissioner or any of his agents, or by any public prosecutor or any person designated by him, and that copies of such records and reports, duly certified, may be introduced in evidence with like effect as the originals thereof. The committee has amended section 35 (now 34) accordingly. Section 10, it will be observed, authorizes the Commissioner to prescribe the form of the permanent record to be made by the manufacturer, purchaser, seller, or transporter of any liquor, and requires that such permanent record be at all times open to inspection by the Commissioner or his agents.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The following examples may be noted:\n Section 4 exempts from the operation of the act denatured alcohol, medicinal and toilet preparations, etc. It authorizes the manufacture of these articles and the purchase and possession of alcoholic liquors for that purpose under government permit, and requires the manufacturer to 'keep the records, and make the reports specified in this act and as directed by the Commissioner.'\n Section 5 provides for the revocation of permits, if the product manufactured does not comply with the requirements of section 4.\n Section 6 prohibits the sale, purchase, transportation, or prescription of liquor without a permit from the Commissioner, issued as prescribed in the section, except the purchase and use for medicinal purposes and for the treatment of alcoholism. This section also exempts sacramental wines from the provisions of the act, except as to the requirements of section 6 for permits (save for purchase) and to the requirements of section 10 for the keeping of records.\n Section 7 authorizes physicians to prescribe liquor under government permit and requires a record of such prescriptions.\n Section 9 authorizes proceedings for the revocation of permits for the violation of the act, and section 27 provides that seized liquor may, under order of the court, be ordered sold to persons holding permits to purchase.\n Section 11 requires manufacturers and wholesale or retail druggists, to keep, as part of the records required of them a copy of all permits to purchase on which sales are made, and prohibits them from selling except to persons having permits to purchase.\n Section 12 requires manufacturers of liquor for sale to attach to every package a label describing its contents.\n Section 13 makes it the duty of every carrier to make a record at the place of shipment of the receipt of any liquor transported, and section 14 requires the packages carried to be labeled in a specified way. \n\n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Sewall Key, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. John J. Healy, of Chicago, Ill., for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 633, 636]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 3, 1924, defendants in error were indicted under section 37 of the Criminal Code (35 Stat. 1088, 1096 (Comp. St. 10201)) for conspiracy to defraud the United States in respect of its internal revenue. It is charged that they conspired to make a false income and profits tax return for 1920 for the Freeman Coal Mining Company, and that they caused \n\n[272 U.S. 633, 637]\n\u00a0\n a false return to be prepared, sworn to and filed, and committed various other overt acts. But an act is alleged to have been done later than March 14, 1921, more than three years prior to the indictment. Each of the defendants interposed a plea that the prosecution was barred because not commenced within three years after the offense. The district court, being of opinion that the applicable period of limitation had expired, entered judgment sustaining the pleas and discharging the defendants. The case is here under Criminal Appeals Act, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704). United States v. Barber, \n219 \nU.S. 72\n, 31 S. Ct. 209.\n The question for decision is whether the applicable period is three years fixed by section 1044, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1708), or six years specified in a proviso added by the Act of November 17, 1921, c. 124, 42 Stat. 220 (Comp. St.  1708).\n It is necessary to consider a number of statutory provisions. Section 1044 provides:\n'No person shall be prosecuted, ... for any offense, not capital, except as provided in section 1046, unless the indictment is found, or the information is instituted, within three years next after such offense shall have been committed. ...'\n\n The defendants insist that the foregoing provision applies. The government contends that the case is covered by the proviso:\n'Provided, however, that in offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner, and now indictable under any existing statutes, the period of limitation shall be six years.'\n\n And the proviso was made applicable to offenses theretofore committed and not already barred.\n Section 1046 (Comp. St.  1710) provides:\n'No person shall be prosecuted, ... for any crime arising under the revenue laws, or the slave trade laws of the United States, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within five years next after the committing of such crime.'\n\n Act July 5, 1884, c. 225, 23 Stat. 122 (Comp. St.  1711), provides:\n'That no person shall be prosecuted, ... for any of the \n\n[272 U.S. 633, 638]\n\u00a0\n various offenses arising under the internal revenue laws of the United States unless the indictment is found or the information instituted within three years next after the commission of the offense, in all cases where the penalty prescribed may be imprisonment in the penitentiary and within two years in all other cases. ...'\n\n This act was amended by section 1321 of the Revenue Act of 1921, approved November 23, 1921 (42 Stat. 315, c. 136 (Comp. St.  1711)), which eliminated the two-year period so as to make the three-year period apply to all offenses. And it was further amended by section 1010(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, approved June 2, 1924 (43 Stat. 341, c. 234 (Comp. St.  1711)), which added the same proviso that was added to section 1044. This latest amendment, passed after the offense here charged applied the six-year period to offenses thereafter committed against the internal revenue laws and covered by the proviso.\n The offense charged is a conspiracy and not one arising under the internal revenue laws; and it is not within the Act of July 5, 1884, as amended. The period applicable is either three years under section 1044 or six years under the proviso. The government argues that defrauding the United States is an ingredient of the crime charged, and that the six-year period applies. It relies on United States v. Noveck, \n271 \nU.S. 201\n, 46 S. Ct. 476. But that case is not like this one. The question there involved was whether an allegation in an indictment for perjury ( section 125, Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10295)), that the crime was committed for the 'purpose of defrauding the United States,' took the case out of the general clause of section 1044. We held that the purpose stated was not an element of perjury as defined by statute, and that the extraneous fact alleged did not bring the case within the proviso. When the opinion is read in the light of the issue presented and decided, it furnishes no support for the government's contention here.\n The proper application of the proviso is to be found upon a consideration of its scope as compared with that \n\n[272 U.S. 633, 639]\n\u00a0\n of the original section having regard to the other statutes of limitation. Section 1044 is comprehensive in language and purpose; it relates to all crimes, excepting only capital offenses and those arising under the revenue laws and slave trade laws. The purpose of the added proviso was to carve out a special class of cases. It is to be construed strictly, and held to apply only to cases shown to be clearly within its purpose. United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 165; Ryan v. Carter, \n93 U.S. 78\n, 83.\n The proviso relates to substantive offenses involving defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States, whether committed by one or more or by conspiracy or otherwise. It does not extend to any offenses not covered by section 1044. The crime of conspiracy to commit an offense is distinct from the offense itself. The language of the proviso cannot reasonably be read to include all conspiracies defined by section 37. But if the proviso could be construed to include any conspiracies, obviously it would be limited to those to commit the substantive offenses which it covers. All the various offenses under the internal revenue laws are excepted from section 1044. The proviso relates to the preceding part of the section and can have no broader scope. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat, 1, 30. And legislation contemporaneous with and subsequent to its passage shows that Congress intended that the proviso should not include such offenses. The proviso and section 1321 were considered by Congress at the same time. The latter was enacted six days after the proviso; it relates exclusively to offenses under the internal revenue laws. That section is to be applied rather than the general language of the proviso added to a statute that never covered such offenses. And section 1010(a) which prescribes for them the same limitations as are fixed by the proviso, was unnecessary if the proviso already applied.\n The three-year period fixed by section 1044 is applicable, and defendants' pleas were rightly sustained.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","202":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

C., and William H. Bonneville, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[270 U.S. 521, 522]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hal H. Smith, of Detroit, Mich. (Mr. Thomas B. Moore, of Detroit, Mich., of counsel), for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case on its facts is similar to that ofUnited States v. P. Koenig Coal Co., 46 S. Ct. 392, \n270 U.S. 512\n, just decided. \n\n[270 U.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n The indictment against the Cement Company embraces 15 counts, and each count shows that the Cement Company, with the assistance of the Bewley Darst Coal Company, while Service Order No. 23 of the Interstate Commerce Commission was in force, obtained a billing and consignment of cars of coal by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company from a mine in Kentucky to the Municipal Light & Power Company at Four Mile Lake in Michigan, where the coal was delivered in accordance with direction and was appropriated by the Cement Company for its use; that the building and the preference were granted by the carrier company on the assumption that the coal was to be delivered and used by a public utility company, which was in class No. 2 under Order No. 23, instead of class No. 5, in which coal for making cement was embraced. The District Court sustained the demurrer to this indictment on the same ground as in the Koenig Case, that the Elkins Act requires the collusion of the carrier with the shipper and the carrier's conscious violation of law in the concession granted, and that when this is negatived in the indictment the indictment must fail. That ground we have held to be without weight in the Koenig Case. It was the only one pressed on us.\n In this case the counsel for the defendant advances in his brief and argument two other grounds raised by the demurrer on which he contends the indictment should have been held bad. One of them is that section 1 of the Elkins Act (Comp. St. s 8597), under which the indictment is found, must be limited to a concession or discrimination which violates a tariff published and filed by a carrier, that as a rebate without such tariff is not unlawful within that section, so a concession or discrimination is not. The contention is that the published tariff should have indicated that the order of distribution of cars should be as Order 23 requires. \n\n[270 U.S. 521, 524]\n\u00a0\n The Elkins Act does not require such a tariff as to any other advantage or discrimination than a rebate. It declares to be an offense any device whereby transportation shall be given at any less rate than named in the published tariff 'or whereby any other advantage is given or discrimination is practiced.' Where the offense consists in a rebate, as that term is usually understood, to wit, transportation at a less rate in dollars and cents than the published rate which the shipping public are charged, a published tariff is, of course, necessary to constitute the standard, departure from which is the crime. Where there is no pecuniary reduction of the rates as published, and the tariff is complied with but the law against favoritism and discrimination is infringed by the making of a concession or the granting of an advantage not specifically measured in dollars and cents, reference to a published tariff is unnecessary There is nothing in the statute that indicates the necessity of a published tariff which should expressly recite the fact that no unfair or unequal concession or advantage in the distribution of coal cars to shippers, or in the priority of their shipment, should be afforded. The fact that the advantage or discrimination is unlawful is plain from the description of its character, as shown in this indictment without reference to the rates fixed in the tariff. See Lambert Run Coal Co. v. B. & O. R. R., 42 S. Ct. 349, \n258 U.S. 377\n, 378. Such a published tariff seems not to have been present in C., C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Hirsch, 204 F. 849, 123 C. C. A. 145, and in Central of Georgia Ry. v. Blount, 238 F. 292, 151 C. C. A. 308, in which leases of property by carriers to shippers at inadequate rentals were held to be unlawful concessions. Nor in Vandalia Railway v. United States, 226 F. 713, 141 C. C. A. 469, where a loan by a carrier to shipping interests at less than market rate was held to be an unlawful concession. Nor in Northern Central Railway v. United States, 241 F. 25, 154 C. C. A. 25, where the waiving of royalties for the use of coal lands leased to \n\n[270 U.S. 521, 525]\n\u00a0\n shipping interests was held to be an unlawful concession. Nor in Dye v. United States (C. C. A.) 262 F. 6, in which the agent of a railway company who secured an excessive number of cars for one of a great number of mines between which, by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in an emergency, cars were to be distributed according to a rule, was convicted under the Elkins Act, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the conviction.\n Service Order No. 23 herein was issued under the Transportation Act and had the force of law. Avent v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 34, \n266 U.S. 127\n, 131; United States v. Grimaud, 31 S. Ct. 480, \n220 U.S. 506\n. In the absence of a specific requirement for its publication in a tariff either in the act authorizing the service order, or in the Elkins Act, we can find no reason for making it essential in the enforcement of the statute, and no case is cited to suggest one.\n The other ground urged by counsel for the defendant is, if we understand it, that paragraph 15 of section 402 of the Transportation Act ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 8563) did not authorize and delegate to the Interstate Commerce Commission the fixing of preference and priorities in transportation, that paragraph 7 of the Commission's order prescribed classes of purposes and order or classes only with respect to car service, and made no rule applicable to the transportation of coal for different classes of purposes and different order of classes, that car service does not include transportation, and that the defendant here is indicted for securing a concession in transportation by which he obtained an improper class under a classification which the Commission therefore had no authority to make and which it did not in fact require. We think the argument does not give proper effect to paragraph 15 and the words and significance of the service order. By paragraph 15 the Commission is authorized, first, to suspend the operation of any or all rules, regulations or practices then established with respect to car service for such time as may be determined \n\n[270 U.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n by the Commission; second, to make such just and reasonable directions with respect to car service without regard to the ownership as between the carriers of cars, during such emergency as in its opinion will best promote the service in the interest of the public and the commerce of the people; and, third, to give directions for preference or priority in transportation, embargoes, or movement of traffic under permit and for such periods as it may determine, and to modify, change, suspend or annul them. The service order, after reciting the emergency, directs each common carrier east of the Mississippi river to the extent to which it is unable promptly to transport all freight traffic, to give preference and priority to coal, to give preference and priority to the movement, exchange and return of empty coal cars, to furnish coal mines with certain classes of cars, to require that noncoal loading carriers deliver empty coal cars to the maximum ability of each, to enable the connecting coal loading companies to receive and use the coal cars so delivered for the preferential purposes set forth in the order; to discontinue the use of coal cars for the transportation of commodities other than coal during the order, to place an embargo on the receipt by any consignee of coal in suitable cars who shall fail or refuse to unload the coal seasonably; and finally, in the supply of cars to mines, to place, furnish and assign coal mines with cars suitable for the loading and transportation of coal for certain classes of consignees, and in a certain order, forbidding reconsignment or diversion. It seems to us clear that the order of the Commission affects the furnishing of cars, their loading, their consignment and thus necessarily their movement in transportation and corresponds fully with the powers conferred by paragraph 15; and that paragraph 15 and Service Order No. 23 both apply not only to priority of car service but also to that of transportation. Certainly one who secures reconsignment and diversion from a lower to a higher class of consignees for delivery violates the service order in terms. \n\n[270 U.S. 521, 527]\n\u00a0\n In urging this objection to the Indictment, reliance is had by defendant upon the opinion of this court in the case of Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 194, \n263 U.S. 528\n. There the Interstate Commerce Commission sought under paragraph 15 to compel a terminal carrier to switch, by its own engines and over its own tracks, freight cars tendered by or for another connecting carrier. It was held that the exercise of the emergency power of the Commission in transferring car equipment from one carrier to the use of another under paragraph 15 was strictly to be construed, and that the provision as to car service did not authorize the Commission to impose upon the terminal carrier, without a hearing, the affirmative duty not only of turning over its cars and equipment to another carrier, as contemplated in paragraph 15, but also that of itself doing the work of the transportation of and for another carrier. It was in this connection that this court used the expression that car service connotes the use to which vehicles of transportation are put, but not the transportation service rendered by means of them. The opinion expressly affirms the authority of the Commission under paragraph 15 to give regulatory directions for preference or priority in transportation. The language of this court in the Peoria Case referred to is of no aid to the defendant here.\n The judgment is reversed. \n\n\n\n","203":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. MITCHELL(1926)\nNo. 470\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 9, 10]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Messrs. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and A. W. Gregg and T. H. Lewis, Jr., both of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Messrs. A. L. Humes and Stafford Smith, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n November 28, 1918, Dellora R. Gates, a resident of Texas, died testate, and January 6, 1919, the county court of Jefferson county granted letters testamentary to appellees. The federal estate tax accrued one year after her death, and, November 26, 1919, the executors made a return showing $2,927,762.64 due the United States under the Revenue Act of 1916. 1 They did not pay any part of the tax in 1919, but paid $1,000,000 February 25, 1920, and the balance May 27, of that year. Under the Revenue Act of 1918,2 the executors, March 14, 1920, made an income tax return for the estate for 1919 showing a balance due of $905,225.73. If the estate tax had been \n\n[271 U.S. 9, 11]\n\u00a0\n deducted, there would have been no taxable income for that year. In 1919, the executors paid an inheritance tax of $357,739.34, which was imposed and became due in that year under the laws of Texas. \n3\n If that amount had been deducted, the income tax of the estate for that year would have been reduced by $261,149.72. When the return was made, the rulings and regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Secretary of the Treasury did not permit the deduction of the federal estate tax or the state inheritance tax, and for that reason the executors did not claim that either should be deducted, and paid the amount shown by the return. After the decision of this court in United States v. Woodward (1921) 41 S. Ct. 615, \n256 U.S. 632\n, the executors filed a claim for refund which was denied. The Bureau of Internal Revenue offered to allow them to deduct the estate tax paid in 1920 from gross income, in calculating the income tax on the estate, for that year. The executors refused to do so and brought this action in which they seek to recover the full amount of the 1919 income tax paid. And, in the event that the estate tax shall be held not deductible, they seek to recover $261,149.72, the amount by which the income tax would have been lessened if the Texas inheritance tax paid in that year had been deducted. The Court of Claims held the estate tax deductible, and gave judgment for the full amount.\n It is established that, in calculating the income tax on an estate during administration under Revenue Act 1918,  214(a)(3), federal estate taxes are deductible. United States v. Woodward, supra. But the question presented by this case is whether in calculating the income tax for 1919, the executors were entitled to deduct from the gross income actually received in that year the estate \n\n[271 U.S. 9, 12]\n\u00a0\n tax which was not paid until 1920. The executors maintain that under section 214(a)(3) estate taxes are deductible if paid or if accrued within the taxable year, and that the estate tax, accruing in 1919 and paid in 1920, was deductible from gross income actually received in 1919. When regard is had to other provisions of the act, it is clear that this contention is not admissible. Section 200 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 a) declares that 'paid' means 'paid or accrued,' and that the phrase 'paid or accrued' shall be construed according to the method of accounting upon the basis on which the net income is computed under section 212 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 f). And section 212 provides that net income shall be computed on the basis of the taxpayer's annual accounting period in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of the taxpayer (United States v. Anderson, 46 S. Ct. 131, \n269 U.S. 422\n), but if no such method has been employed, or if the method employed does not reflect the income, the computation shall be made upon a basis and in a manner that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, does clearly reflect the income. The return shows that it was made on the basis of income actually received in 1919. This indicates that the accounts were kept on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, and there is nothing in the record to show that any other method was employed. The burden is on the executors to establish the invalidity of the tax. United States v. Anderson, supra. They have not shown that their books were kept on the accrual basis. Assuming, as we must, that the accounts of the estate were kept on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, the executors were required to make return on that basis. Notwithstanding the option given taxpayers, it is the purpose of the Act to require returns that clearly reflect taxable income. That purpose will not be accomplished unless income received and deductible disbursements made are treated consistently. It was not the purpose of the Act to permit gross income actually \n\n[271 U.S. 9, 13]\n\u00a0\n received to be diminished by taxes or other deductible items disbursed in a later year, even if accrued in the taxable year. It is a reasonable construction of the law that the same method be applied to both sides of the account.\n Appellees contend that United States v. Woodward, supra, governs this case. The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916 and of the Revenue Act of 1918 which are here involved were considered in that case. The cases are much alike. Woodward died December 15, 1917, and the estate tax became due one year later, but it was not paid until February 8, 1919. It may be assumed that the return for 1918 included only the income actually received in that year. The rules and regulations then in force did not permit the deduction of the estate tax. If that deduction had been made there would have been no taxable income. The executors paid the tax under duress, and brought suit for the amount paid. The Court of Claims held them entitled to recover, and this court affirmed the judgment. The question considered and decided was whether in ascertaining net taxable income the estate tax was deductible. The opinion referred to the provision which imposes the tax upon incomes of estates and that part of section 214 which authorizes the deduction of 'taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year imposed (a) by the authority of the United States, except income, war profits and excess profits taxes,' and, in discussing the clause defining the deductions permitted to be made, the court said ( page 634 (41 S. Ct. 616)):\n'The words of its major clause are comprehensive and include every tax which is charged against the estate by the authority of the United States. The excepting clause specifially enumerates what is to be excepted. The implication from the latter is that the taxes which it enumerates would be within the major clause were they not expressly excepted, and also that there was no purpose to except any others. Estate taxes \n\n[271 U.S. 9, 14]\n\u00a0\n were as well known at the time the provision was framed as the ones particularly excepted. ... Thus their omission from the excepting clause means that Congress did not intend to except them. The act of 1916 calls the estate tax a 'tax' and particularly denominates it an 'estate tax.' This court recently has recognized that it is a duty or excise and is imposed in the exertion of the taxing power of the United States. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner (41 S. Ct. 506, \n256 U.S. 345\n, 16 A. L. R. 660).'\n\n The question decided concerned the character of the exaction; that is, whether the so-called federal 'estate taxes' were 'taxes' within the meaning of that word as used in the clause of section 214 quoted. The government did not contend that, if deductible at all, the estate taxes could not be deducted in that case because the return was made on the basis of income actually received in 1918, whereas the estate tax, accruing in that year, was not paid until 1919. That question was not presented to the court for decision, and no such question was considered or decided. It is not to be thought that a question not raised by counsel or discussed in the opinion of the court has been decided merely because it existed in the record and might have been raised and considered. Webster v. Fall, 45 S. Ct. 148, \n266 U.S. 507\n, 511. The Woodward Case does not support the contention that, where the estate income tax return is made on the basis of income actually received in the taxable year, there may be deducted the estate tax accruing in that year but paid in the following year.\n It remains to be considered whether, in calculating the tax on the income of the estate, the inheritance tax imposed by the law of Texas and paid by appellees in 1919 is deductible from the gross income received in that year. That law provides that all property, which shall pass by will or by the laws of descent, shall upon passing to or for the use of any person (with certain exceptions) be subject to a tax for the benefit of the state. We are of \n\n[271 U.S. 9, 15]\n\u00a0\n opinion that, in respect of the matter under consideration, the Texas inheritance tax law cannot be distinguished from the New York transfer tax law; and that under Keith v. Johnson, 46 S. Ct. 415, 70 L. Ed. -,1 decided this day, the executors are entitled to have the inheritance tax paid in 1919 deducted from the income of the estate received in that year.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 201, Act Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, title II, 39 Stat. 756, 777, as amended by Act March 3, 1917, c. 159, title III,  300, 39 Stat. 1000, 1002 (Comp.

Y., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of New York, by its superintendent of public works in a complaint filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, sought to compel the New York Central Railroad Company to provide transportation service between the public terminal of the Erie Barge Canal at Buffalo and shippers located along its tracks and along the lines of other railroads with which it can interchange traffic. The service demanded included the furnishing of rolling stock, motive power, and the placing and removal of cars on the tracks within the terminal, incident to moving traffic between the terminal and appellee's lines. The jurisdiction of the Commission was invoked under section 6, par. 13, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Panama Canal Act, August 24, 1912, c. 390, 37 Stat. 568, and sections 412, 413, Transportation Act, February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 483 (Comp. St.  8569, 8570).1 \n\n[272 U.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n A similar application had been made to the Public Service Commission of New York (Second District). The order of the commission granting this relief was vacated by the state Supreme Court on the ground that the traffic \n\n[272 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n concerned was interstate in character, jurisdiction over which under the statutes already cited was in the Interstate Commerce Commission.

E. 590.\n In the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, two barge carriers, neither of which had filed rates with it or the Public Service Commission of New York, intervened and were made parties on their petitions setting forth that the interchange of traffic sought to be established by complainant was essential to their business.\n After a full hearing the commission granted the relief sought. State of New York v. New York Central R. R., 95 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 119. The railroad company then filed a bill in equity in the District Court for northern New York to enjoin the enforcement of the Commission's order. The case was heard on the record of the Interstate Commerce Commission proceedings by the District Court, three judges sitting (Urgent Deficiencies Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 220; Lambert Co. v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., \n258 \nU.S. 377\n, 42 S. Ct. 349), which granted the injunction (13 F. (2d) 200). The case comes here by direct appeal. Urgent Deficiencies Act, supra.\n The state of New York built, owns, and controls the Erie Barge Canal and terminals, wharves, and docks used in connection with it, including the Erie Basin terminal at Buffalo. The canal extends eastwardly from Buffalo by a circuitous route to the Hudson river and has several branches. The state does not own barges or rolling stock; nor does it transport merchandise or operate the canal, but it maintains this waterway with its facilities open to free public use. About 75 per cent. of the traffic passing over it is interstate.\n The Erie Basin terminal, having an area of 9.25 acres, is located on the harbor of Buffalo, adjacent to the right of \n\n[272 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n way of the railroad company. It includes two concrete piers with equipment for loading and unloading freight, and five thousand feet of railway track, with sidings, switches and storage tracks. There is a physical connection by switching tracks between the terminal and appellee's lines, which was made in 1919 under a contract between the Director General of Railroads and the state of New York. The New York Central's main road between Buffalo and New York City parallels the barge canal and serves important points reached by it or its connections. The effect of appellee's refusal to perform the transportation service ordered by the Commission is to preclude the interchange of traffic between rail carriers and barge canal carriers at Buffalo, and incidentally to avoid the diversion to the canal of a substantial amount of traffic now passing over the lines of the railroad company to and from industries located along its right of way.\n In granting the injunction, the District Court disregarded the intervention of the two canal carriers on the ground that they were not shown to be engaged in interstate commerce. Section 6, par. 13, of the amended Interstate Commerce Act, in so far as it confers authority on the Commission to order the operation of the connecting tracks and to determine the sum to be 'paid to or by either carrier,' was construed to require the presence of two carriers before the Commission subject to its jurisdiction. It therefore held that the Commission was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, because there were not two carriers before it, and, further, that the complainant, a sovereign state, as owner of the terminal, but not a carrier, was beyond its regulatory powers, and presumably could not invoke its jurisdiction.\n We lay to one side the question whether the interveners, within the meaning of these acts, are carriers of property which 'may be or is transported from point to point in \n\n[272 U.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n the United States ... not entirely within the limits of a single state.' Nor need we consider to what extent, if at all, the state of New York, in the event of its failure to maintain its tracks or facilities, is beyond the regulatory or coercive power of the Commission as asserted below. Cf. Georgia v. Chattanooga, \n264 \nU.S. 472\n, 44 S. Ct. 369; Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 907.\n The jurisdiction of the commission in this case was properly invoked. A state, when its interests are concerned, as well as a private individual, whether carrier or not, may file a complaint with the commission. Interstate Commerce Act,  13, as amended by Act June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 550 (Comp. St.  8581). Moreover a complaint is not a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Commission. It may of its own motion investigate and act upon any matter which may be the subject of complaint (with exceptions not now relevant). Section 13, par. 2, Interstate Commerce Act, as amended; Panama Canal Act, supra, 37 Stat. p. 568. Hence the only question that need be considered here is the power of the Commission, assuming there was but one carrier before it, to issue the order now attacked.\n The Panama Canal Act is by its terms supplemental to the Act to Regulate Commerce, and its obvious purpose was to extend to rail carriers connecting with water carriers in interstate commerce the requirements of section 1, par. 9 of the earlier acts (chapter 3591, 34 Stat. 585, 586; chapter 309, 36 Stat. 547 (Comp. St.  8563)), for furnishing switching and car service to lateral branch railroads and private side tracks. By section 6, par. 13, so far as pertinent to the present inquiry, the Commission is given authority to establish physical connection between the lines of the rail carrier and the dock of the water carrier, and to determine and prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the connecting tracks should be operated. It 'may either in the construction or the operation of such tracks determine what sums shall be paid to or by either carrier.' \n\n[272 U.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n We may assume without deciding that the Commission may not determine the amount to be paid to or by either carrier concerned without having both before it. But the Commission is not required by the terms of the statute to make such a determination and here it did not do so. A determination with respect to construction costs was not necessary since the physical connection had already been established. There could be no need for directing a contribution of operating expenses since the rail carrier was ordered to furnish the entire car service. It was free to establish such rates as it deemed reasonable, subject to review by the Commission if necessary. The only parties concerned in the order actually made were those before the Commission: appellee, which was required to furnish the service, and the state of New York, whose terminal facilities were thus to be used. To have required the presence of one or more canal carriers before the Commission for the purpose of making this order would have been an idle ceremony. The construction of the act contended for is unwarranted by its language and incompatible with its purpose to create an administrative body with authority to facilitate the interchange of interstate traffic between rail and water carriers, by a less formal procedure than prevails in courts of law. We conclude that the Commission had authority to make the order and that its findings were supported by the evidence.\n We have fully considered other objections to the order but only one is of sufficient moment to require mention. It is argued that the jurisdiction conferred by section 6, par. 13, is limited to interstate transportation while the order directs transportation of both interstate and intrastate traffic. By the terms of this section, the Commission is given jurisdiction both of the transportation described and of the carriers, rail and water, engaged in such transportation. By definition, transportation includes '... all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, \n\n[272 U.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n irrespective of ownership ... and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, ... and transfer in transit, ... and handling of property transported.' Section 1, par. 3, Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act,  400 (41 Stat. at pages 474, 475 (Comp. St .  8563)).\n The Commission having jurisdiction over the carriers and the facilities by which the transportation is carried on, the question is narrowed to whether its jurisdiction extends to the entire current of commerce flowing through this terminal although intrastate in part. When we consider the nature and extent of the commingling of interstate and intrastate commerce, and the difficulty of segregating the freight passing through the terminal, we think it clear that Congress in employing such broad language as 'the Commission shall have full authority to determine and prescribe the terms and conditions upon which these connecting tracks shall be operated' intended to confer upon the Commission power to regulate the entire stream of commerce. Where as here interstate and intrastate transactions are interwoven, the regulation of the latter is so incidental to and inseparable from the regulation of the former as properly to be deemed included in the authority over interstate commerce conferred by statute. This was the view of the state court. People ex rel. New York Central R. R. v. Public Service Commission, supra. Cf. State of Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S.

Matthews, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error was indicted November 5, 1923. The first count alleges the commission of perjury on March 13, 1920-more than three years before indictment. The District Court quashed that count on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. The case is here under the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704).\n The count charges 'the crime of perjury as defined by section 125 of the United States Criminal Code.' That section provides:\n'Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, shall willfully and contrary to such oath state or subscribe any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury. ...' 35 Stat. 1088, 1111 (Comp. St.  10295).\n\n The substance of the charge is that defendant in error on oath stated that the income tax due from S. Noveck & Co., Inc., for 1919, was $1,484. 84 on an income of $16,251.66, whereas in fact the tax due was $45,664.91 on an income of $124,127.13. And it is alleged that the perjury was committed 'for the purpose of defrauding the United States.'\n Section 1044 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of November 17, 1921, c. 124, 42 Stat. 220 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1708 ), provides:\n'No person shall be prosecuted, ... for any offense, not capital, except as provided in section 1046, unless the indictment is found , ... within three years next after such offense shall have been committed: Provided, however, that in offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States ... the period \n\n[271 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n of limitation shall be six years.'\n\n The amendatory act added the proviso. Section 1046, Revised Statutes ( Comp. St.  1710), declares that no person shall be prosecuted for any crime arising under the revenue laws unless the indictment is found within five years after the committing of such crime. Act July 5, 1884, c. 225, 23 Stat. 122, as amended by Revenue Act 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 315 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1711), fixes a three-year period of limitation for offenses arising under the internal revenue laws of the United States. Section 125 of the Criminal Code, under which the indictment was found, is not a part of and does not refer to the revenue laws. The limitations fixed in respect of offenses arising under those laws do not apply. See United States v. Hirsch, \n100 U.S. 33\n; United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78\n, 35 S. Ct. 682\n\n\n Plaintiff in error contends that, as the perjury in this case is charged to have been committed in the making of an income tax return, and is specially alleged to have been committed for the purpose of defrauding the United States, the offense is brought within the proviso to section 1044, and that the six-year period of limitation applies. But the alleged purpose to defraud the United States is not an element of the crime defined in section 125, on which the indictment is based. That allegation does not affect the charge; it need not be proved and may be rejected as mere surplusage. In re Lane, \n135 \nU.S. 443, 448\n, 10 S. Ct. 760. The construction of sections 125 and 1044 contended for by the government divides perjury into two classes. It makes one include offenses having the elements specified in section 125 and the other to include those containing the further element of purpose to defraud the United States. And that would apply similarly to every offense to which the three- year period fixed by section 1044 was applicable before the proviso was added. The effect is to create offenses separate and distinct from those defined by specific enactments. Obviously that was not intended. The Act of \n\n[271 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n November 17, 1921, merely added a proviso to a statute of limitations. Statutes will not be read to create crimes, or new degrees or classes of crime, unless the purpose so to do is plain. The language in question does not require the construction contended for. Indeed it is not all appropriate for the making of such classifications or the creation of offenses. Its purpose is to apply the six-year period to every case in which defrauding or an attempt to defraud the United States is an ingredient under the statute defining the offense. There are several such offenses. Section 37 (Comp. St.  10201) affords an illustration. But perjury as defined by section 125 does not contain any such element.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","206":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. P.

Monnig, both of Detroit, Mich., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[270 U.S. 512, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The P. Koenig Coal Company was indicted in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, under the Elkins Act (Comp. St. ss 8597-8599 ), for knowingly receiving as a shipper concessions from a carrier under the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St. s 8563 et seq.) in respect to transportation of property in interstate commerce obtained by deceitful representation made to the carriers on which the carriers innocently and in good faith relied. The District Court sustained a demurrer to the indictment, and the United States prosecutes a writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act (Judicial Code, s 238, par. 2, as re-enacted by the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 938, c. 229 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 1215)), which provides that a writ of error from the District Court may be taken directly to this Court from a judgment sustaining a demurrer to any indictment or any count thereof where such judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded. \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 515]\n\u00a0\n The District Court held that section 1 of the Elkins Act of February 19, 1903, c. 708, 32 Stat. 847 (re-enacted in section 2 of the Hepburn Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 587 (Comp. St. s 8597)), under which the indictment was found, applies only to a shipper who knowingly receives a concession from a carrier when such concession is knowingly granted by the carrier in equal guilt with the shipper. United States v. P. Koenig Coal Co., 1 F. (2d) 738.\n The Koenig Coal Company is a Michigan corporation doing business in Detroit. The defendant was indicted on 18 counts applying respectively to 18 carloads of coal. The shipments originated in West Virginia, and were moved to Detroit in August, 1922, over the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company as the initial carrier for each car.\n On July 25, 1922, the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under the Transportation Act of February 28, 1920 (chapter 91, tit. 4, s 402 (15 ), 41 Stat. 456, 476 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 8563)), issued its service order No. 23. Paragraph 15 gives the Commission, when shortage of equipment, congestion of traffic, or other emergency requires action in any section of the country, authority to suspend its rules as to car service, and to make such reasonable rules with regard to it as in the Commission's opinion will best promote the service in the interest of the public and the commerce of the people, and to give direction for performance or priority in transportation or movement of traffic. Service Order No. 23 declared that there was an emergency upon the railroad lines east of the Mississippi river, and directed that coal cars should be furnished to the mines according to a certain order of purposes, numbered in classes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and that no coal embraced in classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 should be subject to reconsignment, or diversion except for some purpose in the same or a superior class. The order required that the carriers should give preference and priority in the placement and assignment of cars for \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 516]\n\u00a0\n the loading of coal to those required for the current use of hospitals which were placed in class 2, in priority to cars for the loading of coal required for the manufacture of automobiles or automobile parts, which were placed in class 5 and later in class 3. The order remained in force from July 25 to September 20, 1922. The first count of the indictment charged that the defendant intending to obtain a preference and priority in transportation, which it was not then lawfully entitled to receive, and to procure the coal for the use of Dodge & Co., engaged in the manufacture of automobiles and parts thereof, sent a telegraphic order to the Monitor Coal & Coke Company, of Huntington, W. Va., asking the shipment of carloads of coal to the Koenig Coal Company at Detroit for the use of the Samaritan Hospital; that it thereby secured the furnishing by the C. & O. Company on August 5, 1922, at the request of the Monitor Company, of one car suitable for the loading and transportation of coal on its line in West Virginia, which was billed and consigned in accordance with the telegraphic order; that, when it reached Detroit, the defendant diverted the car to Dodge Bros., who used the coal, the Samaritan Hospital not needing or requiring the coal, and not having authorized or requested the defendant to send the order; that the concession and discrimination was thus obtained by a deceitful device of which the carriers had no knowledge. The other 17 counts are similar and refer to different cars of coal, some of them to different mines and consignors, and some to different beneficiaries of the trick as actual consumers of the coal.\n The demurrer challenged the indictment on various grounds: First, that the facts charged did not constitute a concession given or a discrimination practiced as defined by the Elkins Act; second, that the restrictions imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission's Service Order No. 23 were beyond the power of the Interstate Commerce \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 517]\n\u00a0\n Commission, in that they were an exercise of purely legislative power which could not be delegated; third, that the service order exceeded the authority conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission; fourth, in that it was beyond the power of the federal government thus to affect the use, consumption, price, and disposition of coal in what was the exercise of a local police power reserved to the states; fifth, that the order is so arbitrary and unreasonable as not to be within the power of the national government and to be an encroachment on the powers of the several states; sixth, that the service order violated the Fifth Amendment in depriving defendant of liberty and property without due process of law; and, seventh, that it was invalid because it gave preference to the Lake Erie ports of Ohio and Pennsylvania over the ports of other states in respect to the transportation and shipment of coal.\n All of these objections, except the first and third, are covered by the decision of this court in Avent v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 34, \n266 U.S. 127\n, where we held that Congress might consistently with the Fifth Amendment require a preference in the order of purposes for which coal might be carried in interstate commerce, that it did not trench upon the power reserved to the states, that the power might be delegated to the Interstate Commerce Commission for exercise under rules that were reasonable and in the interests of the public and of commerce, that the violation of such rules might be made a crime, and that the objection that the order unconstitutionally preferred the ports of one state over those of another could not avail a party whom the alleged preference did not concern.\n Counsel for the defendant in his brief and argument supports the demurrer solely upon the same ground upon which the District Court sustained it, namely, that the offense under which the indictment is drawn cannot be \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 518]\n\u00a0\n committed without the guilty knowledge and collusion of both the shipper and the carrier. The relevant part of section 1 of the Elkins Act (Comp. St. s 8597) reads as follows:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, or corporation to offer, grant, or give, or to solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce by any common carrier subject to said Act to Regulate Commerce and the acts amendatory thereof whereby any such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier, as is required by said Act to Regulate Commerce and the acts amendatory thereof, or whereby any other advantage is given or discrimination is practiced. Every person or corporation, whether carrier or shipper, who shall, knowingly, offer, grant, or give, or solicit, accept, or receive any such rebates, concession, or discrimination shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000, nor more than $20,000.'\n\n This makes it unlawful for any one to receive any concession in respect of transportation of any property in interstate commerce by a common carrier whereby any advantage is given or any discrimination is practiced. The facts charged bring what was done exactly within this description. It was a priority or preference in securing the transportation of coal in an emergent congestion of the traffic. It was certainly a concession and one of value to one who under the law or the regulations having the force of law could not secure that priority. The words 'advantage,' 'concession,' and 'discrimination' in the statute must be construed to mean unlawful concession, unlawful advantage, unlawful discrimination. It certainly was not the intention of Congress to punish the granting or receiving of a lawful concession, a lawful ad- \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 519]\n\u00a0\n vantage or a lawful discrimination. It is asked, if this was a concession, by whom was it conceded? The answer is by the carrier. He granted the priority and therefore he made the concession and gave the advantage and practiced the discrimination. But it was unlawful, and he did not know the facts which made it so. The shipper knew them because he had secured it by his deceit and received it. What is there in the statute that releases him from guilt, because the carrier who yielded to him the concession, and gave him the advantage and made the discrimination, thought it was lawful?\n Reference is made to the debates in Congress and to decisions of this court to show that in the minds of the legislators in enacting the Elkins Act, the discrimination and inequality they sought to prevent had in the past arisen chiefly from collusion between the carrier and the shipper. As practical men of course they knew that this was the way in which violations of the law were most likely to occur. But this does not at all justify the conclusion that Congress in enacting the Elkins Law intended to limit the offenses described in it to cases of collusion, if otherwise the acts charged came within the words of the statute.\n We have often declared that the purpose of Congress in the Elkins Law was to cut up by the roots every form of discrimination, favoritism and inequality. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 31 S. Ct. 265, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 478\n, 34 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 671; New York, New Haven R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 26 S. Ct. 272, \n200 U.S. 361\n, 391; Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 28 S. Ct. 428, \n209 U.S. 56\n, 72; United States v. Union Stockyards, 33 S. Ct. 83, \n226 U.S. 286\n, 309. It would be contrary, therefore, to the general intent of the law to restrain the effect of the language used so as not to include acts exactly described when they clearly effect discrimination and inequality. Certainly no one would say that a shipper might not be convicted under the act of soliciting an un- \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 520]\n\u00a0\n lawful concession or advantage or discrimination even though the carrier refused to extend it to him. So, too, if a carrier offers an unlawful advantage to a shipper who declines it, clearly the carrier may be indicted and punished. Collusion is not necessary in such a case. Why in this? The act is plainly not confined to joint crimes. The general rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed has no application when the general purpose of the Legislature is manifest and is subserved by giving the words used in the statute their ordinary meaning and thus covering the acts charged.\n In Dye v. United States (C. C. A.) 262 F. 6, a defendant in an indictment under the Elkins Act was the agent of a carrier and was in charge of the distribution of cars between coal mines during an emergency and car shortage. By a device, he violated the rule of distribution established by the Commission and secured an excessive number of cars for a particular mine, the operators of which were innocent of the inequality. He did this for his personal profit by sale of the excess. His conviction was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n In Missouri, Kansas & Texas Pacific Ry. Co. v. Harriman, 33 S. Ct. 397, \n227 U.S. 657\n, the court had to deal with the question whether a shipper who valued his goods for the purpose of obtaining the lower of two published rates based on valuation was in an action for their loss estopped from recovering a greater amount than his own valuation, the carrier having no knowledge of the value of the shipment. It was held that he was estopped. In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Justice Lurton, speaking for the court, at page 671 (33 S. Ct. 400), said:\n'If he knowingly declares an undervaluation for the purpose of obtaining the lower of two published rates, he thereby obtains an advantage and causes a discrimination forbidden and made unlawful by the first section of the Elkins Act of February 19, 1903 (32 Stat. 847, c. 708).' \n\n[270 U.S. 512, 521]\n\u00a0\n It is true that this was said arguendo, but it has persuasive weight and now that the point is before us for judgment we reaffirm it.

Co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $ 21,295.62, being 2 per cent. tax on their consolidated income for 1921. Plaintiffs have taken a cross-appeal, and insist that the court erred in failing to add their expenses and attorney's fees.\n The Pittsburgh Company owned all the capital stock of the West Side Company. Their railroads were taken over by the President and were operated under federal control from January 1, 1918, to March 1, 1920. They failed to make any agreement with the Railroad Administration as to just compensation to be paid them for the use of their properties until final settlement was made July 1, 1921. At that time there was paid to plaintiffs $1,570,000 in addition to $250,000 which had been paid on account in January, 1920. And the Director General assumed, in respect of the payment of taxes, the obligations which are specified in section 6 of the standard form contract authorized by the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918,  1, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919 ,  3115 3\/4 a). \n\n[271 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiffs made returns and paid the full amount of federal taxes for 1918 and 1919, respectively. These included nothing received as compensation for the use of their properties. The Director General reimbursed them to the extent of the normal taxes. Plaintiffs made their return and paid their taxes for 1920. Their income in that year in cluded the $250,000 paid on account. As federal control ended March 1, the Director General declined to allow more than one-sixth of the tax. The plaintiffs' taxable net income for 1921 was $1,064,781.39. This, because of deductions allowed, was less than the payment at final settlement. In 1923, upon plaintiffs' insistence, the Bureau of Internal Revenue held that the compensation received in 1921 for the use of their properties during federal control was income for that year, and that none of it was attributable to the period of federal control. Subsequently plaintiffs called on the Railroad Administration for payment of $21,295.62, 2 per cent. of their income.\n The question for decision is whether plaintiffs' income tax for 1921 was 'assessed for the period of federal control,' within the meaning of the Federal Control Act and the authorized standard contract.\n Section 1 of the Federal Control Act required that every such agreement should provide that federal taxes under the Revenue Act of 1917 ( 40 Stat. 300), or acts in addition thereto or in amendment thereof, commonly called was taxes, 'assessed for the period of federal control beginning January first, nineteen hundred and eighteen, or any part of such period' should be paid by the carrier out of its own funds or should be charged against or deducted from the just compensation; that other taxes assessed 'for the period of federal control or any part thereof,' should be paid out of revenues derived from operations while under federal control.\n The authorized standard form of contract, section 6(a), provided that all war taxes assessed against the company \n\n[271 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n under the Revenue Act of 1917 or any act in addition thereto or in amendment thereof should be paid by the company. And paragraph (c) provided that the Director General should either pay out of revenues derived from railway operations 'during the period of federal control,' or save the company harmless from all taxes lawfully assessed under federal or other governmental authority 'for any part of said period,' except the taxes and assessments for which provision was made in paragraph (a).\n The tax of 2 per cent. imposed by section 10 of the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 765) was known as the normal tax. The additional tax of 4 per cent. imposed by section 4 of the Revenue Act of 1917 (Comp. St. 1918 ,  6336jj) was a war tax. Section 230(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 nn) provided that, in lieu of the 2 per cent. normal tax and the 4 per cent. war tax, there should be paid for the calendar year 1918 a tax of 12 per cent. of net incomes and for each year thereafter 10 per cent. Section 230(b) provided that, for the purpose of the Federal Control Act, five sixths of the 12 per cent. tax and four- fifths of the 10 per cent. tax should be 'treated as levied by an act in amendment of title I of the Revenue Act of 1917.' Thus, it was plainly indicated that the tax to be borne by the Director General was the 2 per cent. The amount in controversy is 2 per cent. of the income tax for 1921. It was assessed under the Revenue Act of that year (42 Stat. 227), which provided that, in lieu of taxes imposed by the act of 1918, there should be paid 10 per cent. of net incomes for 1921 and 12 1\/2 per cent. for each year thereafter. The divisions between the Director General and the corporation, prescribed by subdivision (b) of section 230 of the act of 1918 applied only to taxes imposed by subdivision (a) of that section. No divisions were prescribed by the act of 1921. Those made by the earlier act were not intended to apply to taxes imposed by the act of 1921, and neither of them would produce the two per cent. normal tax if applied to 12 1\/2 per cent., the rate for each year after 1921\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n The provisions of section 6 of the standard form of contract, the Federal Control Act and Revenue Acts are to be read together. When this is done, it is clear that the obligation of the Director General to bear the normal income taxes of the corporations did not go beyond those assessed for the period of federal control. That obligation was not held down to the normal tax on amounts received as compensation for the use of their properties, but extended to the normal tax assessed for that period on all incomes taxed without regard to source. But it cannot be held to extend to taxes on incomes for 1921 without excluding from consideration the provisions of the Federal Control Act and standard agreement clearly limiting the obligation to taxes assessed for the period of federal control. The meaning of these provisions is plain. There is no room for construction. The period in which the assessments were made governed. The sources of taxable incomes were not regarded. It would be contrary to the plain language of the statute and contract to hold the United States liable for any part of the taxes for 1921. Plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.\n Their cross-appeal depends upon a provision contained in section 6 of the standard contract binding the Director General to pay or save the company harmless from expense of suits respecting the classes of taxes payable by the Director General under the agreement. As the tax was not so payable, plaintiffs take nothing by their cross-appeal.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","208":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

December 3, 1920, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, to which plaintiff, the Reading Company, is successor, brought this action to recover its charges for transportation of troops and military impedimenta by that company and connecting carriers prior to federal control of railroads. When the railroads were taken over, the United States owed the company $24,900.01 for that transportation.\n Federal control of railroads commenced December 28, 1917, and ended March 1, 1920. Pursuant to the Federal Control Act, approved March 21, 1918 (chapter 25, 40 Stat. 451 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, ss 3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p)), the Director General, February 18, 1920, entered into the standard form contract with the Philadelphia & Reading and its affiliated companies. It was agreed that the President took the company's accounts receivable as of midnight, December 31, 1917; that all amounts collected by the Director General on account of receivables should be credited by him to the company; that he was authorized, to the extent of cash realized upon the company's assets then on hand, to pay and charge to the company expenses arising out of operation prior to federal control, including reparation claims; that, unless objected to by the company, he might pay and charge to the company expenses and claims in excess of the cash so realized; and that at the end of federal control, the Director General should return to the company all uncollected accounts. \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 323]\n\u00a0\n Prior to June 14, 1918, there was paid by the disbursing officer of the army to the Director General $26,157.20 on account of the bills for transportation before federal control. February 18, 1920, the Auditor of the War Department deducted $1,257.19-as to which there is no controversy- from the Director General's bills for transportation during federal control, and the latter reimbursed himself by deducting that amount from the $26,157.20 paid him by the disbursing officer, leaving in his hands a balance of $24,900.01.\n June 18, 1918, the Comptroller ruled (24 Comp. Dec. 774) that, for each 25 officers and enlisted men traveling the United States was entitled to a free car for the transportation of camp equipment and property. But that decision was erroneous, and it was so held June 13, 1921. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, 56 Ct. Cl. 341, 348.\n At different times in 1920, prior to July 16, the Auditor of the War Department, in order to adjust payments to the basis of the Comptroller's ruling, disallowed as overpayments items aggregating $14,236.04 of the amount paid by the disbursing officer to the Director General, and took that amount from pending Railroad Administration bills for transportation during federal control. The Director General deducted the same amount from the $24,900.01 remaining in his hands, leaving a balance of only $10,663. 97 which was credited to the company in the account 'Assets, December 31, 1917, Collected.' February 24, 1920, the Director General promulgated General Order No. 66 providing for account incident to the termination of federal control. This order (section 5a) directed that, where there were paid out of federal funds overcharge freight claims in respect of traffic, the revenues from which were included in corporate revenue, the amounts should be charged on the federal books to the corporation in the account 'Corporate Transactions,' and \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 324]\n\u00a0\n on the corporate books such amounts should be charged to an appropriate suspense account and credited to the United States in a corresponding account. This required the amount of the deduction, $14,236.04, so to be charged and credited.\n Argust 25, 1920, the War Department paid the Railroad Administration a large sum in full settlement for all transportation during federal control. Thereupon the Director General issued Accounting Circular 152, which announced the settlement, and stated, 'Special attention is directed to the fact that the settlement above referred to involves the War Department only, ... and does not include bills rendered in the federal accounts for transportation service performed prior to federal control,' and directed that unpaid bills for such transportation 'shall not be closed into the account 'War Department Transportation Charges,' but instead shall be charged to the corporation through the account '(Name of Corporation)-Corporate Transactions.\"\n The Court of Claims found that 'the final account of the final settlement between the Director General of Railroads and the plaintiff reads as follows: 'United States Railroad Administration, Director General of Railroads.-Comparison of claim submitted by the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Co. ... with books of the central administration adjusted to March 31, 1922.\" The statement is printed in the margin.* \n The two accounts in-\n []\n Due to Corporation.

The United States relies on the phrase 'growing out of federal control' to show that plaintiff's claim was an obligation or demand included in the settlement. The phrase is general, and, if considered independently of context and the transactions which led up to the agreement, its meaning would be too indefinite and vague to have any significance. The surrounding circumstances must be considered. Reed v. Insurance Company, \n95 U.S. 23\n, 30. The President as a war measure took possession and the use of the transportation systems of the country. The taking was temporary. The Federal Control Act authorized agreements in respect of compensation for the use of the property. The Transportation Act of 1920, s 202, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 459 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 10071 1\/4 b), directed that, as soon as practicable after the termination of federal control, the President should settle and wind up all matters 'arising out of or incident to federal control.' A Director General was appointed and a Railroad Administration was created to unify control of all the properties for the more efficient transportation of troops and war materials. All control was taken out of the hands of the companies; but the Director General made use of their former organizations, officials, and employees. When the transfer of control was made, it was convenient for all concerned-if not, indeed, necessary-that freight bills then remaining unpaid should be handled by the persons in charge of the operating properties. There was no expropriation of the companies' accounts receivable for transportation before federal control. They did not become the property of the United States. Amounts collected or paid out by the Director General on account of assets or liabilities of the companies existing or arising before federal control were dealt with separately, and respectively credited and charged to the companies. In making such collections \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 329]\n\u00a0\n and disbursements, the Director General acted in respect of the affairs of the company which were wholly distinct from transactions arising from operation during federal control.\n The War Department made use of Railroad Administration bills to retake the supposed overcharges. The effect was the same as if $14,236.04 had been deducted before payment directly from the company's bills. Assuming that he had the power, the Director General did not undertake to settle questions between the War Department and the company in respect of freight bills for transportation before federal control. Accounting Circular 152 shows that the Railroad Administration did not attempt to secure the release of the War Department from liability for the unpaid balance owing on company bills. The Director General's charge of $14,236. 04 against the company in the corporate transactions account was the same as if the company had paid the amount in cash to the Railroad Administration, to make it whole in respect of its efforts to collect the company's bills. So far as the book entries are concerned, the company retained its claim for transportation against the United States; and plaintiff is entitled to recover, unless the Philadelphia & Reading gave up its claim by the final settlement agreement.\n But the government contends that 'the final account of the final settlement' cannot be considered, and argues that it purports only to adjust claims to March 31, 1922, while the 'final settlement' agreement was made June 30, 1922; that these documents have no relation to each other; and that the account deals only with details, whereas the contract of settlement embraces all demands, whether included in the account or not. These contentions are not sustained. The findings of fact must be accepted. The court found that 'that final account of the final settlement ... reads as follows.' This is \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 330]\n\u00a0\n unequivocal; the meaning is plain, and there is no room for exposition. The only sum included for the company's transportation before federal control is $10,663.97. The amount retaken, $14,236.04, was charged to the company. In final settlement, the company paid $8,000,000, the exact sum stated in the final account.\n Obviously, the transportation for which claim is made, and the Auditor's ruling that the disbursing officer made overpayment, did not grow out of federal control. And, if collection of company bills by the Director General otherwise might be deemed to have been incident to federal control, the book entries and the final account show that the balance owing for the transportation in question belonged to the company. By the standard from of contract, the Director General was bound, at the termination of federal control, to return to the company all uncollected accounts. This action was pending more than a year and a half when the settlement was made. If the parties intended to settle the claim sued on, a dismissal of the action by consent should have followed. The transactions but of which the Auditor's erroneous deductions grew did not concern the Railroad Administration, and in respect of them there never was any question between it and the company. Plaintiff's claim was in no sense an obligation or demand against the Railroad Administration or the United States in respect of the federal control of railroads. The facts make it clear that the final agreement did not release the United States from liability for the freight charges in question.\n No. 402.\n This is the Reading Company's cross-appeal. On the findings, it claims judgment for $6,990.92 additional. Certain bills prepared by the company were based on class A rates on military impedimenta. these bills were restated by the company without protest on the basis of \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 331]\n\u00a0\n class D rates with landgrant deductions. The restated bills were paid. Certain other bills for like transportation were originally stated on the basis of class D rates with land grant deductions and were paid, and other bills for similar service were withdrawn and restated for lesser sums; the amounts so claimed were paid. The facts found by the Court of Claims are not sufficient to justify any recovery, and bring the case presented on cross-appeal within the ruling in Oregon-Washington R. Co. v. United States, 41 S. Ct. 329, \n255 U.S. 339\n, 345; Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 233, \n267 U.S. 395\n, 401; C., M. & St. P. Ry. v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 237, \n267 U.S. 403\n. The cross-appeal is without merit.\n No. 403.\n The United States appeals from a judgment against it for $48,439.68. This case is similar to No. 401. In 1916 and 1917, plaintiff, Southern Railway Company, transported military impedimenta for the United States, and presented its bills therefor. The disbursing officer of the army paid some of them to plaintiff in 1917, and, after the plaintiff's railroad was taken over, paid others to the Director General. These amounts were credited on federal books to plaintiff as 'revenue prior to January 1, 1918.' The Auditor of the War Department, following a ruling made by the Comptroller, June 18, 1918, held that the disbursing officer had made overpayments on account of these bills amounting to $48,439.68, and, to recover the supposed overpayments, deductions were made at different times from the bills of the Railroad Administration for transportation during federal control. Then the Director General charged the amount of these deductions to plaintiff in an account designated 'Corporate Transactions,' and they were credited to the Railroad Administration on the books of plaintiff in a corresponding account. \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 332]\n\u00a0\n The Auditor's finding that overpayments were made was erroneous. Plaintiff was entitled to the amounts paid by the disbursing officer. The government's sole contention is that the final settlement in respect of matters growing out of federal control operated to discharge the claim sued on. The Court of Claims incorporated in its findings the final account of the final settlement between the Director General and the plaintiff. Its form is substantially the same as that set out in the margin in No. 401. At the top of the statement, there is this notation: '( Final settlement contract, June 22, 1921.)' The amount admitted by the plaintiff to be due the Railroad Administration on the account 'Corporate Transactions' was less than the amount claimed by the Railroad Administration. But the Court of Claims expressly found that prior to the settlement the parties agreed upon the smaller amount, and that there was no compromise of the amount charged against the plaintiff in 'Corporate Transactions'; that the full amount charged by the Railroad Administration was paid by the plaintiff, and included therein was the sum of $48,439.68, deducted from Railroad Administration bills on account of supposed overpayments of plaintiff's bills. The final settlement agreement was made June 22, 1921. It is in the same form, and, so far as concerns the matters here in controversy, has the same force and effect, as that quoted in No. 401. That decision controls this case.\n No. 404.\n The United States appeals from a judgment for $15,143.91. This case is similar to Nos. 401 and 403. In 1916 and 1917 plaintiff, the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway Company, and connecting carriers, transported military impedimenta for the United States, and plaintiff presented bills therefor, The disbursing officer of the army paid some of them to plaintiff in 1917. When auditing the disbursing officer's account, the \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 333]\n\u00a0\n Auditor of the War Department erroneously disallowed payments made by him, and, pending settlement of the account, the company's railroad was taken over by the President. In order to recover the supposed overpayments, the Auditor deducted $15,143.91 from bills of the Railroad Administration for transportation during federal control, $13,035.97 during federal control, and the balance later. The Railroad Administration charged the amount deducted against plaintiff in the account 'Corporate Transactions' in accordance with General Order No. 66, and that amount was credited to the Railroad Administration and charged against the War Department on the plaintiff's books. There was a final settlement agreement between the Director General and the plaintiff dated July 29, 1921. The final account of settlement was made as of May 31, 1921. It consisted of a comparison of claims submitted by the plaintiff with the books of the central administration adjusted to that date. The court expressly found that there was no dispute as to the amount due from plaintiff to the Railroad Administration on the account 'Corporate Transactions,' and that the same was paid in full in the final settlement. Included in the amount was the sum of $15,143.91 deducted from Railroad Administration bills on account of supposed overpayments. The final account relates to the settlement agreement. The agreement shows that the Director General paid the company the exact amount shown by the final account to be due the corporation according to the administration books. The agreement is in the same form, and, so far as concerns the matters here in controversy, has the same force and effect as that quoted in No. 401. That decision controls in this case.\n No. 398-No. 399-No. 400.\n In No. 398, the United States appeals from a judgment against it for $ 12,176. The amount here in contro- \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 334]\n\u00a0\n versy is $9,160.89. In 1916 and 1917 plaintiff, the New Haven, and connecting carriers, transported certain military impedimenta on government bills of lading, and plaintiff, as last carrier, presented its bills therefor. Plaintiff's transportation system was taken over by the President December 28, 1917. The disbursing officer of the army paid some of these bills to plaintiff before, and some to the Railroad Administration after, the railroads were taken over. In auditing the accounts of the disbursing officer, the Auditor of the War Department, following the erroneous ruling of the Comptroller (24 Comp. Dec. 774), disallowed as overpayments $9,160.89 of the amount paid on these bills. The plaintiff refused to refund. Then, in order to recover the supposed overpayments, the Auditor deducted from the bills of the Railroad Administration presented to the disbursing officer, $7,295.54 during, and $ 1,865.35 after, federal control. The total was charged on the books of the Railroad Administration to the plaintiff. General Order No. 68 created a trustee account to take effect at the termination of federal control, midnight February 29, 1920. By this order, railroads that had been under federal control were made trustees of the Railroad Administration to collect its unpaid bills, to pay its liabilities, and generally to wind up its unfinished business. The cash pertaining to the transportation business was turned over to the railroads to be carried to that account, and money erroneously paid into the trustee account by deposit could be withdrawn by the consent of the Director General. In January, 1921, plaintiff paid into the trustee account $9,160.89 to make good to the Railroad Administration the deductions erroneously made by the Auditor of the War Department, and on its own books plaintiff charged that amount to the War Department. March 21, 1922, this action was commenced.\n October 26, 1923, there was a final settlement between the plaintiff and the Director General, consisting of a final \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 335]\n\u00a0\n account and agreement. The form of the account is similar to that printed in the margin in No. 401. And that agreement, so far as concerns the government's insistence that plaintiff released the claim in suit, contains the same language as that quoted and discussed in No. 401; and in this case the agreement contains an exception:\n'This settlement does not include or affect any moneys or assets of the Director General turned over to the company pursuant to General Order No. 68, the account created by this order to be adjusted as though this agreement had not been made.'\n\n There was no overpayment on account of plaintiff's bills. Plaintiff was entitled to the amount paid by the disbursing officer, and rightly refused to refund. The effect of the auditor's deductions was to compel the Railroad Administration to refund for account of plaintiff the amount of the supposed overpayments. The amount so refunded was rightly charged to plaintiff, and was repaid by deposit in the trustee account. The agreement expressly excluded that account and left it to be adjusted as if no settlement had been made. The transaction out of which the Auditor's deductions arose did not concern the Railroad Administration, and in respect of that matter there never was any question or dispute between it and plaintiff. The matter in controversy was wholly between the War Department and plaintiff. The effect of the exception quoted was to exclude plaintiff's claim from the settlement, and to leave the plaintiff free to continue to prosecute this action to recover the amount erroneously deducted as overpayments on plaintiff's bills; and plaintiff's claim was in no sense an obligation or a demand against the United States in respect of the federal control of railroads.\n No. 399 and No. 400 are controlled by our decision in this case. \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 336]\n\u00a0\n No. 499 and No. 500.\n No. 499 is an appeal by the United States from a judgment against it for $18,796.68. The amount here involved is $16,588.13. The transportation system of plaintiff, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, was taken over by the President December 28, 1917, and federal control continued until March 1, 1920. In 1916 and 1917, plaintiff and connecting carriers transported troops upon government transportation requests. Plaintiff, as initial carrier, presented bills therefor based on net per capita fares obtained by combinations only on the western gateways specified in the interterritorial military arrangements of 1916 and 1917. Payments amounting to $289,774.89 were made by the proper disbursing officer. Some of these payments, $172,210.31, were made to plaintiff before federal control. The balance were made during federal control to the Director General, and were credited to plaintiff. The Auditor of the War Department, in auditing the accounts of the disbursing officer, disallowed as overpayments on account of these bills, $20,978.45, and at different times from March 12 to September 17, 1920, deducted from bills of the Railroad Administration the amount of the supposed overpayments. These deductions, to the amount of $16,588.13, were obtained by routing not authorized by the interterritorial military arrangements. The disallowances were held erroneous on the authority of Atchison, etc., Ry v. United States, 41 S. Ct. 456, \n256 U.S. 205\n. The government does not support them. The Court of Claims held that deductions made by the auditor amounting to $4,390.32 were proper, and, as no cross-appeal was taken, they are not here involved.\n Of the total amount deducted, plaintiff refunded $13.58 to the War Department, and the Railroad Administration charged back to plaintiff $20, 939.52 through the account 'Federal Assets Collected,' and $25.35 through the account 'Corporate Transactions.' \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 337]\n\u00a0\n In December, 1921, the plaintiff paid into the trustee account, created in accordance with General Order No. 68 to the credit of the Administration, $20,939.52, and charged that amount against the War Department.\n July 27, 1922, there was a final settlement between the Director General and the plaintiff. That agreement, so far as concerns the government's insistence that plaintiff released the claim in suit, contains the same language as that quoted in No. 401. The agreement also contains an exception in the same language, and having the same force and effect, as that quoted in No. 398. Our decisions in those cases are controlling here.\n No. 500 is also controlled by them.\n No. 36.\n This is an appeal by the plaintiff, the Pere Marquette, from a judgment that it is not entitled to recover. In 1917, plaintiff transported military impedimenta on government bills of lading, and presented its bill, based on lawfully published tariffs less land-grant deductions, amounting to $3,828.08. The disbursing officer paid that amount to plaintiff. Subsequently the Auditor of the War Department, following a decision of the Comptroller, erroneously disallowed the full amount The plaintiff's railroad was then under federal control, and the Auditor deducted an equal amount from sums due the Railroad Administration for transportation in October and November, 1918. The government does not support the Auditor's disallowance of plaintiff's claim or the deduction of an equivalent amount from the Railroad Administration.\n July, 1920, in an adjustment of accounts between plaintiff and the Railroad Administration, the amount in question was credited by plaintiff to the Railroad Administration, and it remains outstanding on plaintiff's books as an unpaid balance on its bill, paid, but afterwards disallowed, by the Auditor. November 12, 1921, a final settlement \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 338]\n\u00a0\n was made between the plaintiff and the Railroad Administration. The contract contains the same general language in respect of the purpose of the instrument as that considered in our decision in No. 401.\n This action was commenced September 2, 1921, and on December 10, 1923, the Court of Claims gave judgment, citing Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States, and Philadelphia & Reading R. R. v. United States, decided in that court November 5, 1923. But in the Louisville & Nashville Case the judgment was vacated, and, on rehearing, a judgment was entered in favor of the company, April 26, 1925. After the appeal in the case at bar, new trials were granted by the Court of Claims in other similar cases, which had been decided for the United States, and January 5, 1925, judgment was entered for plaintiff in each. Appeals were taken by the United States; motions to advance were granted. This case and the others decided with it were argued and submitted at the same time.\n The government contends that there is no finding that plaintiff repaid the Railroad Administration the amount erroneously deducted by the Auditor, that the book entries are not sufficient evidence of repayment, and that it was the intention of the settlement agreement to include this claim as one growing out of federal control. But the finding is that plaintiff gave appropriate credit to the Railroad Administration, and that plaintiff's books show its bill has not been paid. General Order No. 66, General Order No. 68, and Accounting Circular 152 were promulgated by the Railroad Administration for general application. It is to be presumed that the rules there laid down were followed, that the amount in question was charged back to plaintiff on the federal books, and that settlement was made on that basis. Moreover, if it had been the intention of the settlement agreement to include this claim as one growing out of federal control, a consent \n\n[270 U.S. 320, 339]\n\u00a0\n dismissal of this action, then pending, should have followed. Our decision in No. 401 controls this case.\n Judgments in Nos. 401, 402, 403, 404, 398, 399, 400, 499, and 500 affirmed.\n Judgment in No. 36 reversed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES took no part in the consideration of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Administration Corporation books as claim as of of March Difference.

Long, all of Detroit, Mich., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pursuant to an appropriation for the improvement of the Rouge River, Michigan, made in the Rivers and Har- \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n bors Act of August 8, 1917,1 the United States filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan five petitions for the condemnation of numerous parcels of riparian land needed for such improvement, and, also, of a gas main passing underneath the river. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitions were consolidated, and a jury trial had resulting in seventy-three awards of compensation to the property owners. Judgments were entered confirming all these awards. Writs of error were sued out by the United States to review the judgments as to fifteen of the awards to riparian land owners and the award to the owner of the gas main. These were heard by the Circuit Court of Appeals as one case, and all the judgments were affirmed except that awarding compensation to the owner of the gas main, as to which a new trial was granted. 285 F. 111. This writ of error is brought to review the judgments as to the awards thus affirmed, involving fifteen parcels of land.\n\n 1. \nWe are of opinion that, although a new trial was granted as to the award to the owner of the gas main, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the awards to the riparian land owners, has such finality and completeness that it may be reviewed under this writ of error. The controversy as to the gas main is entirely distinct \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n from those as to the riparian lands; and its result can have no bearing whatever upon the awards to the land owners. While the general rule requires that a judgment of a federal court shall be final and complete before it may be reviewed on a writ of error or appeal, it is well settled that an adjudication final in its nature as to a matter distinct from the general subject of the litigation and affecting only the parties to the particular controversy, may be reviewed without awaiting the determination of the general litigation. Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 699\n, 4 S. Ct. 638; Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 371\n, 40 S. Ct. 347; Arnold v. Guimarin, \n263 \nU.S. 427, 434\n, 44 S. Ct. 144. And so, conversely, an adjudication final in its nature as to the general subject of the litigation may be reviewed without awaiting the determination of a separate matter affecting only the parties to such particular controversy.\n\n 2. \nThe principal matter here involved relates to the benefits to the land owners which were to be considered in reduction of their compensation and damages. The Rivers and Harbors Act of July 18, 1918,3 contains a provision-whose validity is not questioned-that in all condemnation proceedings by the United States to acquire lands for the public use in connection with any improvement of rivers, where a part only of any parcel of land is taken, the jury 'shall take into consideration by way of reducing the amount of compensation or damages any special and direct benefits to the remainder arising from the improvement.' In each of the sixteen instances here involved the United States condemned only a portion of the parcel of land belonging to the riparian owner. It insists that there was error in the instructions to the jury in reference to the extent and measure of the benefits to the remainder.\n The Rouge River, which empties into the Detroit River, had long been used for purposes of navigation, and various \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n industrial plants were located along its banks. Although it had been somewhat improved by the United States prior to 1917, the channel was narrow, winding, comparatively shallow, and incapable of accommodating large freighters. Under the terms of the Act of 1917 the new improvement was to be made in accordance with a plan recommended by the engineers of the War Department. \n4\n This contemplated straightening the channel of the river and widening and deepening it for about four miles above its mouth, so that it would accommodate the largest type of freighters on the Great Lakes and become, as was said, 'practically a long slip serving for numerous docks and industries.' The bottom width of the new channel was to be 200 feet, the banks sloping to a top width of 290 feet between the harbor lines. After its completion riparian owners desiring to construct docks were to be 'required to locate the dock line or retaining wall' upon the harbor line, and excavate the bank 'in front of the retaining wall or dock front' to the depty necessary to permit vessels to lie alongside.\n The portions of the lands which were condemned were those lying within the limits of the widened channel or harbor lines. The United States contended that the remaining portions of these parcels would receive special and direct benefits from the improvement by reason of fronting on the widened river and having direct access thereto for the building of docks and other purposes of navigation for which they had not been previously available.\n We are of opinion that an increase in the value of the remaining portion of any parcel of land caused by its frontage on the widened river, carrying a right of immediate access to and use of the improved stream, would constitute a special and direct benefit within the meaning of the statute, as distinguished from a benefit common to \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n all the lands in the vicinity, although the remaining portions of other riparian parcels would be similarly benefited. This is in accordance with the rule recognized by this court and established by the weight of authority in the state courts in reference to special benefits to lands abutting upon a new or widened street. Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 575\n, 17 S. Ct. 966; Allen v. Charlestown, 109 Mass. 243, 246; Hilbourne v. Suffolk County, 120 Mass. 393, 394, 21 Am. Rep. 522; Cross v. Plymouth, 125 Mass. 557, 558; Abbott v. Cottage City, 143 Mass. 521, 526, 10 N. E. 325, 58 Am. Rep. 143; Lewis v. Seattle, 5 Wash. 741, 758, 32 P. 794; Lowe v. Omaha, 33 Neb. 587, 593, 50 N. W. 760; St. Louis Railway v. Fowler, 142 Mo. 670, 683, 44 S. W. 771; 2 Lewis' Eminent Domain (3d Ed.)  702, p. 1216. And see Roberts v. Commissioners, 21 Kan. 247, 252; Trosper v. Commissioners, 27 Kan. 391, 393. In Allen v. Charlestown, supra, 246, the rule is thus stated:\n'The benefit is not less direct and special to the land of the petitioner, because other estates upon the same street are benefited in a similar manner. The kind of benefit, which is not allowed to be estimated for the purpose of such deduction, is that which comes from sharing in the common advantage and convenience of increased public facilities, and the general advance in value of real estate in the vicinity by reason thereof. ... The advantages of more convenient access to the particular lot of land in question, and of having a front upon a more desirable avenue, are direct benefits to that lot, giving it increased value in itself. It may be the same, in greater or less degree, with each and every lot of land upon the same street. But such advantages are direct and special to each lot. They are in no proper sense common because there are several estates, or many even, that are similarly benefited.'\n\n But while the trial judge recognized the right of the United States to the deduction of such special benefits, if any, it insists that in charging the jury in reference to them he erroneously minimized their nature and extent. \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 417]\n\u00a0\n In this portion of the charge the court stated, inter alia, that the Government had 'the absolute power of control' over navigable streams, and the right to deprive any riparian owner of all access to the navigable portion of the stream and order the removal of any docks or other structures placed in the stream; that the deepening and widening of the channel would not confer on any riparian owner any property right to use the river for loading or unloading of vessels, this being 'subject to the absolute power of control by the Government'; that the jury could not make any deduction of benefits on the theory that the improvement would increase any property right in connection with the access to or use of the river or bring the owner any new or different property right of access and use of purposes of navigation; that no benefit could be deducted unless the remainder of the land was rendered suitable for new or greater uses in navigation because of its new location 'and because of a greater opportunity directly and specially to enjoy such use of the improved river as the Government may permit such owner to have;' and that the jury should keep 'always in mind the uncertainty of securing from the Government the privilege to enjoy these advantages, and the limited character of whatever advantages may be so secured.'\n The United States not only excepted to these portions of the charge, but also requested that the jury be instructed, as bearing upon the existence and amount of the special benefits, that a riparian owner bordering on the new stream would have in respect thereto the usual rights of navigation pertinent to riparian property, that is, the right of access to the navigable part of the river in front of his property and the right to make a landing, dock or pier upon his harbor line, subject only to such general rules and regulations as the Government, in its power over navigation, might properly impose for the protection of the public right of navigation; that this \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 418]\n\u00a0\n power of the Government 'over navigation for the protection of public rights can not be arbitrarily and capriciously exercised so as to destroy these riparian rights, but must be exercised with reasonable relations to the requirements of navigation'; and that, by the terms of the plan of improvement, riparian owners whose lands would border the new stream, were given the right or privilege of constructing docks or retaining walls for their use upon the harbor line, and to excavate the bank in front thereof to the depth necessary to permit vessels to lie alongside. These requests were denied; and the United States excepted.\n We are of opinion that the giving of these instructions and the refusal of these requests involved prejudicial error. It is well settled that in the absence of a controlling local law otherwise limiting the rights of a riparian owner upon a navigable river, Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1, 40\n, 14 S. Ct. 548, he has, in addition to the rights common to the public a property right, incident to his ownership of the bank, of access from the front of his land to the navigable part of the stream, and when not forbidden by public law may construct landings, wharves or piers for this purpose. Dutton v. Strong, 1 Black, 23; Railroad Co. v. Schurmeier, 7 Wall. 272, 289; Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497, 504; Transportation Co. v. Parkersburg, \n107 \nU.S. 691, 699\n, 2 S. Ct. 732; St. Louis v. Rutz, \n138 \nU.S. 226, 246\n, 11 S. Ct. 337; Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, \n146 \nU.S. 387, 445\n, 13 S. Ct. 110; Weems Steamboat Co. v. Peoples' Co., \n214 \nU.S. 345, 355\n, 29 S. Ct. 661, 16 Ann. Cas. 1222; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 70\n, 33 S. Ct. 667. There is no limitation upon this right of a riparian owner in the laws of Michigan. On the contrary it was recognized in Lorman v. Benson, 8 Mich. 18, 25, 77 Am. Dec. 435, that the rights of riparian owners must be determined by the common law so far as applicable to the local situation; and in Ryan v. Brown, 18 Mich. 196, 210, 100 Am. Dec. 154, it was said that:\n'If wharves and similar conveniences were not allowed upon our large \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 419]\n\u00a0\n streams, the shipping business would become practically worthless. It can never be unlawful for a land owner to make such wharves and landlings as will accommodate all vessels ordinarily using the stream, unless there are some exceptional circumstances, as narrows, bends, or the like, which may in particular cases render his structures improper.'\n\n This right of a riparian owner, it is true, is subordinate to the public right of navigation, and subject to the general rules and regulations imposed for the protection of such public right. And it is of no avail against the exercise of the absolute power of Congress over the improvement of navigable rivers, but must suffer the consequences of the improvement of navigation, if Congress determines that its continuance is detrimental to the public interest in the navigation of the river. United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., supra, 62, 70 (33 S. Ct. 667).\n The right of the United States in the navigable waters within the several States is, however, 'limited to the control thereof for purposes of navigation.' Port of Seattle v. Oregon Railroad, \n255 \nU.S. 56, 63\n, 41 S. Ct. 237, 239 (65 L. Ed. 500). And while Congress, in the exercise of this power, may adopt, in its judgment, any means having some positive relation to the control of navigation and not otherwise inconsistent with the Constitution, United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., supra, 62 (33 S. Ct. 667), it may not arbitrarily destroy or impair the rights of riparian owners by legislation which has no real or substantial relation to the control of navigation or appropriateness to that end. In Yates v. Milwaukee, supra, 504, it was said in reference to the right of a riparian owner of a navigable stream:\n'This riparian right is property, and is valuable, and, though it must be enjoyed in due subjection to the rights of the public, it cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously destroyed or impaired.'\n\n This language was cited with approval in Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, supra, 445 (13 S. Ct. 110). \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 420]\n\u00a0\n Considering the charge of the court in the light of these general principles, we find that it was permeated by the fundamental error, emphasized by the refusal of the requests, that the jury were left to determine the amount of the benefits to be deducted on the theory that a riparian owner on the improved river would have merely such uncertain and contingent 'privileges' of access to the navigable stream and of constructing docks fronting on the harbor line, as the Government, in the exercise of an absolute control over the navigation of the river, might see fit to allow him, instead of being instructed that he would have a right to such access and the construction and maintenance of such docks until taken away by the Government in the due exercise of its power of control over navigation. And this error was the more serious since the plan of the improvement contemplated that the improved river should become a slip for a docks and industries and recognized the right of a riparian owner to construct docks upon the harbor line; and there was nothing in the evidence indicating any probability that the Government would at any time abrogate or curtail this right in any respect.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, while stating that the trial court had over-emphasized the elements of uncertainty in the rights of riparian owners and the contingent character of these rights, was of opinion that, under all the circumstances, such over-emphasis was not sufficiently prejudicial to call for a reversal of the judgment. With this we cannot agree. The charge was not merely an over-emphasis of the contingent character of the rights of the riparian owners, but in substance an instruction that they had no rights in this respect, and could only obtain uncertain privileges, as a matter of grace. There is an essential difference between a substantial property right which may be enjoyed until taken away in the appropriate exercise of a paramount authority, and an uncertain and \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 421]\n\u00a0\n contingent privilege which may not be allowed at all. The failure to observe this distinction went to the root of the charge in reference to the deduction of benefits. And its natural, if not inevitable, effect, was to lead the jury to a lower estimate of the benefits than would have been made under a proper charge.\n The present case is not controlled by the provision of section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 26, 1919,5 that in an appellate proceeding judgment shall be given after an examination of the entire record, 'without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' We need not enter upon a discussion of the divergent views which have been expressed in various Circuit Courts of Appeals as to the effect of the Act of 1919. It suffices to say that since the passage of this Act, as well as before, an error which relates, not to merely formal or technical matters, but to the substantial rights of the parties-especially when embodied in the charge to a jury-is to he held a ground for reversal, unless it appears from the whole record that it was harmless and did not prejudice the rights of the complaining party. See Yazoo Railroad v. Mullins, \n249 \nU.S. 531, 533\n, 39 S. Ct. 368; Fillippon v. Albion Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76, 82\n, 39 S. Ct. 435. In the present case the error in the charge could not but mislead the jury in reference to a material element necessary for its consideration in determining the amounts of the awards; and it cannot be said from the whole record that the substantial rights of the United States were not prejudiced thereby. The judgments of the District Court should therefore have been reversed, and new trials granted.\n\n 3. \nIt is unnecessary to set forth various errors assigned as to other rulings of the trial court. These matters were fully and carefully considered by the Circuit Court of \n\n[269 U.S. 411, 422]\n\u00a0\n Appeals, and we are entirely satisfied with the conclusions which it reached in reference to them.\n The judgments of the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Judgments reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 250, 258, c. 49,  1. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The appropriation was made on condition that the 'local interests' should donate the necessary land and settle all claims for damages.

Mr. \n\n[269 U.S. 315, 326]\n\u00a0\n Robbins was married and the income taxed came from community property in California, acquired before 1917, when some changes were made in the law, and from the earnings of R. Robbins. He was required by the Treasury Department to return and pay the tax upon the whole income, against the effort of Mr. and Mrs. Robbins to file returns each of one-half. The result was that he had to pay the amount sued for, above what would have had to be paid if his contention had been allowed. The District Court found the facts as agreed by the parties and upon them ruled that the plaintiffs, the executors of Robbins, were entitled to recover as matter of law. Robbins v.

That she has vested rights has been determined by this Court with reference to some jurisdictions, Warburton v. White, \n176 \nU.S. 484\n, 20 S. Ct. 404; Arnett v. Reade, \n220 \nU.S. 311\n, 31 S.

Regulations 65 relating to the Invome Tax under the Revenue Act of 1924, art. 31. Its adoption of a different rule for California was based, we presume, upon the notion that in that State a wife had a mere expectancy while the husband was alive.\n If on the whole this notion seems to us to be adopted by the California courts it is our duty to follow it, so far as material, even if contrary expressions should be found here or there in the books; and it is no concern of ours whether the prevailing decision is a legitimate descendant from its parent the Spanish law or otherwise. We can see no sufficient reason to doubt that the settled opinion of \n\n[269 U.S. 315, 327]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court of California, at least with reference to the time before the later statutes, is that the wife had a mere expectancy while living with her husband. The latest decision that we have seen dealing directly with the matter explicitly takes that view, says that it is a rule of property that has been settled for more than 60 years, and shows that Arnett v. Reade, \n220 \nU.S. 311\n, 31 S. Ct. 425, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1040, would not be followed in that State. Roberts v. Wehmeyer, 191 Cal. 601, 611, 614, 218 P. 22. In so doing it accords with the intimations of earlier cases, and does no more then embody the commonly prevailing understanding with regard to California law as shown by commentators and the action of the Treasury Department, as well as by the declarations of the Court. McKay, Community Property, section xi, p. 44; 35 Harvard Law Review, 47, 48; Treasury Regulations 65 Relating to the Income Tax under the Revenue Act of 1924, art. 31; Rice v. McCarthy (Cal. App.) 239 P. 56.\n But the question before us is with regard to the power and intent of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, title II, part II  210, 211, 40 Stat. 1057, 1062 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 e, 6336 1\/8 ee ). Even if we are wrong as to the law of California and assume that the wife had an interest in the community income that Congress could tax if so minded, it does not follow that Congress could not tax the husband for the whole. Although restricted in the matter of gifts, etc., he alone has the disposition of the fund. He may spend it substantially as he chooses, and if he wastes it in debauchery the wife has no redress. See Garrozi v. Dastas, \n204 \nU.S. 64\n, 27 S. Ct. 224. His liability for His wife's support comes from a different source and exists whether there is community property or not. That he may be taxed for such a fund seems to us to need no argument. The same and further considerations lead to the conclusion that it was intended to tax him for the whole. For not only should he who has all the power bear the burden, and not only is the \n\n[269 U.S. 315, 328]\n\u00a0\n husband the most obvious target for the shaft, but the fund taxed, while liable to be taken for his debts, is not liable to be taken for the wife's, Civil Code,  167, so that the remedy for her failure to pay might be hard to find. The reasons for holding him are at least as strong as those for holding trustees in the cases where they are liable under the law. Section 219 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 ii).

STORRS(1926)\nNo. 95\nArgued: Decided: December 13, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 652, 653]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n Messrs. Mahlon E. Wilson, Dan B. Shields, and Albert R. Barnes, all of Salt Lake City, Utah, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendants in error were indicted for conspiracy to violate and violation of section 215 of the Penal Code (Comp. St.  10385), punishing use of the mails for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud. They pleaded in abatement that when the grand jurors were investigating the charge the official court stenographer was present and took down the evidence; that the district attorney was also present and undertook to give a summary of the evidence to the grand jurors, and that he advised them that any indictment, if found, must be against all the defendants named. On these grounds it was prayed that the indictment be abated and that the defendants should not be required to answer the same. The District Court overruled a demurrer, sustained the plea on the evidence and entered judgment that the indictment be abated. It is certified in the record that when the judgment was entered the statute of limitations had run and that therefore the United States will be barred from further prosecution of the defendants. The United States brings this writ of \n\n[272 U.S. 652, 654]\n\u00a0\n error on the ground that in these circumstances the plea was in substance a 'special plea in bar' within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 St. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704).\n It is true that there is less strictness now in dealing with a plea in abatement than there was a hundred years ago. The question is less what it is called than what it is. But while the quality of an act depends upon its circumstances the quality of the plea depends upon its contents. As was said at the argument, it cannot be that a plea filed a week earlier is what it purports to be, and in its character is, but a week later becomes a plea in bar because of the extrinsic circumstance that the statute of limitations has run. The plea looks only to abating the indictment not to barring the action. It has no greater effect in any circumstances. If another indictment cannot be brought, that is not because of the judgment on the plea, but is an independent result of a fact having no relation to the plea and working equally whether there was a provious indictment or not. The statute uses technical words, 'a special plea in bar' and we see no reason for not taking them in their technical sense. This plea is not a plea in bar and the statute does not cover the case.\n The Government bases its argument upon United States v. Thompson, \n251 \nU.S. 407\n, 40 S. Ct. 289. In that case an indictment was quashed by the trial court upon motion on the ground that the same counts had been submitted to a previous grand jury and no presentment had been made, and that they could not be submitted to a second grand jury without leave of Court, which had not been obtained. It so happened that a further prosecution upon these counts would be barred by the statute of limitations, although other counts had been presented in the first case upon which a trial still might be had. This Court held that the motion to quash amounted to a plea \n\n[272 U.S. 652, 655]\n\u00a0\n in bar since the facts alleged barred any later proceeding by the United States, according to the law laid down by the trial Court, except upon a condition that was held by this Court to be improperly imposed. Perhaps the decision went to the extreme point, but is was put on the contents of the plea seen in the light of the law applied, not on the fact that the statute of limitations had run. It was said that the United States had the right to present and the grand jury had the right to entertain the charges without leave of court and that the necessary effect of this judgment 'was to bar the absolute right of the United States to prosecute by subjecting the exercise of that right, not only as to this indictment but as to all subsequent ones for the same offenses, to a limitation resulting from the exercise of the Judicial power upon which the judgment was based.' \n251 \nU.S. 412\n, 40 S. Ct. 291 (64 L. Ed. 333). It was added that the same was true as to the authority of the district attorney and the powers of the grand jury 'since the exercise in both case of lawful authority was barred by the application of unauthorized judicial discretion.' We are of the opinion that this decision interposes no obstacle to what seems to us the natural interpretation of the law.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","212":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. WYCKOFF PIPE & CREOSOTING CO.(1926)\nNo. 282\nArgued: April 29, 1926Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William J. Donovan, and Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Attys. Gen., and Edward D. Hays, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Harvey D. Jacob, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Wyckoff Pipe & Creosoting Company, Inc., contracted with the United States, in December, 1917, to lay creosoted wood block floors in Navy Yard buildings at Norfolk, Va., furnishing all necessary labor and materials. On a part of the job the contractor was to begin the work immediately after delivery of a copy of the contract. This part was to be completed within 30 days thereafter. On other parts, work was to be deferred until such time as the government was ready to proceed. These parts were to be finished within 43 days from the dates on which they were begun. The flooring was to be set in a concrete base which was to be laid promptly by the government. The contractor prepared itself immediately to perform the contract. Among other things, it purchased the lumber and creosote oil needed for the job. Long delays by the government in furnishing the con- \n\n[271 U.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n crete bases prevented performance by the contractor. Thus more than two years elapsed before the work was completed. The contractor was without fault.\n The government's delays confessedly caused the contractor some loss. For the loss so suffered the government was confessedly liable. It made payment at the fixed contract rate of $2.26 per square yard-and paid an additional amount, also provided by the contract, equal to 50 per cent. of the estimated increase in the labor cost. It paid nothing otherwise on account of the damages caused by its delay. To recover compensation for the loss suffered, this suit on the contract was brought in the Court of Claims in January, 1923. That court assessed the damages at $10,122.99, and for that amount it entered judgment, without an opinion, on June 2, 1924. 59 Ct. Cl. 980. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219). The only question presented is whether there was error in the measure of damages adopted.\n The findings of fact recite that the contractor, in reserving its right to claim damages for extras by reason of the long unanticipated delay, had enumerated as items of the proposed claim extra labor on account of the advance in the scale of wages, extra expense by reason of renewal premiums on surety company bonds, additional freight rates on sand and other material, additional cost of sand, additional cost of creosote oil, storage, insurance, and carrying charges 'on a large stock of lumber purchased for the account of your contract and carried in our yard for a space of between one and two years.' The findings also recite that the record does not disclose by items the amount of extra expense incurred by the contractor by reason of the lengthy delay in the performance of the work. The court made no finding or estimate of the loss so incurred. It found merely that the increase in the prevailing market price of lumber from the time \n\n[271 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n that used was bought by the contractor until it was actually employed on the job was $6,021.23; that the increase in the prevailing market price of the creosote oil required from the time it was purchased for the job until it actually was so used amounted to $712.59; that the reasonable value of the contract work per square yard at the time it was actually performed was, for a part $2.68, for a part $2.98, and for the rest $3.28; and that the reasonable value of the whole work at the time it was done by the contractor, based upon prices then paid by the government on other work then done at the Navy Yard, was $9,936.54 in excess of the amount which the contractor had received. It was for this sum of $9,936.54, plus an item of $186.45 about which there is no dispute, that the Court of Claims entered its judgment of $10,122.99.\n The government contends that recovery cannot be had on the contract for the higher market value of the work at the time it was actually performed; that the correct measure of damages for its delay is the loss actually sustained by the contractor as the result of the delay (United States v. Smith, \n94 U.S. 214\n; United States v. Mueller, \n113 \nU.S. 153\n, 5 S. Ct. 380; Ripley v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 695\n, 32 S. Ct. 352); that the increase in the market value of materials purchased for use on the contract cannot be deemed a loss; and that to assess damages on the basis of the value of the work at the time it was performed was, in effect, to make a new contract for the parties or to allow recovery as upon quantum meruit. The contention is, in our opinion, well founded.\n The contractor urges that the long delay was a breach which would have justified it in terminating the contract and refusing to do the work except under a new one at an increased price. But, despite a contention to the contrary, it did not do this. It completed the work under the contract as originally made. It did not attempt to \n\n[271 U.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n make a new contract, or to modify the existing one. It sought merely to reserve its right to make a claim for the damages resulting from the government's delay. After completing performance it brought this suit declaring on the original contract.\n The contractor urges also that, because of the delay, it might have used the supplies purchased on another job, receiving on that their then market value, or might have sold them and taken the incidental profit due to the rise in values; and that, if it had done either and had been obliged later to purchase new supplies at the higher market values in order to perform the government job, the increased cost would have been recoverable as a loss; and that, as the amount of this increase has been found, the recovery should be sustained at least to that extent. The contractor's contentions, however, ignore the rule that damages for delay are limited to the actual losses incurred. The contractor elected to hold itself in readiness to perform its contract and to this end to retain both the lumber and the creosote oil. The carrying charges thus incurred are an allowable item of damage; but these were not shown. It may even be that in the event of a use or resale of the supplies, if under the circumstances such a course of action was open to the contractor, the profits made would have been available in reduction of damages. Compare Erie County Natural Gas & Fuel Co. v. Carroll (1911) App. Cas. 105. But clearly it cannot now charge as a loss profits which it might have made if it had sold the supplies in the market or used them on another job.\n It is argued that the Court of Claims is under no obligation when assessing damages to specify the elements of the calculation by which it arrives at its results; that itemization is often impossible, and that, like a jury, the court may make an estimate and return such sum as the damages recoverable (compare United States v. Smith, 94 \n\n[271 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 214, 219); and that, accepting the rule that damages are to be limited to actual loss, the award of the lower court is to be regarded as an estimate of such loss. But, in the case at bar, the court did not pursue that course. It made no estimate of the loss suffered. It found merely the increase in value of the work at the time it was performed and the increase in value of the material during the period of the delay. Then it found and concluded, as a matter of law, that the excess of the reasonable value of the work at the time it was done over the amount paid therefor, was recoverable as damages. This was error.\n The judgment must be reversed. As there are no findings from which the amount of the loss can be determined, the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Ralph Rymer, of Scranton, Pa., and John Davis and James M. Nicely, both of New York City, for Zerbey and National Surety Co.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes before us on a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals. Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216).\n It appears from the certificate that Zerbey on January 23, 1920, applied to the Commission of Internal Revenue, under the provisions of the National Prohibition Act,1 for a permit to sell distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, and filed with his application a bond in the sum of $100,000, with the National Surety Company as surety. This bond was on Form 738, previously prescribed by the regulations, and recited, in accordance therewith that 'the conditions of this obligation is such that if the said principal shall fully and faithfully comply with all the requirements of the laws of the United States now or hereafter enacted and regulations issues pursuant thereto, respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, then this obligation to be void; otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.' On January 26, the Commissioner issued to Zerbey a permit 'under the conditions that the provisions of the National Prohibition Act, and regulations issued thereunder, will be strictly observed.'\n Thereafter the United States brought an action against Zerbey and the Surety Company in a Federal District Court, in which it was alleged that Zerbey had violated the condition of the bond in (a) failing and neglecting to keep records of his sales of distilled spirits, as required by the Prohibition Act and regulations, (b) selling and \n\n[271 U.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n disposing of distilled spirits for beverage purposes, (c) diverting distilled spirits to other than beverage purposes, and (d) having in his possession whisky which had been withdrawn, for nonbeverage purposes only, from a bonded warehouse, of which he kept no record as required by the Prohibition Act and regulations; and that the full penal sum of the bond had been forfeited and was due by the defendants to the United States by reason of these breaches of the condition of the bond. It was not alleged that any damage or loss had been sustained by the United States as the result of these breaches. The defendants filed statutory demurrers, which were sustained by the District Court on the ground that the United States could not recover the full penal sum of the bond, but only such loss or damage as it had sustained in consequence of the breaches of the bond; and the suit was dismissed. And the case having been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals by writ of error, it has certified that, for the proper decision of the case, it desires the instruction of this Court as to the following questions of law:\n'(1) Is a bond conditioned upon compliance with the law of the United States and regulations issued pursuant thereto, respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, given the United States by one to whom a permit to sell intoxicating liquors for other than beverage purposes has been issued under the provisions of section 6 of Title 2 of the National Prohibition Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, forfeitable upon breach of the condition in the full amount of its penal sum? (2) Is recovery upon breach of the condition of such a bond given by one holding such a permit limited to actual damages sustained by the United States?'\n\n These questions, shortly stated, are, in effect: Whether a permit bond on Form 738 is a forfeiture bond entitling the United States to recover the full amount named on a \n\n[271 U.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n breach of its condition, or a bond of indemnity for the actual damages sustained by the United States from such breach.\n Section 6, Title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 c) provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that:\n'No one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the Commissioner so to do. ... The Commission may prescribe the form of all permits and applications and the facts to be set forth therein. Before any permit is granted the Commissioner may require a bond in such form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and the provisions of this title.'\n\n By Title 2,  29 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 p), it is further provided that any person violating the provisions of any permit or of this title, shall be punished by either fine or imprisonment, or both; and, by Title 2,  35 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 v), that a tax shall be assessed against any person responsible for an illegal sale in double the amount provided by the internal revenue law, with an additional penalty.\n By regulations issued by the Commissioner in October and November, 1919,2 every applicant for a permit for the sale or use of distilled spirits or wines, for other than beverage purposes, was required to furnish either a bond with corporate or personal sureties, on Form 738, in a penal sum of from $1,000 to $100,000, computed, at specified rates, on the quantity of spirits and wine which he then had on hand or would receive in the next quarterly period; or his personal bond for the same amount, secured by the deposit of Government bonds as collateral security.\n Form 738 prescribed for a surety bond-which was used by Zerbey-was conditioned, as previously stated, that the principal 'shall fully and faithfully comply with \n\n[271 U.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n all the requirements of the laws of the United States now or hereafter enacted, and regulations issued pursuant thereto respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes.' The corresponding Form 738A prescribed for a collateral bond, recited the pledge of Government bonds 'as security for any obligation arising hereunder,' and contained, after the general condition in Form 738, a specific provision that 'the said principal expressly agrees that the said bonds so deposited may be sold ... and the proceeds applied to the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, and penalties which may be due, and in satisfaction of any liabilities incurred hereunder, and the expenses of such sale, if any; and the residue, if any, paid to the said principal.'\n Thereafter, by Regulations No. 60,3 which, dated January 16, 1920, were not, it appears, published and put into effect until February 1-after the issuance of the permit of Zerbey-an applicant for a permit to sell or use distilled spirits or wines was required to file either a surety bond on a new Form 1408 or a collateral bond on a new Form 1409; provided that if the holder of such a permit had already given a bond on Form 738 or Form 738A in a sufficient penal sum, a new bond should not be required until he was called upon to make an application for a new permit.\n The Form 1408 thus prescribed for a surety bond,4 recites that:\n'The condition of this obligation is such that if ... the said principal shall not violate the terms of such permit ... or ... any of the provisions of the National Prohibition Act and regulations promulgated thereunder as now or hereafter provided, and all other laws of the United States nor or hereafter enacted respecting distilled spirits, fermented liquors, wines, or \n\n[271 U.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n other intoxicating liquors, and will pay all taxes, assessments, fines, and penalties incurred or imposed upon him by law, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.'\n\n And Form 1409 prescribed for a collateral bond likewise provides that upon the sale of the Government's bonds pledged as security, the proceeds, shall 'be applied to the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, fines and penalties which may be due, and in satisfaction of any liabilities incurred hereunder and the expenses of such sale, if any, and the residue, if any, paid to said principal.'\n The case now presented is not that of a bond executed to the Government in a specified penal sum prescribed by statute and intended as a fixed penalty imposed for a breach of a statutory duty, which is forfeited in its full amount by a breach of the condition irrespective of the actual damage thereby caused the Government. Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 461\n, 2 S. Ct. 878; United States v. Dieckerhoff, \n202 \nU.S. 302, 309\n, 26 S. Ct. 604; United States v. Montell (Taney, 47) 26 Fed. Cas. 1293, 1296. Whether Congress did or could authorize the Commissioner in fixing the form of bond to prescribe a penalty, we need no consider; for here it is plain that he did not intend that the penal sum of a surety bond on Form 738 should be a penalty or liquidated damages-in this case of $100,000-the full amount of which the United States might recover for any breach of condition, however slight, as, for example, a failure to make a record of sany sale as required by the regulations; but, on the contrary, intended that such penal sum should be the maximum amount of the obligation incurred by reason of a breach of the bond. Form 738 is unquestionably to be read in connection with Form 738A. These were prescribed by the same regulations as alternative forms of the bond which the applicant might at his election furnish. They had precisely the same object, and were intended to secure the same obligation; \n\n[271 U.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n the one by personal sureties, the other by the deposit of collateral. Plainly it was not intended that the obligation should be greater in the one case than in the other, merely because the applicant chose to furnish personal instead of collateral security. The effect of Form 738A is that the applicant's obligation shall be discharged by the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, penalties and liabilities accruing to the United States by reason of a breach of the condition; and it cannot be doubted that this was intended, in like manner, to be the measure of the obligation incurred under a surety bond on the corresponding Form 738.\n This view is emphasized by the consideration of the new Forms 1408 and 1409 prescribed by Regulations 60. It is clear that Form 1408 is not one for a penalty or forfeiture, but is one for indemnity merely in respect, broadly speaking, of the liabilities enumerated in Form 738A. United States v. Chouteau, \n102 U.S. 603\n, 608. And the fact that these new regulations provided that a permit holder who had previously given a surety bond on Form 738 should not be required to give a new bond on Form 1408 until called upon to make application for a new permit, is strongly persuasive evidence that the Commissioner regarded Form 738 as of substantially the same character as Form 1408 that is, as a bond for indemnity securing the payment of the liabilities enumerated in Form 738A.\n Our answer to the certified questions is that: A permit bond on Form 738 is not a bond for a penalty forfeitable in its entire amount upon a breach of condition, but is a bond for indemnity securing the payment of the internal revenue taxes, interest, penalties, and liabilities accruing to the United States by reason of the breach. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 41 Stat. 305, c. 85 (Comp.

Clyde Brown, an associate of the dealers, was permitted by them, with the knowledge of plaintiff in error, to make frequent use of the automobile. Brown was arrested by state officers, and an information was filed charging that he used an automobile (which was plaintiff's) for the illegal transportation of intoxicating liquor and seeking its forfeiture and sale as a common nuisance under the Kansas statute. Laws Kan. 1919, c. 217,  1-6; sections 21-2162 to 21-2167, R. S. Plaintiff intervened, denying the allegations of the information and setting up her ownership of the automobile and that the transportation of intoxicating liquor, if any, was without her knowledge or authority.\n A trial by the district court of Finney county without a jury, as provided by the Kansas statute, resulted in a judgment of forfeiture. This determination was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Kansas. State v. (Brown) Van Oster, 119 Kan. 874, 241 P. 112. After this decision, but prior to a petition for rehearing subsequently denied, Brown was acquitted by a jury of the offense charged in the information. The case comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code, 237(a), as amended (Comp. St.  1214).\n The Kansas statute, cited above, declares that an automobile or other vehicle used in the state in the transportation of intoxicating liquor is a common nuisance, and establishes a procedure followed in this case for its forfeiture and sale. The Kansas Supreme Court in this, as in other cases, State v. Peterson, 107 Kan. 641, 193 P. 342; State v. Stephens, 109 Kan. 254, 198 P. 1087, has construed this act as authorizing the forfeiture of the interest of an innocent owner or lienor in property intrusted to the wrongdoer.\n It is contended that the statute as interpreted denies the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute is further assailed on the ground that it is repugnant to the provisions of the National Prohi- \n\n[272 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n bition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/4 et seq.), which covers the same field; and, finally, objection is made that evidence of the intoxicating character of the liquor transported was lacking, and that the acquittal of Brown establishes beyond contradiction that no crime was committed.\n It is not questioned that a state in the exercise of its police may forfeit property used by its owner in violation of state laws prohibiting the liquor traffic. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1\n, 9 S. Ct. 6, cf. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 671\n, 8 S. Ct. 273, et seq., Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133\n, 14 S. Ct. 499. It is unnecessary for us to inquire whether the police power of the state extends to the confiscation of the property of innocent persons appropriated and used by the law breaker without the owner's consent, for here the offense of unlawful transportation was committed by one intrusted by the owner with the possession and use of the offending vehicle.\n It is not unknown, or indeed uncommon, for the law to visit upon the owner of property the unpleasant consequences of the unauthorized action of one to whom he has intrusted it. Much of the jurisdiction in admiralty, so much of the statute and common law of liens as enables a mere bailee to subject the bailed property to a lien, the power of a vendor of chattels in possession to sell and convey good title to a stranger, are familiar examples. They have their counterpart in legislation imposing liability on owners of vehicles for the negligent operation by those intrusted with their use, regardless of a master-servant relation. Laws of New York, 1924, c. 534; Pub. Acts Mich. 1915, Act No. 302,  29 (constitutionality upheld, Stapleton v. Independent Brewing Co., 198 Mich. 170, 164 N. W. 520, L. R. A. 1918A, 916). They suggest that certain uses of property may be regarded so undesirable that the owner surrenders his control at his peril. The law thus builds a secondary defense against a forbidden use and precludes evasions by dispensing with the necessity of judicial inquiry as \n\n[272 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n to collusion between the wrongdoer and the alleged innocent owner. So here the legislature, to effect a purpose clearly within its power, had adopted a device consonant with recognized principles and therefore within the limits of due process.\n It has long been settled that statutory forfeitures of property intrusted by the innocent owner or lienor to another who uses it in violation of the revenue laws of the United States is not a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

One Buick Roadster Automobile ( D. C.) 244 F. 961; United States v. One Seven Passenger Paige Car (D. C.) 259 F. 641.\n We do not perceive any valid distinction between the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to the exercise of the police power of a state in this particular field and the application of the Fifth Amendment to the similar exercise of the taxing power by the federal government, or any reason for holding that the one is not as plenary as the other. See Hibben v. Smith, \n191 \nU.S. 310, 325\n, 24 S. Ct. 88, Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401, 410\n, 26 S. Ct. 66. And see Kidd v. Pearson, supra, at page 26 (9 S.

Ct. 475, a tax case.\n The mere fact that the statute now in question has a broader scope than section 26 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St.  10138 1\/2 mm), \n\n[272 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n authorizing confiscation of vehicles used in unlawful transportation of liquor, does not affect its validity. In Hebert v. State of Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312\n, 47 S. Ct. 103, 71 L. Ed. -, decided this term, it was held that the same transaction may constitute separate offenses against both state and federal sovereignties, and that in separate prosecutions the statutes of that sovereignty under whose auspices the proceedings are instituted are alone to be applied.

Ct. 330.\n The other questions raised by the record, as to the sufficiency of the evidence and the effect of the acquittal of Brown on his separate trial, at most involved questions of state procedure only as to which the decision of the state court is controlling. No tenable ground for attacking the constitutionality of the determination is suggested. In the brief and on the argument an attempt was made to question the constitutionality of the provisions of this statute dispensing with a jury trial in the forfeiture proceeding. But the record does not indicate that a jury trial was demanded and the question is not raised by the assignments of error. In any case the objection is unsubstantial. Missouri ex rel. Hurwitz v.

West, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of a federal District Court dismissing a suit for want of jurisdiction. The suit was begun in a state court, and then removed into the federal court, on the defendant's petition, by reason of the diverse citizenship of the parties. Want of jurisdiction was adjudged, because the court was of opinion that the suit was essentially one to annul or set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission made under section 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act, as added by Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 494,  439 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8592a); that the United States was a necessary defendant and had not consented to be sued in a state court; and that the removal did not give the federal court jurisdiction, when the state court had none.\n A short description of the suit as displayed in the plaintiff's amended bill will suffice to show its nature. The plaintiff is a minority stockholder of a railway company which owns and operates an interstate railroad, and that company is the sole defendant. The purpose with which the suit is brought is to enjoin the defendant company from carrying out an agreement with two other railroad companies under which the three, collectively \n\n[271 U.S. 127, 129]\n\u00a0\n styled 'New York Central Lines,' are to acquire a large number of locomotives for use on their respective roads in both interstate and intrastate commerce; are to obtain money to pay for this equipment by issuing certificates, payable at intervals during a period of 15 years, with semiannual dividend warrants representing interest; and are to covenant jointly and severally to pay rentals for the equipment sufficient to pay the certificates and dividend warrants as they mature. On application by the three companies pursuant to section 20a, the Interstate Commerce Commission, after notice and investigation, made an order approving the agreement and authorizing the acts contemplated therein. The order was made the day before the suit was begun.\n The plaintiff alleges in his amended bill that to issue the certificates and provide for their payment in the manner proposed will be in violation of the laws of the state wherein the defendant company was incorporated and of the other states into which its road extends, unless the approval of designated agencies of those states be secured; that such approval has not been and is not intended to be secured; and that the defendant company is relying on the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and is proceeding to carry out the agreement as approved by that order. He also alleges that the order, and the provisions of section 20a, under which it was made, transcend the limits of federal power, and encroach on the power of the states before named. The prayer is that the defendant company be enjoined from carrying out the agreement, notwithstanding its approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission under that section.\n The defendant challenged the court's jurisdiction by a motion to dismiss on the grounds before stated, and it was on consideration of that motion that the decree of dismissal was entered. The decree was entered and the \n\n[271 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n present appeal was allowed prior to the change made in our appellate jurisdiction by the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936).\n By section 20a the Commission is empowered to entertain an application by any carrier by railroad engaged in interstate commerce for authority to issue bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, or to asume obligations or liabilities as a lessor or lessee, or as a guarantor or surety of another carrier, and is further empowered, after notice to 'the Governor of each state in which the applicant carrier operates,' and on due investigation, to grant or refuse such authority in whole or in part, and thereafter, for good cause shown, to make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may deem necessary or appropriate. The section also provides:\n'(7) The jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by this section shall be exclusive and plenary, and a carrier may issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities in accordance with the provisions of this section without securing approval other than as specified herein.'\n\n We agree with the court below that the suit is essentially one to annul or set aside the order of the Commission. While the amended bill does not expressly pray that the order be annulled or set aside, it does assail the validity of the order and pray that the defendant company be enjoined from doing what the order specifically authorizes, which is equivalent to asking that the order be adjudged invalid and set aside.

In the second this court dealt in a single opinion with two distinct proceedings. One was a suit to set aside an order of the Commission, and was brought against the United States and a railroad company in the proper federal District Court. The other was a prior and related suit brought in a state court against the railroad company and removed into another federal District Court before the order was made by the Commission. Afterwards, when the order was made, its interpretation and operation were drawn in question in that suit. The question of jurisdiction, with which we are concerned here, was not raised there, and there is doubt that it could have been.\n We hold that the dismissal for want of jurisdiction was right.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","216":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVILLAGE OF EUCLID, OHIO v. AMBLER REALTY CO.(1926)\nNo. 31\nArgued: October 12, 1926Decided: November 22, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 365, 367]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James Metzenbaum, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellants.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 365, 371]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Newton D. Baker and Robert M. Morgan, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 365, 379]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The village of Euclid is an Ohio municipal corporation. It adjoins and practically is a suburb of the city of Cleveland. Its estimated population is between 5,000 and 10,000, and its area from 12 to 14 square miles, the greater part of which is farm lands or unimproved acreage. It lies, roughly, in the form of a parallelogram measuring approximately 3 1\/2 miles each way. East and west it is traversed by three principal highways: Euclid avenue, through the southerly border, St. Clair avenue, through the central portion, and Lake Shore boulevard, through the northerly border, in close proximity to the shore of Lake Erie. The Nickel Plate Railroad lies from 1,500 to 1,800 feet north of Euclid avenue, and the Lake Shore Railroad 1,600 feet farther to the north. The three highways and the two railroads are substantially parallel.\n Appellee is the owner of a tract of land containing 68 acres, situated in the westerly end of the village, abutting on Euclid avenue to the south and the Nickel Plate Railroad to the north. Adjoining this tract, both on the east and on the west, there have been laid out restricted residential plats upon which residences have been erected.\n On November 13, 1922, an ordinance was adopted by the village council, establishing a comprehensive zoning plan for regulating and restricting the location of trades, \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 380]\n\u00a0\n industries, apartment houses, two-family houses, single family houses, etc ., the lot area to be built upon, the size and height of buildings, etc.\n The entire area of the village is divided by the ordinance into six classes of use districts, denominated U-1 to U-6, inclusive; three classes of height districts, denominated H-1 to H-3, inclusive; and four classes of area districts, denominated A-1 to A-4, inclusive. The use districts are classified in respect of the buildings which may be erected within their respective limits, as follows: U-1 is restricted to single family dwellings, public parks, water towers and reservoirs, suburban and interurban electric railway passenger stations and rights of way, and farming, non-commercial greenhouse nurseries, and truck gardening; U-2 is extended to include two-family dwellings; U-3 is further extended to include apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, public libraries, museums, private clubs, community center buildings, hospitals, sanitariums, public playgrounds, and recreation buildings, and a city hall and courthouse; U-4 is further extended to include banks, offices, studios, telephone exchanges, fire and police stations, restaurants, theaters and moving picture shows, retail stores and shops, sales offices, sample rooms, wholesale stores for hardware, drugs, and groceries, stations for gasoline and oil (not exceeding 1,000 gallons storage) and for ice delivery, skating rinks and dance halls, electric substations, job and newspaper printing, public garages for motor vehicles, stables and wagon sheds (not exceeding five horses, wagons or motor trucks), and distributing stations for central store and commercial enterprises; U-5 is further extended to include billboards and advertising signs (if permitted), warehouses, ice and ice cream manufacturing and cold storage plants, bottling works milk bottling and central distribution stations, laundries, carpet cleaning, dry cleaning, and dyeing establishments, \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 381]\n\u00a0\n blacksmith, horseshoeing, wagon and motor vehicle repair shops, freight stations, street car barns, stables and wagon sheds (for more than five horses, wagons or motor trucks), and wholesale produce markets and salesroom; U-6 is further extended to include plants for sewage disposal and for producing gas, garbage and refuse incineration, scrap iron, junk, scrap paper, and rag storage, aviation fields, cemeteries, crematories, penal and correctional institutions, insane and feeble-minded institutions, storage of oil and gasoline (not to exceed 25,000 gallons), and manufacturing and industrial operations of any kind other than, and any public utility not included in, a class U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, or U-5 use. There is a seventh class of uses which is prohibited altogether.\n Class U-1 is the only district in which buildings are restricted to those enumerated. In the other classes the uses are cumulative-that is to say, uses in class U-2 include those enumerated in the preceding class U-1; class U-3 includes uses enumerated in the preceding classes, U-2, and U-1; and so on. In addition to the enumerated uses, the ordinance provides for accessory uses; that is, for uses customarily incident to the principal use, such as private garages. Many regulations are provided in respect of such accessory uses.\n The height districts are classified as follows: In class H-1, buildings are limited to a height of 2 1\/2 stories, or 35 feet; in class H- 2, to 4 stories, or 50 feet; in class H-3, to 80 feet. To all of these, certain exceptions are made, as in the case of church spires, water tanks, etc.\n The classification of area districts is: In A-1 districts, dwellings or apartment houses to accommodate more than one family must have at least 5,000 square feet for interior lots and at least 4,000 square feet for corner lots; in A-2 districts, the area must be at least 2,500 square feet for interior lots, and 2,000 square feet for corner lots; in A-3 \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 382]\n\u00a0\n districts, the limites are 1,250 and 1,000 square feet, respectively; in A- 4 districts, the limits are 900 and 700 square feet, respectively. The ordinance contains, in great variety and detail, provisions in respect of width of lots, front, side, and rear yards, and other matters, including restrictions and regulations as to the use of billboards, signboards, and advertising signs.\n A single family dwelling consists of a basement and not less than three rooms and a bathroom. A two-family dwelling consists of a basement and not less than four living rooms and a bathroom for each family, and is further described as a detached dwelling for the occupation of two families, one having its principal living rooms on the first floor and the other on the second floor.\n Appellee's tract of land comes under U-2, U-3 and U-6. The first strip of 620 feet immediately north of Euclid avenue falls in class U-2, the next 130 feet to the north, in U-3, and the remainder in U-6. The uses of the first 620 feet, therefore, do not include apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, or other public and semipublic buildings, or other uses enumerated in respect of U-3 to U-6, inclusive. The uses of the next 130 feet include all of these, but exclude industries, theaters, banks, shops, and the various other uses set forth in respect of U-4 to U-6, inclusive. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[272 U.S. 365, 383]\n\u00a0\n Annexed to the ordinance, and made a part of it, is a zone map, showing the location and limits of the various use, height, and area districts, from which it appears that the three classes overlap one another; that is to say, for example, both U-5 and U-6 use districts are in A-4 area district, but the former is in H-2 and the latter in H-3 height districts. The plan is a complicated one, and can be better understood by an inspection of the map, though it does not seem necessary to reproduce it for present purposes.\n The lands lying between the two railroads for the entire length of the village area and extending some distance on either side to the north and south, having an average width of about 1,600 feet, are left open, with slight exceptions, for industrial and all other uses. This includes the larger part of appellee's tract. Approximately one-sixth of the area of the entire village is included in U-5 and U-6 use districts. That part of the village lying south of Euclid avenue is principally in U-1 districts. The lands lying north of Euclid avenue and bordering on the long strip just described are included in U-1, U-2, U-3, and U-4 districts, principally in U-2.\n The enforcement of the ordinance is intrusted to the inspector of buildings, under rules and regulations of the board of zoning appeals. Meetings of the board are public, and minutes of its proceedings are kept. It is authorized to adopt rules and regulations to carry into effect provisions of the ordinance. Decisions of the inspector of buildings may be appealed to the board by any person claiming to be adversely affected by any such decision. The board is given power in specific cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to interpret the ordinance in harmony with its general purpose and intent, so that the public health, safety and general welfare may be secure and substantial justice done. Penalties are prescribed for violations, and it is provided that the various \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 384]\n\u00a0\n provisions are to be regarded as independent and the holding of any provision to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective shall not affect any of the others.\n The ordinance is assailed on the grounds that it is in derogation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution in that it deprives appellee of liberty and property without due process of law and denies it the equal protection of the law, and that it offends against certain provisions of the Constitution of the state of Ohio. The prayer of the bill is for an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinance and all attempts to impose or maintain as to appellee's property any of the restrictions, limitations or conditions. The court below held the ordinance to be unconstitutional and void, and enjoined its enforcement, 297 F. 307.\n Before proceeding to a consideration of the case, it is necessary to determine the scope of the inquiry. The bill alleges that the tract of land in question is vacant and has been held for years for the purpose of selling and developing it for industrial uses, for which it is especially adapted, being immediately in the path or progressive industrial development; that for such uses it has a market value of about $10,000 per acre, but if the use be limited to residential purposes the market value is not in excess of $2,500 per acre; that the first 200 feet of the parcel back from Euclid avenue, if unrestricted in respect of use, has a value of $ 150 per front foot, but if limited to residential uses, and ordinary mercantile business be excluded therefrom, its value is not in excess of $ 50 per front foot.\n It is specifically averred that the ordinanceattempts to restrict and control the lawful uses of appellee's land, so as to confiscate and destroy a great part of its value; that it is being enforced in accordance with its terms; that propective buyers of land for industrial, commercial, and residential uses in the metropolitan district of Cleveland \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 385]\n\u00a0\n are deterred from buying any part of this land because of the existence of the ordinance and the necessity thereby entailed of conducting burdensome and expensive litigation in order to vindicate the right to use the land for lawful and legitimate purposes; that the ordinance constitutes a cloud upon the land, reduces and destroys its value, and has the effect of diverting the normal industrial, commercial, and residential development thereof to other and less favorable locations.\n The record goes no farther than to show, as the lower court found, that the normal and reasonably to be expected use and development of that part of appellee's land adjoining Euclid avenue is for general trade and commercial purposes, particularly retail stores and like establishments, and that the normal and reasonably to be expected use and development of the residue of the land is for industrial and trade purposes. Whatever injury is inflicted by the mere existence and threatened enforcement of the ordinance is due to restrictions in respect of these and similar uses, to which perhaps should be added-if not included in the foregoing- restrictions in respect of apartment houses. Specifically there is nothing in the record to suggest that any damage results from the presence in the ordinance of those restrictions relating to churches, schools, libraries, and other public and semipublic buildings. It is neither alleged nor proved that there is or may be a demand for any part of appellee's land for any of the last-named uses, and we cannot assume the existence of facts which would justify an injunction upon this record in respect to this class of restrictions. For present purposes the provisions of the ordinance in respect of these uses may therefore be put aside as unnecessary to be considered. It is also unnecessary to consider the effect of the restrictions in respect of U-1 districts, since none of appellee's land falls within that class. \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 386]\n\u00a0\n We proceed, then, to a consideration of those provisions of the ordinance to which the case as it is made relates, first disposing of a preliminary matter.\n A motion was made in the court below to dismiss the bill on the ground that, because complainant (appellee) had made no effort to obtain a building permit or apply to the zoning board of appeals for relief, as it might have done under the terms of the ordinance, the suit was premature. The motion was properly overruled, the effect of the allegations of the bill is that the ordinance of its own force operates greatly to reduce the value of appellee's lands and destroy their marketability for industrial, commercial and residential uses, and the attack is directed, not against any specific provision or provisions, but against the ordinance as an entirety. Assuming the premises, the existence and maintenance of the ordinance in effect constitutes a present invasion of appellee's property rights and a threat to continue it. Under these circumstances, the equitable jurisdiction is clear. See Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 215\n, 44 S. Ct. 15; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 535\n, 45 S. Ct. 571, 30 A. L. R. 468.\n It is not necessary to set forth the provisions of the Ohio Constitution which are thought to be infringed. The question is the same under both Constitutions, namely, as stated by appellee: Is the ordinance invalid, in that it violates the constitutional protection 'to the right of property in the appellee by attempted regulations under the guise of the police power, which are unreasonable and confiscatory'?\n Building zone laws are of modern origin. They began in this country about 25 years ago. Until recent years, urban life was comparatively simple; but, with the great increase and concentration of population, problems have developed, and constantly are developing, which require, and will continue to require, additional restrictions in respect of the use and occupation of private lands in \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 387]\n\u00a0\n urban communities. Regulations, the wisdom, necessity, and validity of which, as applied to existing conditions, are so apparent that they are now uniformly sustained, a century ago, or even half a century ago, probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive. Such regulations are sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for reasons analogous to those which justify traffic regulations, which, before the advent of automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would have been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable. And in this there is no inconsistency, for, while the meaning of constitutional guaranties never varies, the scope of their application must expand or contract to meet the new and different conditions which are constantly coming within the field of their operation. In a changing world it is impossible that it should be otherwise. But although a degree of elasticity is thus imparted, not to the meaning, but to the application of constitutional principles, statutes and ordinances, which, after giving due weight to the new conditions, are found clearly not to conform to the Constitution, of course, must fall.\n The ordinance now under review, and all similar laws and regulations, must find their justification in some aspect of the police power, asserted for the public welfare. The line which in this field separates the legitimate from the illegitimate assumption of power is not capable of precise delimitation. It varies with circumstances and conditions. A regulatory zoning ordinance, which would be clearly valid as applied to the great cities, might be clearly invalid as applied to rural communities. In solving doubts, the maxim 'sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas,' which lies at the foundation of so much of the common low of nuisances, ordinarily will furnish a fairly helpful clew. And the law of nuisances, likewise, may be consulted, not for the purpose of controlling, but for the helpful aid of its analogies in the process of ascertaining \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 388]\n\u00a0\n the scope of, the power. Thus the question whether the power exists to forbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for a particular use, like the question whether a particular thing is a nuisance, is to be determined, not by an abstract consideration of the building or of the thing considered apart, but by considering it in connection with the circumstances and the locality. Sturgis v. Bridgeman, L. R. 11 Ch. 852, 865. A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard. If the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control. Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S. Ct. 325.\n There is no serious difference of opinion in respect of the validity of laws and regulations fixing the height of buildings within reasonable limits, the character of materials and methods of construction, and the adjoining area which must be left open, in order to minimize the danger of fire or collapse, the evils of overcrowding and the like, and excluding from residential sections offensive trades, industries and structures likely to create nuisances. See Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91\n, 29 S. Ct. 567; Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, \n239 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 143, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 927; Reinman v. Little Rock, \n237 \nU.S. 171\n, 35 S. Ct. 511; Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 529\n, 530 S., 37 S. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, App. Cas. 1917C, 594.\n Here, however, the exclusion is in general terms of all industrial establishments, and it may thereby happen that not only offensive or dangerous industries will be excluded, but those which are neither offensive nor dangerous will share the same fate. But this is no more than happens in respect of many practice-forbidding laws which this court has upheld, although drawn in general terms so as to include individual cases that may turn out to be innocuous in themselves. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S. Ct. 125; Pierce Oil Corp. v. City of Hope, \n248 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 39 S. Ct. 172. The inclusion of a reasonable margin, to insure effective enforcement, will not put upon a law, otherwise \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 389]\n\u00a0\n valid, the stamp of invalidity. Such laws may also find their justification in the fact that, in some fields, the bad fades into the good by such insensible degrees that the two are not capable of being readily distinguished and separated in terms of legislation. In the light of these considerations, we are not prepared to say that the end in view was not sufficient to justify the general rule of the ordinance, although some industries of an innocent character might fall within the proscribed class. It cannot be said that the ordinance in this respect 'passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat.' Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 44, 47 (57 L. Ed. 184). Moreover, the restrictive provisions of the ordinance in this particular may be sustained upon the principles applicable to the broader exclusion from residential districts of all business and trade structures, presently to be discussed.\n It is said that the village of Euclid is a mere suburb of the city of Cleveland; that the industrial development of that city has now reached and in some degree extended into the village, and in the obvious course of things will soon absorb the entire area for industrial enterprises; that the effect of the ordinance is to divert this natural development elsewhere, with the consequent loss of increased values to the owners of the lands within the village borders. But the village, though physically a suburb of Cleveland, is politically a separate municipality, with powers of its own and authority to govern itself as it sees fit, within the limits of the organic law of its creation and the state and federal Constitutions. Its governing authorities, presumably representing a majority of its inhabitants and voicing their will, have determined, not that industrial development shall cease at its boundaries, but that the course of such development shall proceed within definitely fixed lines. If it be a proper exercise of the police power to relegate industrial establishments to local- \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 390]\n\u00a0\n ities separated from residential sections, it is not easy to find a sufficient reason for denying the power because the effect of its exercise is to divert an industrial flow from the course which it would follow, to the injury of the residential public, if left alone, to another course where such injury will be obviated. It is not meant by this, however, to exclude the possibility of cases where the general public interest would so far outweigh the interest of the municipality that the municipality would not be allowed to stand in the way.\n We find no difficulty in sustaining restrictions of the kind thus far reviewed. The serious question in the case arises over the provisions of the ordinance excluding from residential districts apartment houses, business houses, retail stores and shops, and other like establishments. This question involves the validity of what is really the crux of the more recent zoning legislation, namely, the creation and maintenance of residential districts, from which business and trade of every sort, including hotels and apartment houses, are excluded. Upon that question this court has not thus far spoken. The decisions of the state courts are numerous and conflicting; but those which broadly sustain the power greatly outnumber those which deny it altogether or narrowly limit it, and it is very apparent that there is a constantly increasing tendency in the direction of the broader view. We shall not attempt to review these decisions at length, but content ourselves with citing a few as illustrative of all.\n As sustaining a broader view, see Opinion of the Justices, 234 Mass. 597, 607, 127 N. E. 525; Inspector of Buildings of Lowell v. Stoklosa, 250 Mass. 52, 145 N. E. 262; Spector v. Building Inspector of Milton, 250 Mass. 63, 145 N. E. 265; Brett v. Building Commissioner of Brookline, 250 Mass. 73, 145 N. E. 269; State v. City of New Orleans, 154 La. 271, 282, 97 So. 440, 33 A. L. R. 260; Lincoln Trust Co. v. Williams Bldg. Corp., 229 N. Y. 313, 128 N. E. 209; City of Aurora v. Burns, 319 Ill. 84, 93, 149 N. E. 784; Deynzer v. City of Evanston, 319 Ill. 226, 149 N E. 790; \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 391]\n\u00a0\n State ex rel. v. Houghton, 164 Minn. 146, 204 N. W. 569; State ex rel. Carter v. Harper, 182 Wis. 148, 157-161, 196 N. W. 451, 33 A. L. R. 269; Ware v. City of Wichita, 113 Kan. 153, 214 P. 99; Miller v. Board of Public Works, 195 Cal. 477, 486-495, 234 P. 381, 38 A. L. R. 1479; City of Providence v. Stephens (R. I.) 133 A. 614.\n For the contrary view, see Goldman v. Crowther, 147 Md. 282, 128 A. 50, 38 A. L. R. 1455; Ignaciunas v. Risley, 98 N. J. Law. 712, 121 A. 783; Spann v. City of Dallas, 111 Tex. 350, 238 S. W. 513, 19 A. L. R. 1387\n\n\n As evidence of the decided trend toward the broader view, it is significant that in sime instances the state courts in later decisions have reversed their former decisions holding the other way. For example, compare State ex rel. v. Houghton, supra, sustaining the power, with State ex rel. Lachtman v. Houghton, 134 Minn. 226, 158 N. W. 1917, L. R. A. 1917F, 1050, State ex rel. Roerig v. City of Minneapolis, 136 Minn. 479, 162 N. W. 477, and Vorlander v. Hokenson, 145 Minn. 484, 175 N. W. 995, denying it, all of which are disapproved in the Houghton Case (page 151 ( 204 N. W. 569)) last decided.\n The decisions enumerated in the first group cited above agree that the exclusion of buildings devoted to business, trade, etc., from residential districts, bears a rational relation to the health and safety of the community. Some of the grounds for this conclusion are promotion of the health and security from injury of children and others by separating dwelling houses from territory devoted to trade and industry; suppression and prevention of disorder; facilitating the extinguishment of fires, and the enforcement of street traffic regulations and other general welfare ordinances; aiding the health and safety of the community, by excluding from residential areas the confusion and danger of fire, contagion, and disorder, which in greater or less degree attach to the location of stores, shops, and factories. Another ground is that the construction and repair of streets may be rendered easier and less expensive, by confining the greater part of the heavy traffic to the streets where business is carried on. \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 392]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Illinois, in City of Aurora v. Burns, supra, pages 93-95 (149 N. E. 788), in sustaining a comprehensive building zone ordinance dividing the city into eight districts, including exclusive residential districts for one and two family dwellings, churches, educational institutions, and schools, said:\n'The constantly increasing density of our urban populations, the multiplying forms of industry and the growing complexity of our civilization make it necessary for the state, either directly or through some public agency by its sanction, to limit individual activities to a greater extent than formerly. With the growth and development of the state the police power necessarily develops, within reasonable bounds, to meet the changing conditions. ...\n\n'... The harmless may sometimes be brought within the regulation or prohibition in order to abate or destroy the harmful. The segregation of industries, commercial pursuits, and dwellings to particular districts in a city, when exercised reasonably, may bear a rational relation to the health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the community. The establishment of such districts or zones may, among other things, prevent congestion of population, secure quiet residence districts, expedite local transportation, and facilitate the suppression of disorder, the extinguishment of fires, and the enforcement of traffic and sanitary regulations. The danger of fire and the of contagion are often lessened by the exclusion of stores and factories from areas devoted to residences, and, in consequence, the safety and health of the community may be promoted. ...\n\n'... The exclusion of places of business from residential districts is not a declaration that such places are nuisances or that they are to be suppressed as such, but it is a part of the general plan by which the city's territory is allotted to different uses, in order to prevent, or at least to reduce, the congestion, disorder, and dangers \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 393]\n\u00a0\n which often inhere in unregulated municipal development.'\n\n The Supreme Court of Louisiana, in State v. City of New Orleans, supra, pages 282, 283 (97 So. 444), said:\n'In the first place, the exclusion of business establishments from residence districts might enable the municipal government to give better police protection. Patrolmen's beats are larger, and therefore fewer, in residence neighborhoods than in business neighborhoods. A place of business in a residence neighborhood furnishes an excuse for any criminal to go into the neighborhood, where, otherwise, a stranger would be under the ban of suspicion. Besides, open shops invite loiterers and idlers to congregate; and the places of such congregations need police protection. In the second place, the zoning of a city into residence districts and commercial districts is a matter of economy is street paving. Heavy trucks, hauling freight to and from places of business in residence districts, require the city to maintain the same costly pavement in such districts that is required for business districts; whereas, in the residence districts, where business establishments are excluded, a cheaper pavement serves the purpose. ...\n\n'Aside from considerations of economic administration, in the matter of police and fire protection, street paving, etc., any business establishment is likely to be a genuine nuisance in a neighborhood of residences. Places of business are noisy; they are apt to be disturbing at night; some of them are malodorous; some are unsightly; some are apt to breed rats, mice, roaches, flies, ants, etc. ...\n\n'If the municipal council deemed any of the reasons which have been suggested, or any other substantial reason, a sufficient reason for adopting the ordinance in question, it is not the province of the courts to take issue with the council. We have nothing to do with the question of the wisdom or good policy of municipal ordinances. If they are not satisfying to a majority of the citizens, their recourse is to the ballot-not the courts.' \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 394]\n\u00a0\n The matter of zoning has received much attention at the hands of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations have been set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports which bear every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view that the segregation of residential, business and industrial buildings will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase the safety and security of home life, greatly tend to prevent street accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting confusion in residential sections, decrease noise and other conditions which produce or intensify nervous disorders, preserve a more favorable environment in which to rear children, etc. With particular reference to apartment houses, it is pointed out that the development of detached house sections is greatly retarded by the coming of apartment houses, which has sometimes resulted in destroying the entire section for private house purposes; that in such sections very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities-until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these circum- \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 395]\n\u00a0\n stances, apartment houses, which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable, come very near to being nuisances.\n\n If these reasons, thus summarized, do not demonstrate the wisdom or sound policy in all respects of those restrictions which we have indicated as pertinent to the inquiry, at least, the reasons are sufficiently cogent to preclude us from saying, as it must be said before the ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, that such provisions are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, supra, pages 530-531 (37 S. Ct. 190); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 U.S. 11\n, 30-31, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765.\n It is true that when, if ever, the provisions set forth in the ordinance in tedious and minute detail, come to be concretely applied to particular premises, including those of the appellee, or to particular conditions, or to be considered in connection with specific complaints, some of them, or even many of them, may be found to be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. But where the equitable remedy of injunction is sought, as it is here, not upon the ground of a present infringement or denial of a specific right, or of a particular injury in process of actual execution, but upon the broad ground that the mere existence and threatened enforcement of the ordinance, by materially and adversely affecting values and curtailing the opportunities of the market, constitute a present and irreparable injury, the court will not scrutinize its provisions, sentence by sentence, to ascertain by a process of piecemeal dissection whether there may be, here and there, provisions of a minor character, or relating to matters of administration, or not shown to contribute to the injury complained of, which, if attacked separately, might not withstand the test of constitutionality. In respect of such provisions, of which specific complaint is not \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 396]\n\u00a0\n made, it cannot be said that the landowner has suffered or is threatened with an injury which entitles him to challenge their constitutionality. Turpin v. Lemon, \n187 \nU.S. 51, 60\n, 23 S. Ct. 20. In Railroad Commission Cases, \n116 U.S. 307\n, 335-337, 6 S. Ct. 334, 388, 1191, this court dealt with an analogous situation. There an act of the Mississippi Legislature, regulating freight and passenger rates on intrastate railroads and creating a supervisory commission, was attacked as unconstitutional. The suit was brought to enjoin the commission from enforcing against the plaintiff railroad company any of its provisions. In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Waite, this court held that the chief purpose of the statute was to fix a maximum of charges and to regulate in some matters of a police nature the use of railroads in the state. After sustaining the constitutionality of the statute 'in its general scope' this court said:\n'Whether in some of its details the statute may be defective or invalid we do not deem it necessary to inquire, for this suit is brought to prevent the commissioners from giving it any effect whatever as against this company.'\n\n Quoting with approval from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississppi, it was further said:\n'Many questions may arise under it not necessary to be disposed of now, and we leave them for consideration when presented.'\n\n And finally:\n'When the commission has acted and proceedings are had to enforce what it has done, questions may arise as to the validity of some of the various provisions which will be worthy of consideration, but we are unable to say that, as a whole, the statute is invalid.'\n\n The relief sought here is of the same character, namely, an injunction against the enforcement of any of the restrictions, limitations, or conditions of the ordinance. And the gravamen of the complaint is that a portion of the land of the appellee cannot be sold for certain enumer- \n\n[272 U.S. 365, 397]\n\u00a0\n ated uses because of the general and broad restraints of the ordinance. What would be the effect of a restraint imposed by one or more or the innumerable provisions of the ordinance, considered apart, upon the value or marketability of the lands, is neither disclosed by the bill nor by the evidence, and we are afforded no basis, apart from mere speculation, upon which to rest a conclusion that it or they would have any appreciable effect upon those matters. Under these circumstances, therefore, it is enough for us to determine, as we do, that the ordinance in its general scope and dominant features, so far as its provisions are here involved, is a valid exercise of authority, leaving other provisions to be dealt with as cases arise directly involving them.\n And this is in accordance with the traditional policy of this court. In the realm of constitutional law, especially, this court has perceived the embarrassment which is likely to result from an attempt to formulate rules or decide questions beyond the necessities of the immediate issue. It has preferred to follow the method of a gradual approach to the general by a systematically guarded application and extension of constitutional principles to particular cases as they arise, rather than by out of hand attempts to establish general rules to which future cases must be fitted. This process applies with peculiar force to the solution of questions arising under the due process clause of the Constitution as applied to the exercise of the flexible powers of police, with which we are here concerned.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court below seemed to think that the frontage of this property on Euclid avenue to a depth of 150 feet came under U-1 district and was available only for single family dwellings. An examination of the ordinance and subsequent amendments, and a comparison of their terms with the maps, shows very clearly, however, that this view was incorrect. Appellee's brief correctly interpreted the ordinance: 'The northerly 500 feet thereof immediately adjacent to the right of way of the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company under the original ordinance was classed as U-6 territory and the rest thereof as U-2 territory. By amendments to the ordinance a strip 630(620) feet wide north of Euclid avenue is classed as U-2 territory, a strip 130 feet wide next north as U- 3 territory and the rest of the parcel to the Nickel Plate right of way as U-6 territory.' \n\n\n\n\n","217":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVIRGINIAN RY. CO. v. MULLENS(1926)\nNo. 163\nArgued: Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. T. Hall, of Roanoke, Va., W. H. T. Loyall, of Norfolk, Va., G. A. Wingfield, of Roanoke, Va., and E. W. Knight, of Charleston, W. Va. (Messrs. M. P. Howard, of Pineville, W. Va., Williams, Loyall & Tunstall, of Norfolk, Va., and Martin & Wingfield, of Roanoke, Va ., of counsel), for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Albert Toler, of Mullens, W. Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action in a state court in West Virginia to recover for injuries to the plaintiff's land resulting from a nuisance alleged to have been created and maintained by the defendant. The action was begun June 14, 1921. The case stated in the complaint was to the effect that the defendant constructed in 1904, and operated up to the time of suit, a railroad through West Virginia, a short section of which was located on a right of way acquired for the purpose and extending laterally into a natural stream bounding the plaintiff's land; that this section was constructed by filling in and building up the outer part of the bed of the stream opposite his land and placing the track on the embankment so made; that the embankment and track narrowed the former channel, crowded the current against the bank on the plaintiff's side and exposed his land to overflow and injury; and that on divers occasions thereafter, particularly in the years 1918 and 1919, this obstruction caused the waters to wash away portions of the bank and to overflow and injure his land.\n The defendant interposed a plea putting in issue the allegations in the complaint, and by a further plea insisted \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n that the road was under federal control from December 28, 1917, to March 1, 1920, and that no liability attached to the defendant for such of the injuries as occurred during that control.\n The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the Supreme Court of Appeals of the state, although petitioned by the defendant to review the judgment, declined so to do, thus making the trial court the highest court of the state in which a decision could be had. American Ry. Express Co. v. Levee, \n263 \nU.S. 19\n, 44 S. Ct. 11. The case is here on writ of certiorari, and the question presented is whether there was error in holding the defendant liable for injuries done during federal control.\n The case shown by the evidence differed from that stated in the complaint. Affirmatively and without dispute the proofs disclosed that the railroad was not constructed by the defendant, but by another railway company, and was purchased by the defendant in 1907, after it was completed and in full operation; that after the purchase the defendant used the embankment and track in the bed of the stream as an integral part of the road, just as it was used before; that the plaintiff, although familiar with the situation, made no complaint of this use or of the presence of the embankment and track in that place; that on December 28, 1917, the United States took possession of the railroad and its appurtenances, and from that time to March 1, 1920, operated and controlled the same to the exclusion of the defendant; that during such operation and control the United States exercised the usual rights of an owner by altering parts of the roadbed, widening tunnels, laying double tracks along parts of the road and using the property as best suited the government's purposes. As respects the section in the bed of the stream the evidence showed that the United States made no change therein, but continued the use theretofore made of it as part of the road; and as respects the \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n injuries done to the plaintiff's land the evidence, taken most favorably to him, disclosed that, while there was some cutting of the bank on his side soon after the road was constructed and also during the defendant's possession and operation, the chief injuries occurred in February, 1918, and July, 1919, during federal control, when in the course of two unusual freshets portions of the bank were washed away and his land was overflowed and materially injured.\n At the conclusion of the evidence the defendant, relying on acts of Congress and proclamations of the President bearing on the federal control, requested the court to charge the jury that the defendant was not liable for the injuries occurring during such control and that as to them the finding and verdict must be for the defendant. But the request was refused and the defendant excepted. If the request was well grounded in law, its refusal was plainly prejudicial.\n While the evidence may have admitted of a finding that the embankment and track in the bed of the stream tended to obstruct and divert the current in such way as to constitute a nuisance, it affirmatively and indubitably precluded a finding that the defendant constructed them or did more than use them as an integral part of a completed road which it had purchased as a going concern from a prior owner. Thus there was no basis no which the defendant could be charged with liability as the creator of the nuisance. If liable at all, it was liable only because it continued the use to which the embankment and track were put by its grantor. There has been much contrariety of decision in the courts of the several states as to whether a purchaser who merely continues a prior use of such a structure may be charged, at the instance of one who has made no complaint or objection, with liability for maintaining a nuisance. The question ordinarily is one of local law to be resolved according to \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n local decisions, and out of deference to the action of the court below we assume that in West Virginia a complaint or objection is not deemed essential, although no decision on the point by the Supreme Court of Appeals has been brought to our attention. But here it was insisted and the proofs conclusively established that the defendant's use ceased when federal control began, and that the chief injuries occurred during the period of that control. The questions of the defendant's legal relation to the road and the operation thereof while under federal control and of its liability for injuries occurring during that period involved a consideration of the nature of that control and of the operation and effect of federal statutes and proclamations bearing on the subject. In short, they are federal questions.\n By the Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 645, Congress empowered the President, in time of war, to take possession and assume control of transportation systems and to utilize the same in the transportation of troops, war material and equipment, and for other needful or desirable purposes incident to such an emergency. War with Germany was declared April 6, 1917, and with Austria-Hungary December 7, 1917, and in both instances Congress pledged all of the resources of the country to bring the conflict to a successful termination. 40 Stat. 1, 429. Under a proclamation declaring his purpose so to do (40 Stat. 1733 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1974a)), the President took possession and assumed control, at noon on December 28, 1917, of various systems of transportation, including the defendant's railroad and the appurtenances thereof, to the end that they might be operated and utilized in transporting troops, war material and equipment, and in performing other service in the national interest; and he committed the possession, control, operation and utilization of such systems to a Director General designated by him for the purpose. By the Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a et seq.), \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n Congress confirmed the President's action in thus taking over the transportation systems, made provision for continuing such federal control under the President's direction, and empowered him to exercise his authority in that regard through agencies of his selection. In General Order No. 50, issued October 28, 1918 (U. S. R. R. Administration Bulletin No. 4, Revised, 334), which recited that suits were being brought against railroad companies, the roads of which were under federal control, on causes of action arising during such control for which the companies were not responsible, it was directed that actions and suits based on claims for injuries to persons, damage to property, etc., growing out of the possession, use, control or operation of any railroad by the Director General be brought against that officer, and not otherwise.\n We heretofore have considered the legislation, proclamation and order just recited and have held that they provided for a complete possession by the United States and contemplated a single and effective control by federal authority to the exclusion of the private owners (Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 135, 148\n, 39 S. Ct. 502); and that during federal control 'no liability arising out of the operation of these systems was imposed by the common law upon the owner companies as their interest in and control over the systems were completely suspended' ( Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 41 S.  Ct. 593, 595 ( 65 L. Ed. 1087)). In the latter case the contention was made that the act of 1918 should be construed as subjecting the companies to liability for acts or omissions of the agency exercising federal control, notwithstanding they were deprived of all power over the properties, because the just compensation to be paid to them would include any loss resulting to them from such liability. But this court disposed of the contention by saying (\n256 \nU.S. 559\n, 41 S. Ct. 595):\n'Such a radical departure from the established concepts of legal liability would at least approach the verge of constitutional power. \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n It should not be made in the absence of compelling language. ... There is none such here.'\n\n And, turning to a provision in the act of 1918 declaring 'carriers while under federal control' liable and suable, the court said (\n256 \nU.S. 559\n, 41 S. Ct. 595):\n'Here the term 'carriers' was used as it is understood in common speech; meaning the transportation systems as distinguished from the corporations owning or operating them.'\n\n And (\n256 \nU.S. 561\n, 41 S. Ct. 596):\n'This means, as a matter of law, that the government or its agency for operation could be sued, for under the existing law the legal person in control of the carrier was responsible for its acts. ... All doubt as to how suit should be brought was cleared away by General Order No. 50, which required that it be against the Director General by name.'\n\n In Wabash Ry. Co. v. Elliott, \n261 \nU.S. 457, 462\n, 43 S. Ct. 406, the decision was to the same effect. In North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Lee, \n260 \nU.S. 16\n, 43 S. Ct. 2, it was held that the government operated the railroads during federal control 'not as lessee, but under a right in the nature of eminent domain'; and in Dupont de Nemours & Co. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 456, 462\n, 44 S. Ct. 364, 366 (68 L. Ed. 788) it was added that:\n'In taking over and operating the railroad systems of the country the United States did so in its sovereign capacity, as a war measure.'\n\n In principle these decisions are determinative of the question here presented. They show that federal control did not rest on a conventional arrangement with the owner companies, but on an exertion of supreme governmental power, and that the legislation, proclamation and order before recited contemplated a complete separation of the companies from the roads while under such control, and an absence of responsibility by the companies for losses and injuries resulting from the use, operation, and maintenance of the roads during that period.\n When the United States took over this road the embankment and track in the bed of the stream were taken over as part of it, and the defendant was deprived of all \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n power over them while they remained under federal control. Their maintenance and use during that period were exclusively in the hands of federal agents. If a duty rested on any one to make any change in them, it rested on the federal agents; and if maintaining and using them without change was a wrong against the plaintiff, it was a wrong committed by those agents, for which no liability attached to the defendant.\n The plaintiff relies on cases holding the creator of a nuisance liable for injuries resulting therefrom after he had transferred the premises to another by need or lease; but they are not in point. They proceed on the theory that by such a transfer the creator expressly or impliedly affirms the right of the transferee to continue the prior situation or use, and also voluntarily disables himself from correcting or abating the same. Here the defendant had neither created the nuisance nor made a voluntary transfer of the premises. The United States, as we have seen, came into possession, not as a conventional transferee, but by an exercise of governmental power in which the defendant had no voice.\n The plaintiff also seeks to support the judgment on the theory that the defendant company was under a contract obligation to protect his land from injury, and to make out that obligation he refers to a clause in the deed whereby the defendant's grantor acquired the right of way and to a clause in the deed whereby the defendant afterwards acquired the completed road. But he is not in a position to urge this contention here. The case stated in the complaint was distinctly in tort. There was no mention of a contract obligation; nor any reference to either of the two deeds. And when the court came to charge the jury the plaintiff tendered and the court included in its charge various instructions wherein the case was treated, in keeping with the complaint, as one to recover damages for an alleged tortious creation and continuance of a nuisance. After bringing and trying the case on that theory the \n\n[271 U.S. 220, 228]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff cannot be permitted on this review to change to another which the defendant was not required to meet below. Other objections to the contract theory are suggested buy they need not be considered.\n We conclude that the court should have instructed the jury, as it was requested to do, that the defendant was not liable for the injuries occurring during federal control.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","218":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVIRGINIAN RY. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 281\nArgued: October 29, 1926Decided: December 13, 1926\n\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 658, 660]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James W. Carmalt, of Washington, D. C., W. H. T. Loyall, of Norfolk, Va., and E. W. Knight, of Charleston, W. Va., for Virginian Ry. Co.\n Messrs. Blackburn Esterline, P. J. Farrell, and Ewing H. Scott, all of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. P. J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An extensive territory in West Virginia, comprising the coal mining districts known as New River, Tug River, and Pocahontas, is served by three railroad systems. Each grants blanket rates to destination from the mines within the district served by it. The blanket rates to each destination are the same on all the systems. Two of them, the Chesapeake & Ohio and the Norfolk & Western, have lines extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Middle West. The line of the third, the Virginian, extends only eastward to tidewater. Some mines in the district are served directly by only one of these railroads; some by more. Nintey-nine mines are located only on the Virginian. Of these 45 enjoy, by reason of the trackage agreements to be described, the same rates to the West as do mines on the Chesapeake & Ohio and on the Norfolk & Western. The remaining 54 are denied the opportunity of reaching the Western markets.\n Some of the 54 made complaint to the Interstate Commerce Commission that they are denied access to the \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 661]\n\u00a0\n Western markets, and sought relief under both section 1 and section 3 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8563, 8565). For most of these 54 mines access to these markets was and is physically possible through a junction of the Virginian and the Chesapeake & Ohio. But that route is closed commercially, because these two carriers have not established any joint rates to the West from any of these 54 mines, and the combination of the Virginian's local rate from the mines to the junction with the Chesapeake & Ohio's rates from the junction to the West results in charges so high as to be prohibitive. The complainants contended before the Commission that the existing rate schedule to the West subjects them to unjust discrimination, and also that the combination rates are unreasonable. To establish the discrimination, the shippers relied, among other things, upon the fact that 45 other mines located only on the Virginian enjoy the favorable blanket rates to the West. To establish the unreasonableness. they showed, among other things, that mines similarly situated, located only on the Chesapeake & Ohio and on the Norfolk & Western, enjoy those rates.\n The Chesapeake & Ohio did not oppose granting to the 54 mines the relief sought. The Virginian resisted strenuously. The complete record of the proceedings before the Commission occupies 713 pages of the printed record in this court, besides 67 exhibits, many of them elaborate, one covering 89 pages. The proceedings before the Commission, begun on May 15, 1922, did not close until February, 1923. The proposed report of the examiner was served on April 30, 1924, was submitted to division 3 of the Commission on June 30, 1924, and its original report was filed on March 10, 1925. The Commission found that the existing rates from the mines in question subjected the shippers to undue prejudice, and also that the rates were themselves unreasonable. Wyoming Coal Co. v. Virginian Railway Co., 96 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 359, and 98 Interst. Com. Com'n R. \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 662]\n\u00a0\n 448. It ordered the carriers, 'according as they participate in the transportation.' to cease and desist from collecting, for the transportation of coal from certain stations on the Virginian Railway to interstate destinations in the West, rates which exceed those to be prescribed pursuant to the order, and then directed the carriers to establish 'rates which shall not exceed the district rates maintained on like traffic' by those carriers respondents to the same destinations 'from mines in the New River districts of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and the Virginian Railway Company, respectively, and the Pocahontas and Tug River districts of the Norfolk & Western Railway Company, those districts forming part of what is generally referred to as the 'Outer Crescent.\" See Bituminous Coal to Central Freight Association Territory, 46 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 66, 69. A petition for reargument before the whole Commission was denied on April 14, 1925; but an amended report and order was filed on May 19, 1925\n\n\n This suit was brought by the Virginian against the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Chesapeake & Ohio, in the federal court for the Southern District of West Virginia, to enjoin the enforcement of the order and to set it aside. All three defendants answered, the Chesapeake & Ohio asserting its readiness to comply with the Commission's order. Several coal companies intervened as defendants. The case was heard, on May 28, 1925, before three judges, upon application for an interlocutory injunction and also upon final hearing. The order was assailed mainly on the ground that the findings made were unsupported by evidence. It was also contended, among other things, that findings essential to the relief granted had not been made. Besides the full transcript of the proceedings before the Commission, the Virginian introduced, under objection, some additional evidence in support of a claim that the order should be set aside because of certain facts occurring since it was \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 663]\n\u00a0\n entered. On September 19, 1925, the court entered a final decree denying the injunction and dismissing the bill on the merits. No. opinion, written or oral, was delivered.\n Before entry of the decree, the Virginian indicated an intention to appeal, and asserted that irreparable damage would result, pending the appeal, if the decree should be reversed. Thereupon the District Court included in the final decree a clause restraining enforcement of the Commission's order pending the perfecting and determination of the appeal. No. 282 is a cross-appeal by the United States and the Commission from so much of the decree as restrains enforcement of the Commission's order pending the appeal. No. 281 is the appeal by the Virginian. under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, from so much of the decree as denied the injunction and dismissed the bill. The contentions made by the Virginian here seem to be the same that were made by it below, and largely the same that it made before the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n First. The Virginian attacks the Commission's finding of unjust discrimination. There clearly was substantial evidence to support every fact specifically found. To consider the weight of the evidence before the Commission, the soundness of the reasoning by which its conclusions were reached, or whether the findings are consistent with those made by it in other cases, is beyond our province. Whether a rate is unjustly discriminatory is a question on which the finding of the Commission, supported by substantial evidence, is conclusive, unless there was some irregularity in the proceeding or some error in the application of rules of law. Western Paper Makers' Chemical Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268\n, 46 S. Ct. 500. No irregularity in the proceedings before the Commission is even suggested.\n Second. The Virginian contends that the specific facts found are, as matter of law, insufficient to support the finding of undue prejudice. The facts material are these: \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 664]\n\u00a0\n Ever since the Virginian was constructed, it has adhered to the policy of providing for the output of mines on its line transportation only to tidewater. This policy is pursued, not only because it is deemed profitable to the company, but also because it enables the Virginian to furnish to shippers the most efficient service at reasonable rates. It has never held itself out as equipped to carry coal to the West, or joint rates to Western markets. The 45 mines on its line which enjoy the blanket rates to the West have them as a natural result of certain trackage agreements entered into by the Virginian with the Chesapeake & Ohio for an entirely different purpose. The purpose was to secure additional east- bound tonnage without wasteful expenditure by paralleling branch lines. To be able to secure the eastbound traffic from certain mines located on independent lines connecting with the Chesapeake & Ohio, the Virginian, having acquired the independent lines, sought the right to use that system's tracks to those mines. As compensation for the trackage rights over the Chesapeake & Ohio, it gave that company the right to use the Virginian's tracks to these 45 mines. The carriers, instead of using these trackage rights by operating over the other's tracks, substituted, solely as a matter of economy and convenience, a reciprocal switching arrangement. As a result, the Virginian hauls west-bound coal from these 45 mines to a junction with the Chesapeake & Ohio; the latter absorbs the switching charges of the Virginian, and these mines enjoy the same rate to the West as do those located on the Chesapeake & Ohio. But the Virginian's purpose in making the traffic agreement was solely to increase its east-bound traffic.\n The fact that the Virginian's intention was not to give the 45 mines a preference over others, but to increase its own east-bound business from mines located on the other system, and that the preference resulting is merely an incident of a legitimate effort to develop the carrier's east- \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 665]\n\u00a0\n bound traffic, is not of legal significance. These 45 mines to which the Western market has been thus opened obviously enjoy thereby an advantage over the 54 mines, found to be similarly situated, to which the market is closed; and the Commission has found that the preference is unjust. In essence, the situation is the same as that considered in United States v. Illinois Central R. R., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 523\n, 44 S. Ct. 189, and United States v. Pennsylvania R. R., \n266 \nU.S. 191, 199\n, 45 S. Ct. 43. The contention that there can be no order to remove the discrimination, because the Virginian is in no legal sense responsible for the lower Western rates granted to the favored mines, is likewise disposed of by the earlier case, at pages 520, 521 (44 S. Ct. 189).\n Third. The Virginian contends that the evidence before the Commission does not support its finding that the rates on coal from the Virginian's mines via the Chesapeake & Ohio are unreasonable to the extent that they exceed the New River district rates maintained by the latter carrier from mines on its own and connecting lines having no other outlet to the Western markets. The argument is that these rates cannot be considered standards of reasonableness, because, as the Commission declared in the present controversy, they are 'the outcome of competitive strain and stress through long periods of development,' and, as it had stated in an earlier case, they have been made 'in practical, if not absolute, disregard of distance, and all transportation conditions that ordinarily are taken into consideration in the making of rates,' and 'are below the level at which maximum reasonable rates might be maintained.' Bituminous Coal to C. F. A. Territory, 46 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 66, 122, 145. The finding of reasonableness, like that of undue prejudice, is a determination of a fact by a tribunal 'informed by experience.' Illinois Central R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 206, U. S. 441, 454, 27 S. Ct. 700. This court has no concern with the correctness of the \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 666]\n\u00a0\n Commission's reasoning, with the soundness of its conclusions, or with the alleged inconsistency with findings made in other proceedings before it. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541\n, 32 S. Ct. 108. It was shown that a huge coal traffic moves from this territory, under like operating conditions, at the blanket rates which were voluntarily established by the other carriers to serve mines similarly located. This fact, and much else in the voluminous record, afford substantive evidence to support the finding that the existing rates are unreasonable, and that those which the order directs are reasonable.\n Fourth. The Virginian contends that the order is void because the Commission directed rected the establishment of through routes and joint rates without finding that they are necessary in the public interest. Such a finding is essential to the validity of an order under section 15(3), being Comp. St.  8583. But the order here in question was not sought or made under section 15(3), and does not direct the establishment of through routes and joint rates. Through routes to the West were already in existence; and there were through rates by combination. See Through Routes and Through Rates, 12 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 163; Memphis Freight Bureau v. Ft. Smith & W. R. R. Co., 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 1, 8; Baer Bros. M. Co. v. Mo. Pac. Ry. Co., 17 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 225: Swift & Co. v. Pa. R. R. Co., 29 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 464; Lourie Mfg. Co. v. Cincinnati N. R. R. Co., 42 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 448; Kansas City Bd. of Trade v. A., T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 69 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 185, 188, 189; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 139\n, 38 S. Ct. 49, note 2. The fact that the combination rates were excessive constituted the only obstacle to the movement. The Chesapeake & Ohio did not oppose the reduction of its rates from the junction to the West. It ws willing that these 54 mines on the Virginian should enjoy the rates already open to the other 45. The Virginian resisted a reduction of its local rate to the \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 667]\n\u00a0\n junction. The Commission found that the combination rate was both unreasonable and discriminatory. It prescribed through rates which it found were reasonable and nondiscriminatory. It did not order joint rates. And no question of divisions was before the Commission. The order ws sought and made under section 1 and section 3. Section 15(3) does not require that the Commission must make a special finding of public interest, before it can prescribe how an existing through rate found to be unreasonable and discriminatory shall be made conformable to law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. The Virginian contends that the order should be set aside because of the following facts, which occurred after entry of the original order and before the hearing below: An agreement to lease the Virginian to the Norfolk & Western for 999 years was approved by the respec- \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 668]\n\u00a0\n tive boards of directors of the two companies, approval by the stockholders was expected, and approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission was hoped for. In anticipation of such approval, the Virginian and the Norfolk & Western established and published through routes and joint rates, from substantially all mines on the Virginian to substantially all important markets in the West. The virginian then filed, on April 27, 1925, a petition before the Commission to reopen the case and modify its order, so that the routes which had been opened via the Norfolk & Western in partial compliance with the order should be accepted as the equivalent of full compliance, and the requirement of routes and rates via the Chesapeake & Ohio should be eliminated. That petition was denied on May 11, 1925. The Virginian contends that, in view of these facts, the order requiring transportation service also via the Chesapeake & Ohio is so unreasonable as to transcend the limits of the Commission's discretion, among other reasons because, through the duplication of routes not available to mines served only by the Chesapeake & Ohio and the Norfolk & Western, respectively, it would give to mines on the Virginian an undue preference and advantage. The argument urged in this connection is appropriate for consideration by the Commission, and has presumably been duly considered by it. The fact that it has not proved persuasive affords no basis for the contention that the Commission's action in making the order was arbitrary or otherwise illegal. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Sixth. The cross-appeal is directed to so much of the final decree as stays enforcement of the Commission's order pending the appeal. It is settled that the force and effect of a decree of a federal court dismissing a bill and dissolving an interlocutory injunction is not suspended \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 669]\n\u00a0\n as a mere consequence of an appeal to this court, even if a supersedeas is allowed. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 3 S. Ct. 136: Knox County v. Harshman, \n132 \nU.S. 14\n, 10 S. Ct. 8. An injunction which was in terms dissolved by the decree, or which expired by limitation, cannot be revived to take effect during the pendency of an appeal except by a new exercise of power by a court having the authority. Ordinarily such authority is vested in the lower federal court, as well as in this court. Under equity rule 74 the judge who allows the appeal may, if he took part in the decision of the cause, make, at the time of such allowance, an order continuing an interlocutory injunction which would otherwise be vacated. Merrimack River Savings Bank v. Clay Center, \n219 \nU.S. 527, 535\n, 31 S. Ct. 295, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 513. Prior to the establishment of the Commerce Court, by Act June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, the Circuit Courts had jurisdiction of suits to enjoin or set aside orders of the Commission. Compare Act June 26, 1906, c. 3591,  5, 34 Stat. 584, 590 (Comp. St.  8584). As an incident of that jurisdiction, they had the usual power to preserve the status quo pending an appeal. The government contends that the rule theretofore prevailing was abrogated by the act of 1910, and that, because of similar provision in the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, the power in question was not conferred upon the District Courts.\n The latter act, which abolished the Commerce Court and transferred to the District Courts the jurisdiction in this class of cases, requires that applications for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Commission be heard before three judges; permits the issue by them, or a majority of them, of 'a temporary stay or suspension' of the Commission's order for not more than 60 days pending the application for an interlocutory injunction; similarly permits them 'at the time of hearing such application (to) continue the temporary stay or suspension ... until decision \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 670]\n\u00a0\n upon the application'; provides for expediting the hearing; and authorizes a direct appeal to this court from the order granting or denying the interlocutory injunction, if taken within 30 days. Compare United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 306, 322\n, 32 S. Ct. 817. The argument of the government is that the thing of which the operation is suspended, pending the appeal, is not the decree of the District Court, but the order of the Commission, an independent federal tribunal; that, by the language of the act, the power of the District Court to suspend the operation of the Commission's order ends with the 'decision (in the District Court) upon the application'; and that for these reasons, the customary power of a court of equity to preserve the status quo is not applicable to the suspension pending the appeal here involved.\n It is clear that this court, or a justice thereof, has power to grant a stay of the Commission's order pending the appeal. The power was exercised by the full court in Omaha & Council Bluffs R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n222 \nU.S. 582\n, 32 S. Ct. 833, in a case coming from the Commerce Court under the act of 1910. Whether the district court of three judges under the act of 1913 possesses like power has never been considered by this court. The existence of the power was affirmed by a divided District Court in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. United States, 227 F. 273, and the power was exercised to the extent of staying enforcement of the Commission's order until this court should have the opportunity of determining whether a stay pending the appeal should be granted. The power has been exercised by the District Court in a few other instances. But in those cases, although the government objected to the action taken, it did not take a cross-appeal; and the question was not considered or raised upon the argument before \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 671]\n\u00a0\n this court. \n3\n The question now presented was, however, passed upon under similar legislation and conditions in Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 212\n, 43 S. Ct. 75. The practice there held appropriate in a proceeding under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243) must be held to be likewise authorized under the act of 1913.\n Section 266 provides for the hearing before three judges of applications for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the execution of a state statute, or of an order of an administrative board of the state pursuant to a state statute, where the statute or order is assailed on the ground that it violates the federal Constitution. We declared in the Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. Case, page 219 (43 S. Ct. 77) that, while this court has power to grant a stay pending the appeal, the District Court acting through three judges, or a majority of them, also possesses that power, and that because such court is 'best and most conveniently able to exercise the nice discretion needed, ... the court of three judges, who have heard the whole matter, have read the record, and can pass on the issue (application for a suspension pending the appeal) without additional labor,' the determination of the application will ordinarily be left to it. The language of section 266 which limits the \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 672]\n\u00a0\n power to grant the restraining order and the interlocutory injunction is substantially the same as that employed in the Act of October 22, 1913. The two statutes are in pari materia. It is under section 266 that proceedings to enjoin the enforcement of rate orders of state Railroad and Public Utility Commissions are commonly instituted.\n The character of the proceeding and the end sought are the same in the two statutes. The two provisions originated in the same act. Section 266 is a codification of section 17 of the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 557. The provision of the act of 1913, here in question, is an adaptation to the District Courts of section 3 of the act of 1910 (Comp. St.  997), which prescribed the procedure for such applications before the Commerce Court. No reason is suggested why the rule governing in cases of appeals from the District Court under section 266 should not apply also to appeals from those courts under the act of 1913. Moreover, the latter act, in referring in the same connection to appeals from final decrees, declares that 'such appeals may be taken in like manner as appeals are taken under existing law in equity cases.' Congress evidently deemed that it had adequately guarded against the dangers incident to the improvident issue of the writs of injunction in cases of this character by the provisions which require action by the court of three judges, which permit of expediting the hearings before the District Court, which shorten the period of appeal, and which give a direct appeal to this court.\n Seventh. The Government contends that, even if the District Court had power to say the order of the Commission pending the appeal in this court, its action was not warranted by the facts. A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant. In re Haberman Manufacturing Co., \n147 \nU.S. 525\n, 13 S. Ct. 527. It is an exercise of judicial discretion. The propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 673]\n\u00a0\n of the particular case. An application to suspend the operation of the Commission's order pending an appeal from a final decree dismissing the bill on the merits calls for the exercise of discretion under circumstances essentially different from those which obtain when the application for a stay is made prior to a hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction, or after the hearing thereon but before the decision. In the two latter classes of cases, if the bill seems to present to the court a serious question, the fact that irreparable injury may otherwise result to the plaintiff may, as an exercise of discretion, alone justify granting the temporary stay until there is an opportunity for adequate consideration of the matters involved. But to justify a stay pending an appeal from a final decree refusing an injunction additional facts must be shown. For the decree creates a strong presumption of its own correctness and of the validity of the Commission's order. This presumption ordinarily entitles defendant carriers and the public to the benefits which the order was intended to secure.\n In this class of cases an appeal bond can rarely indemnity fully even private parties to the litigation for the loss of the benefits of which the stay deprived them, and the public would usually be left wholly remediless. To justify granting the stay after a final decree sustaining the Commission's order, it must appear either that the District Court entertains a serious doubt as to the correctness of its own decision, or that the decision depends upon a question of law on which there is conflict among the courts of the several circuits, or that some other special reason exists why the order of the Commission ought not to become operative until its validity can be considered by this court. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 658, 674]\n\u00a0\n The District Court made no finding or statement bearing upon its exercise of discretion in suspending the operation of the Commission's order, except the recital in the decree that from all the evidence in the case it is 'of opinion ... that irreparable damage will result to the complainant pending such appeal if this decree shall be reversed on appeal.' We must therefore look elsewhere in the record for additional facts necessary to justify the suspension. We fail to find any. The suit was of a character deemed by Congress of such importance that it had made special provision for both adequate and speedy consideration. The strenuousness of the contest and the extensive record made clear the importance of the case not only to the mines and carriers directly concerned but also to the consuming public in the western markets. It was clear that the appeal bond could not indemnify the Virginian mines or the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad for the loss resulting from a stay, and also that the public might suffer losses for which there would be no remedy. The decree was not entered until nearly four months after the hearing-that period being doubtless required for adequate consideration of the voluminous record. No opinion, written or oral, was delivered. In view of the importance of the litigation, we interpret the absence of an opinion as tantamount to a declaration that upon careful scrutiny of the record the questions presented for judicial determination appeared to be simple, or, at all events, that the case did not involve the determination of any question of law which was novel or as to which there was, or could be, reasonable doubt. The decree of the District Court was not unanimous; but this fact alone would not justify a stay. For aught that appears, the District Court may \n\n[272 U.S. 658, 675]\n\u00a0\n have divided on some questions of fact, or on the construction of a document. \n5\n Under the circumstances appearing, the suspension of the order pending the appeal was unwarranted. The objection to the decree asserted by the government in No. 282 must therefore be sustained.\n Unless an opinion indicating the grounds of the decision is delivered, a defeated party may often be unable to determine whether the case presents a question worthy of consideration by the appellate court. This is particularly true, where the case is in equity and the decree is entered upon a hearing involving complicated facts; for, being in equity, matters of fact as well as of law are reviewable, and the reviewable issues of law are rarely sharply defined by request for rulings. The failure to accompany the decree by an opinion may thus deprive litigants of the means of exercising a sound judgment on the propriety of an appeal; and the appellate court, being without knowledge of the grounds of the decision below, is denied an important aid in the consideration of the case, and will ordinarily be subjected to much unnecessary labor. \n No. 281\n-Decree affirmed as to matter appealed from.\n No. 282-Decree reversed as to matter appealed from. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Thus in many cases, as in the case at bar, the Commission has found a combination through rate unreasonable or discriminatory as an entirety, and has ordered it to not higher than a specific amount, without any finding of public interest.

DOUGHTON(1926)\nNo. 49\nArgued: May 6, 1926Decided: November 29, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 567, 568]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. M. Hendren, of Winston-Salem, N. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 567, 570]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dennis G. Brummitt, of Oxford, N. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[272 U.S. 567, 571]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Stanford L. Haynes, of Springfield, Mass., died May 21, 1920, leaving a will which was duly probated at that place. The fifth clause gave to the Springfield Safe Deposit & Trust Company, Massachusetts corporation, the residue of the estate in trust, one-half to be set aside and the net income paid to his daughter, Theodosia, so long as she should live, and at her death to be transferred \n\n[272 U.S. 567, 572]\n\u00a0\n to 'such person or persons and in such proportions as said Theodosia shall by will appoint, or in the event that said Theodosia shall fail to exercise the power of appointment hereby conferred upon her and shall leave issue surviving her, such payment and transfer shall be made to such issue by right of representation.' The corporation accepted the trust and received a large fund.\n After her father's death Theodosia intermarried with Taylor and resided at Morgantown, N. C. She died there June 23, 1921, leaving an infant child. By will dated March 18, 1921, executed in North Carolina and adequate under the laws of the state and of Massachusetts, she directed that the property described by the fifth clause of her father's will should be divided between her husband and child. She also disposed of some land and personal property in North Carilina. The will was duly probated in the latter state and plaintiff in error became administrator of the estate. The fund held by the trust company and subject to appointment was made up of stocks and bonds valued at $395,279.93.\n Section 6, c. 34, Public Laws N. C. 1921, ratified March 8, 1921, directs that all real and personal property passing by will or the intestate laws of the state shall be subject to a tax, and-\n'Whenever any person or corporation shall exercise a power of appointment derived from any disposition of property made either before or after the passage of this act, such appointment when made shall be deemed a transfer taxable under the provisions of this act, in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power and had been bequeathed or devised by such donee by will, and the rate shall be determined by the relationship between the beneficiary under the power and the donor; and whenever any person or corporation possessing such power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time \n\n[272 U.S. 567, 573]\n\u00a0\n provided therefor, in whole or in part, a transfer taxable under the provisions of this act shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omission or failure in the same manner as though the persons or corporations thereby becoming entitled to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which such power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission or failure.'\n\n Acting under this statute, the proper officer demanded payment of a tax computed upon the value of the property which passed under the appointment by Mrs. Taylor. The Supreme Court of North Carolina approved the demand and specifically held that enforcement would not offend the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving the interested parties of property without due process of law. It declared that the statute taxed the exercise of the power of appointment made by permission and under direct protection of local laws. 189 N. C. 50, 126 S. E. 176.\n In Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278\n, 22 S. Ct. 213, and Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 550, this court held that by an act passed subsequent to the instrument which created a power of appointment New York might tax its execution without violating the Fourteenth Amendment. But in each of these causes the first testator, or creator of the trust, and the trustees thereunder were residents of New York and the fund was there held. Here the original testator resided in Massachusetts, his will was probated there, and the trustee holds the funds there for disposition under the local laws. The power of appointment was exercised by a resident of North Carolina by a will there executed and that state has attempted to impose the tax. These circumstances differentiate the causes.\n In Chanler v. Kelsey the statute, chapter 284, Laws N. Y. 1897, provided:\n'Whenever any person or corporation shall exercise the power of appointment derived from any \n\n[272 U.S. 567, 574]\n\u00a0\n disposition of property made either before or after the passage of this act, such appointment when made shall be deemed a transfer taxable under the provisions of this act in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power and had been bequeathed or devised by such donee by will; and whenever any person or corporation possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part, a transfer taxable under the provisions of this act shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omissions or failure, in the same manner as though the persons or corporations thereby becoming entitled to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which such power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission or failure.'\n\n Mrs. Delano, acting under the power granted by her father, appointed by her will those who should take the full beneficial interest in property held by trustees in New York and actually located there. The New York court held that the tax was upon the exercise of the power by will as an effective transfer within the purposes of the act, and this court said:\n'The Court of Appeals of New York had the exclusive right to construe instruments of title in that state, and determine for itself the creation and vesting of estates through wills under the laws of the state.' 'That power was exercised under the will of Laura Delano, a right which was conferred upon her under the laws of the state of New York and for the exercise of which the statute was competent to impose the tax in the exercise of the sovereign power of the Legislature over the right to make a disposition of property by will.'\n\n Except perhaps where the instrument which created the power provides that the appointment must be by will \n\n[272 U.S. 567, 575]\n\u00a0\n executed according to the law of the donee's domicile, to be proved and allowed there, the following propositions are established in Massachusetts:\n'Personal property over which one has the power of appointment is not the property of the donee, but of the donor of the power.' The appointee takes, not as the legatee of him who appoints, but of the original donor. 'Property in the hands of domestic trustees appointed under the will of a domestic testator, who conferred a power of appointment upon a non-resident, must be distributed according to the law of this Commonwealth and ... the execution of the power must be interpreted according to our law and in conformity to the power conferred.'

E. 889.\n\n These principles are commonly accepted. Blount v. Walker, \n134 \nU.S. 607\n, 10 S. Ct. 606; United States v. Field, \n255 \nU.S. 257, 264\n, 41 S. Ct. 256, 18 A. L. R. 1461; Murphy v.

R. 735.\n We think the assets of the trust estate established by the will of Haynes had no situs, actual or constructive, in North Carolina. The exercise of the power of appointment was subject to the laws of Massachusetts and nothing relative thereto was done by permission of the state where Mrs. Taylor happened to have her domicile. No right exercised by the donee was conferred on her by North Carolina. A state may not subject to taxation things wholly beyond her jurisdiction or control Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316.\n The judgment below must be reversed. \n\n[272 U.S. 567, 576]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n In Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S. Ct. 473, where a fund was given in trust for the donor's widow and children, reserving to the donor a general power of revocation and the disposition of the income during his life, it was held that upon his death an inheritance tax could be levied in Wisconsin, the place of his domicile, although the trustee and trust fund were outside of the jurisdiction. The general power was considered to have the same effect as ownership. In this case the power was not so broad, because it was to be executed only by will; but the command over the fund was substantially the same. Mrs. Taylor, the donee, had the life interest and the power to dispose of the remainder by a will which she could bind herself to make. I dare say that it may be desirable to limit the universitas as was done in Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L.

McGuire, of New London, Conn., for appellee.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 402, 408]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee is a Connecticut corporation, and for more than 50 years it and its founders have manufactured comfortables in that state, and have sold them there and in other states. An act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, approved June 14, 1923 (P. L. 802 (Pa. St. Supp. 1924, s 14631a1 et seq.)) regulates the manufacture, sterilization, and sale of bedding. Section 1 of the act prescribes the following definitions:\n'Mattress' means 'any quilted pad, mattress, mattress pad, mattress protector, bunk quilt or box spring, stuffed or filled with excelsior, straw, hay, grass, corn husks, moss, fibre, cotton, wool, \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 409]\n\u00a0\n hair, jute, kapok, or other soft material.' 'Pillow,' 'bolster,' or 'feather bed' means 'any bag, case, or covering made of cotton or other textile material, and stuffed or filled with' any filler mentioned in the definition of 'mattress,' or with feathers or feather down. The word 'comfortable' means 'any cover, quilt, or quilted article made of cotton or other textile material, and stuffed or filled with fibre, cotton, wool, hair, jute, feathers, feather down, kapok, or other soft material.' 'Cushion' means 'any bag or case made of leather, cotton, or other textile material, and stuffed or filled with' any filler, except jute and straw, mentioned in the definition of 'pillow,' or with tow. The word 'new,' as used in the act, means 'any material or article which has not been previously manufactured or used for any purpose. 'Secondhand' means 'any material or article of which prior use has been made.' 'Shoddy' means 'any material which has been spun into yarn, knit or woven into fabric, and subsequently cut up, torn up, broken up, or ground up.'\n\n Section 2 provides:\n'No person shall employ or use in the making, remaking, or renovating of any mattress, pillow, bolster, feather bed, comfortable, cushion, or article of upholstered furniture: (a) Any material known as 'shoddy,' or any fabric or material from which 'shoddy' is constructed; (b) any secondhand material, unless, since last used, such secondhand material has been thoroughly sterilized and disinfected by a reasonable process approved by the commissioner of labor and industry; (c) any new or secondhand feathers, unless such new or secondhand feathers have been sterilized and disinfected by a reasonable process approved by the commissioner of labor and industry.'\n\n Punishment by fine or imprisonment is prescribed for every violation of the act, and each sale is declared to be a separate offense.\n The act took effect January 1, 1924. Appellant is charged with its enforcement, and threatened to proceed \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 410]\n\u00a0\n against the appellee and its customers. January 29, 1924, appellee brought this suit to enjoin the enforcement of the act on the grounds, among others, that, as applied to the business of appellee, it is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. An application under section 266 of the Judicial Code for a temporary injunction was denied. The decree was affirmed by this court. 45 S. Ct. 128, \n266 U.S. 588\n. Later defendant answered, and there was a trial at which much evidence was introduced. The District Court found that the statute infringes appellee's constitutional rights in so far as it absolutely prohibits the use of shoddy in the manufacture of comfortables; and to that extent the decree restrains its enforcement. This appeal is under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 1215).\n The question for decision is whether the provision purporting absolutely to forbid the use of shoddy in comfortables violates the due process clause or the equal protection clause. The answer depends on the facts of the case. Legislative determinations express or implied are entitled to great weight; but it is always open to interested parties to show that the Legislature has transgressed the limits of its power. Penna Coal Co. v. Mahon, 43 S. Ct. 158, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 413\n, 28 S. A. L. R. 1321. Invalidity may be shown by things which will be judicially noticed (Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 32 S. Ct. 192, \n223 U.S. 59\n, 64) or by facts established by evidence. The burden is on the attacking party to establish the invalidating facts. See Minnesota Rate Cases, 33 S. Ct. 729, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 452\n, 48 S. L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n For many years prior to the passage of the act comfortables made in appellee's factories had been sold in Pennsylvania. In 1923 its business in that state exceeded $558,000, of which more than $188,000 was for comfortables filled with shoddy. About 5,000 dozens of these were filled with shoddy made of new materials, and about 3,000 dozens with secondhand shoddy. Appellee \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 411]\n\u00a0\n makes approximately 3,000,000 comfortables annually, and about 750,000 of these are filled with materials defined by the act as shoddy. New material from which appellee makes shoddy consists of clippings and pieces of new cloth obtained from cutting tables in garment factories; secondhand shoddy is made of secondhand garments, rags, and the like. The record shows that annually many million pounds of fabric, new and secondhand, are made into shoddy. It is used for many purposes. It is rewoven into fabric, made into pads to be used as filling material for bedding, and is used in the manufacture of blankets, clothing, underwear, hosiery, gloves, sweaters and other garments. The evidence is to the effect that practically all the woolen cloth woven in this country contains some shoddy. That used to make comfortables is a different grade from that used in the textile industry. Some used by appellee for that purpose is made of clippings from new woolen underwear and other high grade and expensive materials. Comfortables made of secondhand shoddy sell at lower prices than those filled with other materials.\n Appellant claims that, in order properly to protect health, bedding material should be sterilized. The record shows that, for the sterilization of secondhand materials from which it makes shoddy, appellee uses effective steam sterilizers. There is no controversy between the parties as to whether shoddy may be rendered harmless by disinfection or sterilization. While it is sometimes made from filthy rags, and from other materials that have been exposed to infection, it stands undisputed that all dangers to health may be eliminated by appropriate treatment at low cost. In the course of its decision the District Court said:\n'It is conceded by all parties that shoddy may be rendered perfectly harmless by sterilization.'\n\n The act itself impliedly determines that proper sterilization is practicable and effective. It permits the use of second \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 412]\n\u00a0\n hand materials and new and secondhand feathers when sterilized, and it regulates processes for such sterilization.\n There was no evidence that any sickness or disease was ever caused by the use of shoddy, and the record contains persuasive evidence, and by citation discloses the opinions of scientists eminent in fields related to public health that the transmission of disease-producing bacteria is almost entirely by immediate contact with, or close proximity to, infected persons; that such bacteria perish rapidly when separated from human or animal organisms; and that there is no probability that such bacteria or vermin likely to carry them survive after the period usually required for the gathering of the materials, the production of shoddy, and the manufacture and the shipping of comfortables. This evidence tends strongly to show that in the absence of sterilization or disinfection there would be little, if any, danger to the health of the users of comfortables filled with shoddy, new or secondhand; and confirms the conclusion that all danger from the use of shoddy may be eliminated by ster ilization.\n The state has wide discretion in selecting things for regulation. We need not consider whether the mere failure to forbid the use of other filling materials that are mentioned in the act is sufficient in itself to invalidate the provision prohibiting the use of shoddy, as a violation of the equal protection clause. But the number and character of the things permitted to be used in such manufacture properly may be taken into account in deciding whether the prohibition of shoddy is a reasonable and valid regulation or is arbitrary and violative of the due process clause. Shoddy-filled comfortables made by appellee are useful articles for which there is much demand; and it is a matter of public concern that the production and sale of things necessary or convenient for use should not be forbidden. They are to be distinguished \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 413]\n\u00a0\n from things that the state is deemed to have power to suppress as inherently dangerous.\n Many states have enacted laws to regulate bedding for the protection of health. Legislation in Illinois (Laws 1915, p. 375) went beyond mere regulation, and prohibited the sale of secondhand quilts or comfortables, even when sterilized, or when remade from sterilized secondhand materials. In People v. Weiner, 110 N. E. 870, 271 Ill. 74, L. R. A. 1916C, 775, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 1065, the state Supreme Court held that to prohibit the use of material not inherently dangerous and that might be rendered safe by reasonable regulation trangresses the constitutional protection of personal and property rights.\n The appellant insists that this case is ruled by Powell v. Pennsylvania, 8 S. Ct. 992, 1257, \n127 U.S. 678\n. But the cases are essentially different. A law of Pennsylvania prohibited the manufacture, sale, or possession for sale, of oleomargarine. An indictment against Powell charged a sale and possession with intent to sell. At the trial he admitted the allegations and, for his defense, offered to prove certain facts which were excluded as immaterial. The question for decision was whether these facts were sufficient to show that, as applied, the law was invalid. Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court, said (8 S. Ct. 994, 127 U. S. p. 682) that the purpose of these offers of proof was to-\n'show that the article sold was a new invention, not an adulteration of dairy products, nor injurious to the public health, but wholesome and nutritious as an article of food. ... (8 S. Ct. 995, \n127 U.S. 684\n.) It will be observed that the offer in the court below was to show by proof that the particular articles the defendant sold, and those in his possession for sale, in violation of the statute, were, in fact, wholesome or nutritious articles of food. It is entirely consistent with that offer that many, indeed, that most kinds of oleomargarine butter in the market contain ingredients that are or may become injurious to health. The court cannot say, from anything of which it may take judicial cognizance, that \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 414]\n\u00a0\n such is not the fact. Under the circumstances disclosed in the record, and in obedience to settled rules of constitutional construction, it must be assumed that such is the fact.'\n\n And see Powell v. Commonwealth, 7 A. 913, 114 Pa. St. 265, 279, 295 ( 60 Am. Rep. 350).\n'Laws frequently are enforced which the court recognizes as possibly or probably invalid if attacked by a different interest or in a different way.' Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra, 32 S. Ct. 193, \n223 U.S. 64\n. This is well illustrated by the Powell Case, compared with Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, 18 S. Ct. 757, \n171 U.S. 1\n. Every opinion is to be read, having regard to the facts of the case and the question actually decided. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399. The facts clearly distinguish this case from the Powell Case. There it was assumed that most kinds of oleomargarine in the market were or might become injurious to health. Here it is established that sterilization eliminates the dangers, if any, from the use of shoddy. As against that fact, the provision in question cannot be sustained as a measure to protect health; and the fact that the act permits the use of numerous materials, prescribing sterilization if they are secondhand, also serves to show that the prohibition of the use of shoddy, new or old, even when sterilized, is unreasonable and arbitrary.\n\n Nor can such prohibition be sustained as a measure to prevent deception. In order to ascertain whether the materials used and the finished articles conform to its requirements, the act expressly provides for inspection of the places where such articles are made, sold or kept for sale. Every article of bedding is required to bear a tag showing the materials used for filling and giving the names and addresses of makers and vendors, and bearing the word 'second-hand' where there has been prior use, and giving the number of the permit for sterilizing and disinfecting where secondhand materials or feathers are used for filling. Obviously, these regulations or others \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 415]\n\u00a0\n that are adequate may be effectively applied to shoddy-filled articles.\n The constitutional guaranties may not be made to yield to mere convenience. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 46 S. Ct. 260, \n270 U.S. 230\n, decided March 1, 1926. The business here involved is legitimate and useful; and, while it is subject to all reasonable regulation, the absolute prohibition of the use of shoddy in the manufacture of comfortables is purely arbitrary and violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Adams v. Tanner, 37 S. Ct. 662, \n244 U.S. 590\n, 596, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973; Meyer v. Nebraska, 43 S. Ct. 625, \n262 U.S. 390\n, 29 A. L. R. 1446; Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 44 S. Ct. 412, \n264 U.S. 504\n, 32 A. L. R. 661.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n If the Legislature of Pennsylvania was of opinion that disease is likely to be spread by the use of unsterilized shoddy in comfortables I do not suppose that this Court would pronounce the opinion so manifestly absurd that it could not be acted upon. If we should not, then I think that we ought to assume the opinion to be right for the purpose of testing the law. The Legislature may have been of opinion further that the actual practice of filling comfortables with unsterilized shoddy gathered from filthy floors was wide spread, and this again we must assume to be true. It is admitted to be impossible to distinguish the innocent from the infected product in any practicable way, when it is made up into the comfortables. On these premises, if the Legislature regarded the danger as very great and inspection and tagging as inadequate remedies, it seems to me that in order to prevent the spread of disease it constitutionally could forbid any use of shoddy for bedding and upholstery. Notwithstanding the broad statement in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin the other day, I do not suppose that it was intended to overrule Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 33 S. Ct. 44, \n226 U.S. 192\n, and the other cases to which I referred there. \n\n[270 U.S. 402, 416]\n\u00a0\n It is said that there was unjustifiable discrimination. A classification is not to be pronounced arbitrary because it goes on practical grounds and attacks only those objects that exhibit or foster an evil on a large scale. It is not required to be mathematically precise and to embrace every case that theoretically is capable of doing the same harm. 'If the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied.' Miller v. Wilson, 35 S. Ct. 342, \n236 U.S. 373\n, 384 (59 L. Ed. 628, L. R. A. 1915F, 829). In this case, as in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, I think that we are pressing the Fourteenth Amendment too far.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN PAPER MAKERS' CHEMICAL CO. v. UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 312\nArgued: Decided: May 24, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[271 U.S. 268, 269]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry C. Howard, of Kalamazoo, Mich., for appellants.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Sol.

C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission was brought in the federal court for Western Michigan to enjoin in part, and to modify, certain orders of the Commission, which established through rates on rosin from Atlantic and Gulf ports to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids, Mich. The proceedings before the Commission originated in tariffs filed during 1923 by carriers operating in Southeast and Mississippi Valley territory. By these tariffs a comprehensive revision of rates on naval stores, including rosin, from all such points of production was proposed. Shippers, including these plaintiffs, protested. The proposed rates were suspended, and extensive hearings in which the plaintiffs participated were held. An order was entered requiring cancellation of the filed tariffs. A new schedule of rates, including those complained of by plaintiffs, was finally authorized. Naval Stores from Southern Producing Points to Various Destinations, 87 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 740; 89 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 634. Upon specific exceptions filed by the plaintiffs to the Kalamazoo and Grand Rap- \n\n[271 U.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n ids rates as proposed in the report of the examiner, the Commission found that these rates were neither unreasonable nor unjustly discriminatory. Western Paper Makers' Chemical Co. v. Director General, 91 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 223. The new rates to those cities are higher than the rates previously in effect. The Kalamazoo rates from Gulf ports are higher than those to Chicago; the Grand Rapids rates from Gulf ports are higher than those to Milwaukee.\n The case was heard in the District Court before three judges upon application for an interlocutory injunction. The plaintiffs claimed that the order was void in part, because the evidence introduced before the Commission did not justify the increased rates from Atlantic and Gulf ports to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids, because the establishment of rates from Gulf ports to these cities higher than those enjoyed by competing manufacturers at Chicago and Milwaukee was unjust discrimination against Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids, and because the new rates involved a violation of the long and short haul clause of section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8566). The court found against the plaintiffs on each of their contentions and denied the injunction. 7 F.(2d) 164. Upon submission of the case for final hearing a decree dismissing the bill was entered on January 3, 1925. A direct appeal to this court was taken under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220. The record included all the evidence introduced before the Commission. Pursuant to an order of this court, made on a motion of the plaintiffs for diminution of the record, counsel agreed upon a short statement of the whole evidence sufficient to enable this court to consider whether there was any evidence to support the findings of the Commission.\n The objections as presented here in brief and argument were addressed mainly to the soundness of the reasoning by which the Commission reached its conclusions. \n\n[271 U.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n It was urged that these are inconsistent with conclusions reached by it in similar cases, that the findings are inconsistent with some views expressed in its reports in this proceeding, that some evidence was improperly considered, and that inferences drawn from some of the evidence were unwarranted. These objections we have no occasion to discuss. The determination whether a rate is unreasonable or discriminatory is a question on which the finding of the Commission is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, unless there was some irregularity in the proceeding or some error in the application of the rules of law. Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 39 S. Ct. 375; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 204\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. No such irregularity or error is shown. In making its determinations the Commission is not hampered by mechanical rules governing the weight or effect of evidence. The mere admission of matter which under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings would be deemed incompetent does not invalidate its order. United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. There was ample evidence to support the finding that the joint through rates regarded as entireties were reasonable and justified. Prior existing rates, whether locals or such proportionate rates from a key point to points of destination as were made applicable to this particular class of traffic, or through rates upon other commodities moving from similar points of origin, are proper matters for consideration in establishing new through rates. To consider the weight of the evidence is beyond our province.\n Among the objections urged here was this: The rate from New Orleans to Chicago was fixed at 37 cents; that to Kalamazoo at 39. The rate from New Orleans to Milwaukee was fixed at 39 cents; that to Grand Rapids at 40. One of the many routes from the southern ports to Chicago theretofore open, was via Cincinnati and Kala- \n\n[271 U.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n mazoo; one of those to Milwaukee was via Cincinnati and Grand Rapids. These routes had been rarely used. If retained, they would have violated the long and short haul clause of section 4 of the interstate Commerce Act unless relief therefrom was granted by the Commission. See United States v. Merchants, etc., Association, \n242 \nU.S. 178\n, 37 S. Ct. 24. That relief it refused, and, to remove this obstacle to the higher Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids rates, it directed that these routes should be abandoned. The plaintiffs insist that the Commission could not lawfully close an existing route in order to avoid a fourth-section violation. The authority exercised was clearly within the broad discretion vested in the Commission. Compare Louisiana & Pine Bluff Ry. Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 114\n, 42 S.

Gen., for appellees.\n\n\n[270 U.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n George White, a soldier in the American army during the late war, on July 1, 1918, took out insurance upon his life for $10,000 under the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, article 4, s 400, 40 Stat. 398, 409 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 514u). He designated his mother, the appellant, as beneficiary, but by a letter of the same date, since established as his will, he provided that one-half of the sums paid shold go to his aunt, Lucy Reeves, who at that time was not among those to whom the statute allowed the policy to be made payable. Section 401 (section 514uu). He died on October 4, 1918, and thereafter monthly installments of $57.50 were paid to the mother through January, 1921. The award of the whole to her then was suspended on the ground that by the will the aunt was entitled to one-half. The Act of December 24, 1919, c. 16, s 13, 41 Stat. 371, 375 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, s 514uuu 3\/4), had enlarged the permitted class of beneficiaries to include aunts among others and had provided that the section should be deemed to be in effect as of October 6, 1917, and, with proper safeguards, that awards of insurance should be revised in accordance with the amended act. On October 9, 1923, the mother filed a petition under section 405 of the Act of 1917 and the Act of May 20, 1918, c. 77, 40 Stat. 555 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, s 514vvv, note), to establish her claim to the whole, and set up that to give effect to the Act of 1919 would be to deprive her of her property without due process of law contrary to the Constitution of the United States. The District Court decided in favor of the aunt. 229 F. 855.\n Mrs. White appealed to this court in August, 1924, and it fairly may be assumed that the Act of March 4, 1925, c. 553, 43 Stat. 1302, 1303 ( Comp. St. Supp. 1925, s 9127 1\/2-19), giving the appellate jurisdiction to the Circuit Court of Appeals does not apply.\n Mrs. White's argument, of course, is that, although the statute allowed a beneficiary to be named by will, it did \n\n[270 U.S. 175, 180]\n\u00a0\n not extend the benefit to aunts, so that her son's will was ineffective at the time when it was established; that therefore the mother's interest vested as absolute at the son's death, and could not be defeated by later legislation. But this argument fails when the precise position of the parties is understood.\n The certificate of insurance provided in terms that it should be 'subject in all respects to the provision of such Act (of 1917), of any amendments thereto, and of all regulations thereunder, now in force or hereafter adopted, all of which, together with the application for this insurance, and the terms and conditions published under authority of the Act, shall constitute the contract.' These words must be taken to embrace changes in the law no less than changes in the regulations. The form was established by the Director with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and on the authority of article 1, s 1, and article 4, s 402, of the Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, ss 514a, 514uuu), which, we have no doubt, authorized it. The language is very broad and does not need precise discussion when the nature of the plan is remembered The insurance was a contract, to be sure, for which a premium was paid, but it was not one entered into by the United States for gain. All soldiers were given a right to it and the relation of the Government to them if not paternal was at least avuncular. It was a relation of benevolence established by the Government at considerable cost to itself for the soldier's good. It was a new experiment in which changes might be found necessary, or at least, as in this case, feasible more exactly to carry out his will. If the soldier was willing to put himself into the government's hands to that extent no one else could complain. The only relations of contract were between the Government and him. White's mother's interest at his death was vested only so far as he and the Government had made it so, and was subject to any conditions upon which they might agree. They \n\n[270 U.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n did agree to terms that cut her rights down to one-half. She is a volunteer and she cannot claim more. See Helmholz v. Horst (C. C.

H. Hedrick and C., and O. R. McGuire, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. H. Lawrence, of San Francisco, Cal., and Alexander Britton and Lawrence H. Cake, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was begun by a petition filed by Ynchausti & Co. January 19. 1925, in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, under section 2947 of the Compiled Acts of the Philippine Commission 1907, for an original \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 641]\n\u00a0\n writ of mandamus directed to Ben F. Wright, insular auditor, to require him to countersign a warrant for 159,960 pesos drawn by the insular collector of customs in favor of Ynchausti & Co. The insular auditor filed an answer, to which the petition demurred, on the ground that the facts stated therein were not sufficient to constitute a defense. The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands sustained the demurrer and ordered that the writ issue as prayed. This court granted a certiorari April 26, 1926. \n271 \nU.S. 652\n, 46 S. Ct. 481\n\n\n Ynchausti & Co. were the agents and operator of the steamship Venus, a vessel engaged in the coastwise trade in the Philippine Islands. They sent her to Hong Kong, a crown colony of Great Britain, there to receive certain heavy repairs and construction work. When the vessel returned to the Philippines, the insular collector of customs, who is collector at Manila, and who has subordinate collectors at other ports, assessed a customs duty of 159,960 pesos on account of the repairs. Ynchausti & Co. paid the duty, but filed a protest with the collector, on the ground that the repairs were free from duty under the law. The collector deposited the money in the insular treasury. Upon a hearing of the protest and an examination of evidence, the collector reversed his ruling, rendered a decision sustaining the protest, and ordered a refund of the money paid under a permanent appropriation for such purposes. A copy of the collector's decision was sent to the secretary of finance and the insular auditor. The secretary of finance did not certify a desire to appeal from the insular collector's decision to the court of first instance within 15 days thereafter, as authorized by law, although the insular auditor urged it. After the time for an appeal had expired, a warrant was drawn by the insular collector in favor of Ynchausti & Co. for the amount of the duty paid. Upon presentation of the warrant to the insular auditor for his \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 642]\n\u00a0\n countersignature, required by the Administrative Code of the Islands to be attached to every warrant, he withheld it.\n By sections 614, 616, 621, of the Insular Administrative Code of 1917, revenue funds are not to be withdrawn from the insular treasury, except upon warrant. Warrants are to be drawn upon the insular treasury by the chief of the bureau or office having control of the appropriation or fund against which such warrants are chargeable, and are to be made payable to the creditor to whom the money is due. No insular warrant is to be paid by the treasurer until countersigned by the auditor. By section 3920 of the Compiled Laws of the Philippines of 1907 a permanent appropriation is provided for refund of duties paid into the treasury in excess of the final liquidation and the amount legally due.\n The history of the legislation in respect to classification for duties on repairs of Philippine vessels made in a foreign country is as follows:\n The Philippine Tariff Act of Congress of August 5, 1909, 36 Stat. 130, c. 8,  8, provided:\n'That the rates of duties to be collected on articles, goods, wares, or merchandise imported into the Philippine Islands, or going into said islands from the United States or any of its possessions except as otherwise provided in this act, shall be as follows: ...\n\n'Per. 200. Boats, launches, lighters, and other water craft, set up or knocked down, imported into the Philippine Islands, and cost of repairs made in foreign countries to vessels, or to parts thereof, documented for the Philippine coastwise trade or plying exclusively in Philippine waters and for which repairs adequate facilities are afforded in the Philippine Islands, fifty per centum ad valorem:\n\n'Provided, that upon proof satisfactory to the collector of customs that adequate facilities are not afforded \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 643]\n\u00a0\n in the Philippine Islands for such repairs, the same shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph three hundred and forth-eight of this act.'\n\n Paragraph 348 is part of section 11 of the same act, and declares that certain imports shall be free of duty upon the importation thereof into the Philippine Islands. One is described as follows:\n'Repairs to vessle documented in the Philippine Islands or regularly plying in Philippine waters, made in foreign countries, upon proof satisfactory to the collector of customs that adequate facilities for such repairs are not afforded in the Philippine Islands.'\n\n This Tariff Act was amended by the Philippine Legislature under the authority of the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, 39 Stat. 545, c. 416, usually called the Jones Act, by section 10 of which it is provided:\n'That while this act provides that the Philippine government shall have the authority to enact a tariff law the trade relations between the islands and the United States shall continue to be governed exclusively by laws of the Congress of the United States: Provided, that tariff acts or acts amendatory to the tariff of the Philippine Islands shall not become law until they shall receive the approval of the President of the United States.' Comp. St.  3812a.\n\n Acting under this authority, the Philippine Legislature passed an amendment to the Tariff Act, entitled No. 2872, which was approved by the President of the United States on November 24, 1919. That act amended section 200, already quoted, by continuing the duty on repairs at 50 per centum until December 31, 1924, and then reducing the rate to 25 per cent. thereafter, and changed the proviso as follows:\n'Provided, that upon proof satisfactory to the collector of customs that adequate facilities are not afforded in the Philippine Islands for such repairs, so that the work cannot be done there reasonably, economically, and \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 644]\n\u00a0\n within a reasonable time, in the judgment of said collector, such repairs shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph three hundred and forty-eight of this act.'\n\n The question here presented is whether the Philippine auditor may consider and reverse the ruling of the insular collector in respect to the refund of the duties paid on these repairs, or whether the ruling of the insular collector under the circumstances is final, and the necessary countersigning of the warrant drawn by the insular collector is merely a ministerial duty, subjecting the auditor to mandamus.\n The Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, to provide a more autonomous government for the Philippines, known as the Jones Act (39 Stat. 545, c. 416,  24), describes the present powers and duties of the insular auditor in part as follows:\n'That there shall be appointed by the President an auditor, who shall examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenues and receipts from whatever source of the Philippine government and of the provincial and municipal governments of the Philippines, including trust funds and funds derived from bond issues; and audit, in accordance with law and administrative regulations, all expenditures of funds or property pertaining to or held in trust by the government or the provinces or municipalities thereof. He shall perform a like duty with respect to all government branches.\n\n'He shall keep the general accounts of the government and preserve the vouchers pertaining thereto.\n\n'It shall be the duty of the auditor to bring to the attention of the proper administrative officer expenditures of funds or property which, in his opinion, are irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant . ...\n\n'The administrative jurisdiction of the auditor over accounts, whether of funds or property, and all vouchers and records pertaining thereto, shall be exclusive. With \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 645]\n\u00a0\n the approval of the Governor General he shall from time to time make and promulgate general or special rules and regulations not inconsistent with law covering the method of accounting for public funds and property, and funds and property held in trust by the government or any of its branches. ...\n\n'The decisions of the auditor shall be final and conclusive upon the executive branches of the government, except that appeal therefrom may be taken by the party aggrieved or the head of the department concerned within one year, in the manner hereinafter prescribed. The auditor shall, except as hereinafter provided, have like authority as that conferred by law upon the several auditors of the United States and the Comptroller of the United States Treasury and is authorized to communicate directly with any person having claims before him for settlement, or with any department, officer, or person having official relations with his office. ...' Comp. St.  3817d.\n\n In the administration of his duty, he is authorized to summon witnesses, administer oaths, and to take evidence and enforce the attendance of witnesses.\n Section 25 provides:\n'That any person aggrieved by the action or decision of the auditor in the settlement of his account or claim may, within one year, take an appeal in writing to the Governor General, which appeal shall specifically set forth the particular action of the auditor to which exception is taken, with the reason and authorities relied on for reversing such decision.\n\n'If the Governor General shall confirm the action of the auditor, he shall so indorse the appeal and transmit it to the auditor, and the action shall thereupon be final and conclusive. Should the Governor General fail to sustain the action of the auditor, he shall forthwith transmit his grounds of disapproval to the Secretary of War, together with the appeal and the papers necessary to a \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 646]\n\u00a0\n proper understanding of the matter. The decision of the Secretary of War in such case shall be final and conclusive.' Comp. St.  3817e.\n\n The argument is that, as the subject-matter here is a claim against the insular treasury, it is necessarily exclusively within the broad powers of the auditor to pass on it, and that his duty to countersign the warrant for it includes this discretion, which can only be reviewed by the Governor General and the Secretary of War. There is no doubt that from the beginning of the civil government in the Philippines, established by the President as commander-in-chief, in 1901, it was his intention to give to the Secretary of War the means of supervising the disbursements of the funds in the Philippine treasury and the allowance of claims upon them through the insular auditor who was to be appointed by the Secretary of War. Presidential Order Feb. 23, 1901, Act. No. 90, Public Laws Enacted by the Philippine Commission, vol. 1, p. 160. There was substituted by the Philippine Commission for Act No. 90, the Accounting Act, No. 1402, in 1905 (op. cit. vol. 5, p. 58), and the new Accounting Act, No. 1792, in 1907 (op. cit. vol. 6, p. 475). Then followed the Administrative Act of 1916, by the Philippine Legislature, which created a board of audits, with the auditor at its head, and this was repeated in the Administrative Code of 1917, c. 26, enacted after the passage of the Jones Act. The scope of duties of the auditor as conferred in Act No. 90 is substantially the same as in the acts which have followed it. It was said in all these acts, including the Jones Act, that the insular auditor should have the same authority as the several auditors of the United States and the Comptroller of the Treasury.\n Parallel with this legislation, however, was the Customs Administrative Act of 1902, No. 355, Public Laws Enacted by the Philippine Commission, vol. 1, p. 788, which organized the bureau of customs on February 6, 1902, \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 647]\n\u00a0\n very shortly before the passage by Congress of an act temporarily to provide revenue for the Philippine Islands, March 8, 1902 (32 Stat. 54, c. 140), confirming the Tariff Act passed by the Commission in September, 1901, No. 230, Public Laws Enacted by Philippine Commission, vol. 1, p. 581. By that act, and by all subsequent amending acts on the subject, collectors of customs were given the duty of liquidating the duties, of determining abatements for manifest clerical error, and for loss or damage of goods, and of promptly granting refunds as allowances or abatements, and those claims thus allowed by the collectors were to be certified to the auditor of the Islands, with their recommendations and with all necessary papers and documents. This was provided evidently to permit prompt correction of clerical and other obvious errors by the collector. The auditor was directed to audit the same and draw the warrant for the refund so forwarded in settlement therefor, if found correct. The foregoing is embodied in existing law in the Administrative Act of 1917, and it may be that in such a case, by reason of the language used, the insular auditor is given discretion to withhold his approval of a refund thus granted by the collector. We do not find it necessary to decide that question, and only mention it in order to make clear the question before us and what we are deciding.\n What we are here dealing with is not clerical or other obvious errors in collections but controversies over the classification of articles for duty under the Tariff Act and the determination of the duties to be assessed upon such articles by the collector, accompanied and contested by a filed protest of the importer. In such a case a different system has been provided from the beginning in 1902. By sections 286, 287, 288, and 289 of the Customs Administrative Act of 1902, provision was made for the clas- \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 648]\n\u00a0\n sification of the imports and the fixing of duties by the collector and their collection, a protest by a taxpayer who objected, an appeal on that protest to the insular collector, an appeal from his decision by the defeated taxpayer to a court created by the act, called a Court of Customs Appeals, which conclusively decided the question. This law also provided that, if the decision of the insular collector was adverse to the government, the secretary of finance and justice, the head of the department, might within a certain time initiate an appeal to the Court of Customs Appeals. Thereafter the personnel of the Court of Customs Appeals was changed in Act No. 864, September 2, 1903, Public Laws Enacted by the Philippine Commission, vol. 9, p. 3, and an appeal given, upon the disagreement between the Judges of the Court of Customs Appeals, to the Supreme Court.\n By Act No. 1405, adopted by the Commission October 13, 1905, Public Laws, vol. 5, p. 75, the Court of Customs Appeals was abolished and its duties were transferred to the court of first instance, with an appeal to the Supreme Court, and these changes were all embodied in the compilation of the statutes made in 1907, and have been continued since in the administrative acts of 1916 and 1917. No change in the administration of the bureau of customs or the bureau of audits was made by the Philippine Tariff Act of Congress of August 5, 1909 (36 Stat. 130, c. 8), which supplanted the Tariff Act of the Philippine Commission of 1902.\n The present procedure fixed by Philippine law for raising the question of the legality of classification for duty on importations and of the collection of such duties is to be found in the Administrative Code of the Islands of 1917, already cited, made necessary by the passage of the Jones Act.\n The relevant sections of the Code follow:\n'Section 1383. The party aggrieved by the decision of the insular collector in any matter brought before him \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 649]\n\u00a0\n upon protest or by his action or decision in any case of seizure may procure the cause to be removed for review into the court of first instance sitting in the city of Manila, in the manner and within the period hereinafter prescribed.\n\n'Unless the proper party in interest shall procure the cause to be thus removed into court for review, the action or decision of the insular collector shall be final and conclusive against him.\n\n'Section 1384. The removal of a cause into court may be had at the instance of the protesting party, or in case of seizure, at the instance of the owner or agent of the seized property. If the decision of the insular collector is adverse to the government the cause may also be removed in the manner hereinafter specified, by order of the department head.'\n\n'Section 1386. Upon making any decision which may be removed upon the order of the department head, the insular collector shall immediately transmit a copy of such decision to him and also to the insular auditor; and if within fifteen days thereafter the department head shall certify that in his opinion the decision ought to be revised by the court of first instance in the city of Manila, it shall be the duty of the insular collector, upon notification thereof, to transmit the original record to said court in the same manner as upon removal by a party other than the government.'\n\n This history shows that, since the beginning of civil government in the Philippines, the policy of the Island government has been to take out of the jurisdiction of the auditor contested claims for refund of duties based on protest, and involving a reexamination of the action of the local collectors of customs by the insular collector in assessing such duties. The decisions of the insular collector with respect to refunds of this class were administratively final, but appeals from his conclusions, \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 650]\n\u00a0\n if duly taken, became the subject of judicial examination, at first by the Court of Customs Appeals, and afterwards by the court of first instance of the proper jurisdiction, and by the Supreme Court.\n It is thus quite clear that the provision of the Jones Act, and of acts which preceded it, for review of the decisions of administrative officers by the insular auditor, from which appeals could be taken to the Governor general of the Islands, and thence to the Secretary of War, was not intended to include decisions upon protested classification of duties under the Tariff Act.\n The unchanged policy as to such decisions is that appeal from the insular collector's action should be left to the taxpayer, on the one hand, and to the head of finance department, on the other, and, if taken, should be considered by the courts, and that, failing such appeal, the action of the insular collector should be final. It would be incongruous to provide for appeal to the courts at the instance of either the importer or the head of the department, and, in the absence of such appeal by either, to have a review by the auditor. It would delay decision of the legality of the classification for a year. It would create two tribunals of appeals in respect to classification, which might cause embarrassing and confusing conflict.\n It has not been directly argued, but there has been an intimation in the argument for the petitioner that greater weight is to be attached to the congressional acts, including the Jones Act, in defining the duties of the auditor, than to the provisions of the Customs Administrative Act of 1902, and of the Administrative Acts of 1916 and 1917, fixing the duties of the insular collector in classification of duties and appeals to the courts, which were acts only of the Philippine Commission or the Philippine Legislature without specific congressional approval. If there were a conflict between the two, of course, the congressional legislation must control. But conflict is not to be pre- \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 651]\n\u00a0\n sumed because, first, under the letter of the President in establishing the Philippine Commissions of date April 7, 1900, Public Acts Enacted by the Philippine Commission, vol. 1, p. lxiii; second, under the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 691, c. 1369), confirming the prior legislative action of the Philippine Commission, and vesting future legislative power in the Commission and in a subsequent Legislature therein provided for; and, third, under the Jones Act (39 Stat. 545, c. 416), changing somewhat the form of the Philippine government, all general legislative power was vested in the Island Legislature, with some exceptions, of which none included the administrative provisions for collecting the customs revenue. Of course, all such legislation was subject to annulment by Congress, but, although the legislative provisions for action by the insular collector of customs and the courts in respect to classification of imports and collection of duties were established in 1902, and continue until to-day, they have never been disturbed, and have evidently never been thought by Congress to be in conflict with the powers of the auditor.\n In view of this legislative history, it is not difficult to reach a conclusion and to define what the function of the auditor of the Islands in such a case as this is. To take money out of the treasury on appropriation, a warrant has to be drawn by the head of the bureau having the payment of the claim in charge, and the warrant must be counter-signed by the insular auditor before it is paid; but, where the insular auditor is not vested with administrative discretion to pass upon the merits of the claim for which the warrant is drawn, his only function is to determine whether the warrant is drawn by the proper officer upon the decision of the proper tribunal, and is applicable to an existing appropriation, and having been satisfied as to these preliminaries, his duty is merely ministerial. In this case, having ascertained that \n\n[272 U.S. 640, 652]\n\u00a0\n the insular collector has rendered an opinion that was final by reason of a failure of either party to appeal to the court therefrom, it is his duty to countersign the warrant, and such a duty may be controlled by mandamus. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524; Work v. United States ex rel. McAlester-Edwards Coal Co., \n262 \nU.S. 200\n, 43 S. Ct. 580; Work v. United States ex rel. Mosier, \n261 \nU.S. 352\n, 43 S. Ct. 389.\n We may add that such a conclusion is quite in keeping with the functions of the Auditors of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Treasury of the United States, a comparison which is constantly used in the Philippine statutes. Neither the Auditors nor the Comptroller of the Treasury of the United States is vested with authority to decide questions of classification of duties under tariff acts. Those are considered and disposed of, first by the collectors of customs, then by appeal after written notice to a Board of General Appraisers, and then by a review by the Court of Customs Appeals.

UNITED STATES(1926)\nNo. 250\nArgued: October 7, 1926Decided: November 22, 1926\n\n\n\n\n[272 U.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jennings C. Wise, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By section 22 of the Indian Appropriation Act of April 4, 1910, c. 140, 36 Stat. 269, 284, jurisdiction was conferred upon the Court of Claims 'to hear, and report a finding of fact, as between the United States and the Yankton Tribe of Indians of South Dakota as to the interest, title, ownership, and right of possession of the said tribe' to a tract of land lying in the state of Minnesota embracing the red pipestone quarries. That court, narrowly construing its powers, reported to Congress findings of fact, without passing upon the question of title or determining any issue of law. 53 Ct. Cl. 67, 81. Congress subse- \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n quently, on June 3, 1920 (41 Stat. 738, c. 222), conferred upon the same court jurisdiction to adjudicate all claims of the Sioux Indians against the United States, and under that act these Indians filed their petition in this proceeding, praying judgment for an amount which would compensate them, should it be found that the land in question had been misappropriated by the defendant. On January 9, 1925, while the case was pending, jurisdiction was conferred more definitely upon the same court to determine from the findings of fact theretofore made 'the interest, title, ownership, and right of possession of the Yankton Band of Santee Sioux Indians in and to the land known as the 'red pipestone quarries,\" and thereupon to determine, and enter judgment for, the amount 'legally and equitably due from the United States' to petitioner for the same. 43 Stat. 730, c. 59. That court, in addition to its previous findings of fact, has now found that the Indians had been and still are permitted freely to visit and procure stone from the quarries and that they are free to do so as long as they may desire. Concluding that under the treaty of 1858 (11 Stat. 743) the only interest possessed by the tribe in the quarries was this right, which had never been denied, the court dismissed the petition. 61 Ct. Cl. 40.\n By the treaty of 1858, these Indians ceded to the United States all the lands then owned, possessed, or claimed by them, wherever sitnated, except a particularly described tract of 400,000 acres. In consideration of that cession, among other things, the United States agreed(article 8, p. 746) that:\n'The said Yancton Indians shall be secured in the free and unrestricted use of the red pipestone quarry, or so much thereof as they have been accustomed to frequent and use for the purpose of procuring stone for pipes; and the United States hereby stipulate and agree to cause to be surveyed and marked so much thereof as shall be necessary and proper for that purpose, \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n and retain the same and keep it open and free to the Indians to visit and procure stone for pipes so long as they shall desire.'\n\n In accordance with this agreement, the tract here in question, containing about 648 acres, was so surveyed and marked.\n It is quite clear from all the surrounding circumstances that the Indians understood that by this provision there was granted to them full ownership of the tract, and their claim to that effect they have always persistently and stoutly maintained. The validity of that claim the government has sometimes denied, and at other times apparently conceded. One conspicuous example of the latter character may be cited. In 1889 (25 Stat. 1012, c. 421), Congress provided for the appraisement of the tract and the ascertainment of the actual value of a strip of land upon it then occupied by a railway company and the damage to the remainder of the tract by reason of the taking of the strip for railroad purposes. As a result of this legislation, $1,740 was collected from the railroad company and paid to the Indians. By the same act it was provided that no part of the tract should be sold without the consent of a majority of the adult male members of the tribe, and that the proceeds of sales should be credited to the annuity fund of the Indians, or expended according to their determination.\n Nevertheless the extent and character of the interest of the Indians has continued to be more or less in controversy. In 1891 (26 Stat. 764, c. 240), provision was made for establishing Indian industrial and training schools in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, that in Minnesota to be located on the quarry tract. Under this act a school was established on the tract and opened early in 1893; possession being taken, it is conceded, of the entire tract. In the meantime, negotiations with the Indians had resulted in an agreement for the cession of an additional 150,000 acres of land, which agreement was \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n ratified by Congress in 1894. 28 Stat. 314, c. 290. In part consideration of the cession the agreement contains the following article:\n'Art. XVI. If the government of the United States questions the ownership of the Pipestone reservation by the Yankton Tribe of Sioux Indians, under the treaty of April 19, 1858, including the fee to the land as well as the right to work the quarries, the Secretary of the Interior shall as speedily as possible refer the matter to the Supreme Court of the United States, to be decided by that tribunal . ...\n\n'If the Secretary of the Interior shall not, within one year after the ratification of this agreement by Congress, refer the question of the ownership of said Pipestone reservation to the Supreme Court, as provided for above, such failure upon his part shall be construed as, and shall be, a waiver by the United States of all rights to the ownership of the said Pipestone reservation, and the same shall thereafter be solely the property of the Yankton tribe of the Sioux Indians, including the fee to the land.'\n\n Concluding that the provision for referring the matter to this court was beyond the constitutional power of Congress, the Secretary made no attempt to carry that part of the article into operation beyond submitting the question for the opinion of the Attorney General. That officer advised that compliance with it was impracticable. There the matter rested until 1897, at which time Congress, apparently on the theory that the Indian title had vested under the second paragraph of the article, by reason of the failure of the Secretary to refer the matter to this court under the first paragraph, directed the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate with the Indians for the purchase of the land. 30 Stat. 62, 87, c. 3. Negotiations were had with the Indians and an agreement made for the transfer of their interests to the United States for the sum of $100,000, which agreement was transmitted to \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n Congress and referred to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. A majority of the committee reported adversely, but no action upon the report or upon the matter appears to have been taken by Congress. The acts of legislation and the proceedings in the Court of Claims followed as already outlined.\n The lower court held, first, that the right reserved to the Indians by the treaty of 1858 was a mere easement, and this the government had not interfered with; and, second, that article XVI did not operate to enlarge this right but was a mere direction to refer the question of title to this court, and, since that involved an unconstitutional attempt to extend the original jurisdiction of the court, the provision on its face was impossible of performance, and therefore void.\n We pass the first ground without considering it, and come at once to the second. To begin with, it is not clear that the undertaking to refer the question to this court was impossible of performance. The Attorney General, to whom the question was referred by the Secretary of the Interior, advised only that it was 'impracticable.' That it could not have been referred directly to this court is obvious, since that would have been to invoke an original jurisdiction which the court cannot exercise under the Constitution. But the matter might have gone to an inferior court and have been brought here by appeal, necessary legislation to that end, so far as required, being provided. Such a process, if it would not have satisfied the letter, would, at least, have satisfied the purpose of the provision. See The Harriman, 9 Wall. 161, 172-173; Beebe v. Johnson, 19 Wend. (N. Y.) 500, 32 Am. Dec. 518.\n We prefer, however, to rest our decision upon other considerations. The pipestone quarries are of great antiquity. There the tribes, from time immemorial, have been wont to gather, under solemn truce, to quarry the stone, which is of a quality and texture not found else \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n where, and mold it into pipes-the Indian symbols of peace. A great store of Indian myth and legend is associated with the spot, and it always has been regarded by the tribesmen with sentiments bordering upon religious reverence. While transferring to the United States their possessory title to other lands, the Indians had steadfastly refused to surrender what they conceived to be their peculiar right to this tract. Under these circumstances, it is by no means certain that they would have agreed to the cession at all without the provision in question. However that may be, it cannot be doubted that they regarded the undertaking of the government set forth in article XVI, as of great value, accepted it in good faith, and relied with the utmost confidence upon the alternative promise of Congress that, in the event the matter was not referred to this court, all claims of the government to the ownership of the tract would cease and the Indian title in fee be conclusively established.\n To deny all efficacy to that part of the undertaking upon the ground that the other part was impossible of performance, and at the same time hold these wards of the government to the terms of the cession for which the undertaking formed so important an element of consideration, would be most inequitable and utterly indefensible upon any moral ground, and this is peculiarly true, in view of the attitude of Congress in so dealing with the matter from time to time, as hereinbefore recited, as to justify a belief on the part of the Indians that their ownership was conceded. It is impossible, however, to rescind the cession and restore the Indianss to their former rights, because the lands have been opened to settlement and large portions of them are now in the possession of innumerable innocent purchasers, and nothing remains but to sanction a great injustice or enforce the alternative agreement of the United States in respect of the ownership of the Indians. The latter course is so \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n manifestly in accordance with ordinary conceptions of fairness that it would be unfortunate if any positive rule of law stood in the way of its accomplishment. We are of opinion that none exists. The judgment of the Court of Claims, that such an obstruction is to be found in the conclusion that the provision for referring the controversy to this court was legally impossible of execution, cannot be sustained.\n The general rule undoubtedly is that, where there is a legal impossibility of performance appearing on the face of the promise there is no contract in respect of it. But here the undertaking of the government is in the alternative-that either the question of the title of the Indians shall be referred to this court for determination, or, in default of that being done, title in fee shall vest in the Indians. Granted the impossibility of the first alternative, the government, nevertheless, took the risk, and must, in accordance with its definite undertaking to that effect, suffer the stipulated consequence, in virtue of the principle that, where promises are in the alternative, the fact that one of them is at the time, or subsequently becomes, impossible of performance does not, at least without more, relieve the promisor from performing the other.\n In Stevens v. Webb, 7 Car. & P. 60, 62, the defendant gave a bond in the sum of 35 to obtain the release of a prisoner held in custody on a ca. sa., conditional to surrender him at a fine fixed. The court held the condition void on the ground that a defendant in execution once discharged out of custody by the plaintiff could not by law be retaken upon that judgment, but, nevertheless, enforced payment of the penalty, saying:\n'There was therefore one branch of the agreement that the defendant could not perform; and the law is, that, if an agreement is in the alternative, and one branch of the alternative cannot be performed, the party is bound to perform the other, which, in this case, is to pay 35.'\n\n There is an \n\n[272 U.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n earlier decision, rendered in 1798 in the Court of Common Pleas, upon exactly similar facts, to the same effect. Da Costa v. Davis, 1 Bos. & P. 242. In Drake v. White, 117 Mass. 10, 13, Stevens v. Webb, supra, was cited as authority for the proposition that, where one part of an alternative promise, originally possible, has subsequently become impossible of fulfillment, the other part of the alternative must nevertheless be performed. See also Mill Dam Foundery v. Hovey, 21 Pick. ( Mass.) 417, 443; State v. Executors of Thomas Worthington, 7 Ohio, 171, 173, pt. 1; Jacquinet v. Boutron, 19 La. Ann. 30, 32.\n That the United States has taken and holds possession of the entire quarry tract of 648 acres is not in dispute; and since the Indians are the owners of it in fee, they are entitled to just compensation as for a taking under the power of eminent domain.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","225":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYU CONG ENG v.

The petitioner, Yu Cong Eng, was charged by information in the court of first instance of Manila, with its violation. He was arrested, his books were seized, and the trial was about to proceed, when he and the other petitioner, Co Liam, on \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 507]\n\u00a0\n their own behalf, and on behalf of all the other Chinese merchants in the Philippines, filed the petition against the fiscal, or prosecuting attorney of Manila, and the collector of internal revenue engaged in the prosecution, and against the judge presiding.\n By the Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippine Islands,  516, the Philippine Supreme Court is granted concurrent jurisdiction in prohibition with courts of first instance over inferior tribunals or persons, and original jurisdiction over courts of first instance, when such courts are exercising functions without or in excess of their jurisdiction. It has been held by that court that the question of the validity of a criminal statute must usually be raised by a defendant in the trial court and be carried regularly in review to the Supreme Court. Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Company v. Del Rosario, 26 Philippine Reports, 192. But in this case, where a new act seriously affected numerous persons and extensive property rights, and was likely to cause a multiplicity of actions, the Supreme Court exercised its discretion to bring the issue of the act's validity promptly before it and decide it in the interest of the orderly administration of justice. The court relied by analogy upon the cases of Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764, Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S. Ct. 7, L. R.

Although objection to the jurisdiction was raised by demurrer to the petition, this is now disclaimed on behalf of the respondents, and both parties ask a decision on the merits. In view of broad powers in prohibition granted to that court under the Island Code, we acquiesce in the desire of the parties.\n Act No. 2972, the validity of which is attacked, was passed by the Philippine Legislature, and approved February 21, 1921. It reads as follows:\n'No. 2972. An act to provide in what languages account books shall be kept, and to establish penalties for its violation.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 500, 508]\n\u00a0\n 'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:\n'Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any person, company, or partnership or corporation engaged in commerce, industry or any other activity for the purpose of profit in the Philippine Islands, in accordance with existing law, to keep its account books in any language other than English, Spanish or any local dialect.\n\n'Sec. 2. Any person violating the provisions of this act shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.\n\n'Sec. 3. This act shall take effect on November 1st, nineteen hundred and twenty-one.'\n\n This was amended as to its date by a subsequent act and it did not take effect until January 1, 1923. Various efforts were made to repeal the act or amend it, but they were defeated.\n The petition, after setting out the prosecution in the court of first instance, and the text of the act, avers that the petitioner Yu Cong Eng is a chinese merchant engaged in the wholesale lumber business in Manila; that he neither reads, writes nor understands the English or Spanish language or any local dialect; that he keeps the books of account of his business in Chinese characters; that by reason of his ignorance of the English and Spanish languages and of all local dialects he is unable to keep his books in any other language than his own; that, even if he should employ a bookkeeper capable of keeping his books in the English or Spanish language, he would have no means of personally revising or ascertaining the contents or correctness of the books thus kept; that the employment of such a bookkeeper, unless he should be a linguist, would entail as a necessary consequence the employment of a translator or interpreter familiar with the \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n Chinese language and the language or dialect in which such books might be kept, in order to enable the petitioner to ascertain by hearsay the contents thereof; that he would be completely at the mercy of such employees, who, if dishonest, might cheat and defraud him of the proceeds of his business, and involve him in criminal or civil liability in its conduct; that under the provisions of the act he is prohibited from even keeping a duplicate set of accounts in his own language, and would, in the event of the enforcement of the law, be compelled to remain in total ignorance of the status of his business; and that the enforcement of the act would drive the petitioner and many other Chinese merchants in the Philippines who do 60 per cent. of the business of the Islands and who are in like circumstance, out of business.\n The petition avers that the other petitioner in this case, Co Liam, is a Chinese person and conducts a small general merchandise business in Manila, commonly known in the Philippines as a Chinese tienda; that he carries a stock of goods of about 10,000 pesos, or $5,000; that his sales taxes amount to from 40 to 60 pesos per quarter; that he neither reads, writes, nor understands the English or Spanish language or any local dialect; that he keeps books of account of his small business in Chinese, the only language known to him, without the assistance of a bookkeeper; that he has been losing money for some time in the operation of his business, but that even in prosperous times his profits could never be sufficient to justify the employment of a Filipino bookkeeper, and that without the opportunity to keep Chinese books, be would be kept completely ignorant of the changing condition of his business, were he compelled to keep his books in English, Spanish, or a local dialect; and that the enforcement of the act would drive him and all the small merchants or tienda keepers in the Islands who are Chinese out of business. \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners aver that the act, if enforced, will deprive the petitioners, and the 12,000 Chinese merchants whom they represent, of their liberty and property without due process of law, and deny them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, c. 416,  3, 39 Stat. 546 (Comp. St.  3810).\n An amendment to the petition set up the rights of the petitioners under the treaty now in force between the United States and China, alleging that under it the petitioners are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and immunities as the citizens and subjects of Great Britain and Spain, and that the treaty has the force and effect of a law of Congress, which this law violates.\n An answer was filed by the fiscal, which is a general denial of the averments of the petition as to the effect of the law. He avers that the law is valid and necessary, and is only the exercise of proper legislative power, because the government of the Philippine Islands depends upon the taxes and imposts which it may collect in order to carry out its functions, and the determination of whether the mercantile operations of the merchants are or are not subject to taxation, as well as the fixing of its amount, cannot and ought not to be left to the mercy of those who are to bear it; that due to the inability of the officials of the internal revenue to revise and check up properly the correctness of the books of account which the Chinese merchants keep in their own language, the public treasury loses every year very large sums.\n Evidence was taken on the issues made. A majority of the Supreme Court held that, if the act were construed and enforced literally, it would probably be invalid, but by giving it an interpretation different from the usual meaning of the words employed it could stand. Two of the justices dissented, on the ground that the \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n court had exceeded its powers and by legislation made it a different act.\n There are two tax laws from which a substantial part of the revenue of the Islands is derived. There is a sales tax of 1 1\/2 per cent. on the gross sales of businesses and occupations for which a quarterly return is required. Administrative Code,  1453, et seq., Act 3065. There is also an income tax. The annual revenue accruing from the sales tax is roughly 10, 000,000 pesos, and that from the income tax about 2,000,000 pesos.\n Another statute is the so-called Code of Commerce, brought over from the Spanish Code, the thirty-third article of which provides that all merchants shall keep a book of inventories and balances, a day book, a ledger, a copy book of telegrams, letters, etc., and such other books as may be required by special laws. Under the provisions of that Code and the internal revenue law, the colector of internal revenue is authorized to require the keeping of daily records of sales, and makes regulations prescribing the manner in which the proper books, invoices and other papers should be kept and entries made therein by the persons subject to the sales tax. R. 1164, Act No. 2339,  5, 6; Administrative Code,  1424( j).\n Chinese merchants are said to have been in the Philippines even before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1520. The Chinese written language is an ancient language, with a literature and with characters quite different from those used in European languages. There are many different native dialects in the Philippines. Forty-three is said to be the number; but there are less than a dozen of these which may be regarded as important-the Tagalog, the Visayan, with two distinct main dialects, the Ilocano, the Bical, the Pampangan, the Ibanag, the Pangasananian, and the Moro. Perhaps from 7 to 10 per cent. of the Filipinos speak Spanish. A great many (how large the percentage one cannot tell) of the younger people in the \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 512]\n\u00a0\n Islands speak English. It is a polygot situation, and presents many difficulties in government. Comparatively few of the Chinese speak English or Spanish, or the native dialects, with any facility at all, and less are able to write or to read either. But with capacity and persistence in trade, by signs and by a patois, they communicate with the Filipinos and others with whom they do business, making their calculations with the abacus, an instrument for mechanical calculation, and keeping their books in Chinese characters in ink, applied by a brush to strong paper, securely bound. They have a scientific system of double entry bookkeeping.\n There are 85,000 merchants in the Philippines to whom the bookkeeping law applies. Of these, 71,000 are Filipinos, who may use their own dialects; 1,500 are Americans, or British or Spanish subjects; 500 are of other foreign nationalities, most of whom know the Spanish or English language. The remainder, some 12,000 in number, are Chinese. The aggregate commercial business transacted by these is about 60 per cent. of the total business done by all the merchants in the Islands. The total amount of their sales in 1923 was more than 320 millions of pesos, distributed among 3,335 wholesale merchants, of whom 50 did a business of 1,000,000 pesos each, 150 of 500,000 each, 400 of 100,000 each, and 2,735 of 40,000 each. There were 8,445 retail merchants, whose annual incomes on the average would not exceed 500 pesos each. In 1913, certain revenue statistics were reported by the then collector of internal revenue to the court of first instance in the case of Young v. Rafferty, 33 Philippine Reports, 556, in which the validity of an order by the collector requiring the keeping of certain books by taxpayers in Spanish and English was at issue. The figures given above are based on this report. The report showed that Chinese merchants paid about 60 per cent. of the taxes, but this is \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 513]\n\u00a0\n now in dispute, and evidence was introduced by the present collector to show that the proportion of taxes paid by them in 1918 and 1922 was much less, and that examination of the books of 400 Chinese taxpayers showed a very considerable loss, probably due to evasion and fraud.\n The evidence of the president of the largest company in the Philippine Islands, an American who has been 21 years in business in the Philippines, as to the business activities of the Chinese, was accepted by the court below as reliable. He says that the Chinese system of distribution covers the Philippine Islands through the medium of middlemen in the principal centers, and then by the small Chinese storekeepers, throughout the Islads, extending even to the remotest barrios or small settlements. The Chinese are the principal distributing factors in the Philippines of imported goods, and the principal gatherers of goods for exportation in the same remote places. He said that if they were driven out of business there would be no other system of distribution available throughout the Islands, for the reason that there are not Filipino merchants sufficiently numerous, with resources and experience, to provide a substitute.\n The Chinese consul general testified that not more than eight Chinese merchants in the Islands can read or write proficiently in any other language than Chinese, and that the great majority of them could not comply with the act. The merchants' establishments are made up of young Chinese persons, who come from China, begin at the beginning, and are promoted from time to time to become the head of the business. The books are always kept in the Chinese language, and each Chinese establishment is completely separated from the native mode of living.\n Apparently there has always been some complaint in respect to the avoidance of taxes by the Chinese, because \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 514]\n\u00a0\n of the difficulty of determining what their sales tax should be. There has always been a sales tax in the Philippines. It is a method of taxation to which the people are used. Dr. Pardo de Tavera, the Philippine librarian and historian, testified in this case that efforts to enforce such a law as this in the Spanish times against the Chinese failed and became a dead letter. Governor General Harrison made a general recommendation looking to a law requiring the Chinese to keep books in other than Chinese language, so that their business might be investigated, saying that, until it was done, taxes would be evaded. Since the passage of the law in 1921, as already said, its enforcement has been postponed. Governor General Wood has sought to have the law repealed or changed in such a way that exceptions might be made to it, or that the books of the Chinese should be kept on stamped paper with the pages registered, for the purpose of making it difficult for the Chinese taxpayer to change the records of his business. Protests from the Chinese government, from members of the insular committee of the House of Representatives, from Chambers of Commerce in the United States and elsewhere, were brought to the attention of the Philippine Legislature, and the repeal or modification of the law came up for discussion, but all proposed changes were defeated. The great weight of the evidence sustains the view that the enforcement by criminal punishment of an inhibition against the keeping of any Chinese books of account by Chinese merchants in the Islands would seriously embarrass all of them and would drive out of business a great number.\n Nor is there any doubt that the act as a fiscal measure was chiefly directed against the Chinese merchants. The discussion over its repeal in the Philippine Legislature leaves no doubt on this point. So far as the other merchants in the Islands are concerned, its results would be \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 515]\n\u00a0\n negligible and would operate without especial burden on other classes of foreign residents. The Supreme Court in its opinion in this case refers to the act as popularly known as the Chinese Bookkeeping Act.\n Evidence was introduced on behalf of the defendants to show the difficulty of securing competent Chinese bookkeepers who could act as inspectors of Chinese books for the tax collecting authorities, and while the failure of the government to employ a sufficient number was charged to the fact that sufficient salaries were not paid to secure them, it is undoubtedly true that a lack of proper and reliable Chinese accountants presents a real difficulty in the examination of Chinese merchants' books.\n The majority of the Philippine court in its opinion, after quoting a number of authorities showing the duty of a court in determining whether a law is unconstitutional or not, first to give every intendment possible to its validity, and second to reach a reasonable construction by which it may be preserved, said:\n'We come to the last question suggested, a construction of Act No. 2972 which allows the court legally to approve it.\n\n'A literal application of the law would make it unlawful for any Chinese merchant to keep his account books in any language other than English, Spanish, or a local dialect. The petitioners say the law is susceptible of that interpretation. But such interpretation might, and probably would, cause us to hold the law unconstitutional.\n\n'A second interpretation is that the Chinese merchant, while permitted to keep his books of account in Chinese, must also keep another set of books in either English, Spanish, or a native dialect. The respondents claim the law is susceptible of such construction. It occurs to us, however, that this construction might prove as unsatis- \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 516]\n\u00a0\n factory as the first. Fraud is possible in any language. As approximation to governmental convenience and an approximation to equality in taxation is the most which may be expected.\n\n'A third construction, which is permissible in view of the history of the legislation and the wording of the statute, is that the law only intended to require the keeping of such books as were necessary in order to facilitate governmental inspection for tax purposes. It has not escaped our notice that the law does not specify what books shall be kept. It is stated by competent witnesses that a cash book, a journal, and a ledger are indispensable books of account for an efficient system of accounting, and that, in the smaller shops, even simpler entries showing merely the daily records of sales and record of purchases of merchandise would be sufficient. The keeping of records of sales, and possibly further records of purchases, in English, Spanish, or a native dialect, and the filling out of the necessary forms would serve the purpose of the government while not being oppressive. Actually, notations in English, Spanish, or a dialect of all sales in sales books, and of data in other specified forms are insisted upon by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, although as appears from Exhibit 2, it is doubtful if all Chinese merchants have complied with these regulations. The faithful observance of such rules by the Chinese is not far removed from the offer of co- operation oft made for them by the petitioners of the 'translation of the account books' oft mentioned and explained by the respondents.\n\n'The law, in speaking of any person, company, partnership or corporation, makes use of the expression 'its account books.' Does the phrase 'its account books' mean that all the account books of the person, company, partnership or corporation must be kept exclusively in English, Spanish, or any local dialect? The petitioners argue that the law has this meaning. Or does the phrase 'its account books' mean that the persons, company, partnership, or corporation shall keep duplicate sets of account books, one set in Chinese and the other a translation into English, Spanish or any local dialect? Counsel for the respondents urge this construction of the law upon the court. \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 517]\n\u00a0\n Or does the phrase 'its account books' mean that the person, company, partnership, or corporation must keep such account books as are necessary for taxation purposes? This latter interpretation occurs to us as a reasonable one, and as best safeguarding the rights of the accused.'\n\n The court in effect concludes that what the Legislature meant to do was to require the keeping of such account books in English, Spanish, or the Filipino dialects as would be reasonably adapted to the needs of the taxing officers in preventing and detecting evasion of taxes, and that this might be determined from the statutes and regulations then in force. What the court really does is to change the law from one which by its plain terms forbids the Chinese merchants to keep their account books in any language except English, Spanish, or the Filipino dialects, and thus forbids them to keep account books in the Chinese, into a law requiring them to keep certain undefined books in the permitted languages. This is to change a penal prohibitive law to a mandatory law of great indefiniteness, to conform to what the court assumes was, or ought to have been, the purpose of the Legislature, and which in the change would avoid a conflict with constitutional restriction.\n It would seem to us, from the history of the legislation and the efforts for its repeal or amendment, that the Philippine Legislature knew the meaning of the words it used, and intended that the act as passed should be prohibitory, and should forbid the Chinese merchants from keeping the account books of their business in Chinese. \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 518]\n\u00a0\n Had the Legislature intended only what the Supreme Court has construed it to mean, why should it not have amended it accordingly? Apparently the Legislature thought the danger to the revenue was in the secrecy of the Chinese books, and additional books in the permitted languages would not solve the difficulty.\n We fully concede that it is the duty of a court in considering the validity of an act to give it such reasonable construction as can be reached to bring it within the fundamental law. But it is very clear that amendment may not be substituted for construction, and that a court may not exercise legislative functions to save the law from conflict with constitutional limitation.\n One of the strongest reasons for not making this law a nose of wax, to be changed from that which the plain language imports, is the fact that it is a highly penal statute authorizing sentence of one convicted under it to a fine of not more than 10,000 pesos, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. If we change it to meet the needs suggested by other laws and fiscal regulations and by the supposed general purpose of the legislation, we are creating by construction a vague requirement, and one objectionable in a criminal statute. We are likely thus to trespass on the provision of the Bill of Rights that the accused is entitled to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to violate the principle that a statute which requires the doing of an act so indefinitely described that men must guess at its meaning, violates due process of law. Connally v. Construction Co., (decided January 4, 1926) \n269 \nU.S. 385\n, 46 S. Ct. 126; United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216\n, 34 S. Ct. 853; United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, 219.\n The main objection to the construction given to the act by the court below is that in making the act indefinitely mandatory instead of broadly prohibitory it creates a \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 519]\n\u00a0\n restriction upon its operation to make it valid that is not in any way suggested by its language. In several cases this court has pointed out that such strained construction, in order to make a law conform to a constitutional limitation, cannot be sustained.\n In United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, the question for decision arose on a demurrer to an indictment against inspectors of municipal election for refusing to receive and count the vote of a colored man. The power of Congress to forbid such an act was confined under the Fifteenth Amendment to a refusal to receive such a vote from a colored man on account of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, but the section under which the indictment was brought did not specifically confine the offense to a refusal for such a reason or to such discrimination, although in previous sections of the act there was a general purpose disclosed in the act to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment. The demurrer was sustained on the ground that the section was invalid.\n Chief Justice Waite, in delivering the opinion of the court, said at page 221:\n'We are therefore directly called upon to decide whether a penal statute enacted by Congress, with its limited powers, which is in general language broad enough to cover wrongful acts without as well as within the constitutional jurisdiction, can be limited by judicial construction so as to make it operate only on that which Congress may rightfully prohibit and punish. For this purpose, we must take these sections of the statute as they are. We are not able to reject a part which is unconstitutional, and retain the remainder, because it is not possible to separate that which is unconstitutional, if there be any such, from that which is not. The proposed effect is not to be attained by striking out or disregarding words that are in the section, but by inserting those that are not now there. Each of the sections must stand as a \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 520]\n\u00a0\n whole, or fall altogether. The language is plain. There is no room for construction, unless it be as to the effect of the Constitution. The question then to be determined is whether we can introduce words of limitation into a penal statute, so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it is general only. It would certainly be dangerous if the Legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.'\n\n And again the Chief Justice said:\n'To limit this statute in the manner now asked for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. This is no part of our duty.'\n\n The same principle was laid down, and this language approved by this court in the Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, in which, to save the validity of a general statute providing for trade-marks, the court was asked to construe the statute to apply only to trade-marks in interstate commerce. It was held this could not be done. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court, at page 98, said:\n'It has been suggested that, if Congress has power to regulate trade- marks used in commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, these statutes shall be held valid in that class of cases, if no further. To this there are two objections: First, the indictments in these cases do not show that the trade-marks which are wrongfully used were trade-marks used in that kind of commerce; secondly, while it may be true that when one part of a statute is valid and constitutional, and another part is unconstitutional and void, the court may enforce the valid part where they are distinctly separable so that each can stand alone, it is not within the judicial province to give to the words used by Congress a narrower meaning \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 521]\n\u00a0\n than they are manifestly intended to bear in order that crimes may be punished which are not described in language that brings them within the constitutional power of that body.'\n\n The case of Butts v. Merchants' & Miners' Transportation Co., \n230 \nU.S. 126\n, 33 S. Ct. 964, concerned the application of the Civil Rights Act of March 1, 1875 (Comp. St.  3926-3930), to vessels of the United States engaged in the coastwise trade. In the Civil Rights Cases, \n109 \nU.S. 3\n, 3 S. Ct. 18, it was held that the Civil Rights Act of 1875, to protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights, and in accordance with the terms of which a defendant was indicted for denying the privileges and accommodations of a theater in a state to a person on account of her color, was unconstitutional because power to enact and enforce such legislation in a state was in the state legislature only. The declaration in the Butts Case was brought to recover penalties for violation of the act against a corporation engaged in the transportation of passengers and freight between Boston, Mass., and Norfolk, Va., and the discrimination occurred on the high seas and in the jurisdiction of the United States, and not within any state. It was contended that the federal Civil Rights Act could, therefore, apply in such a case. The court pointed out the all-inclusive words of the act of Congress and held that they could not be cut down to include only what was strictly within the federal jurisdiction. The court said:\n'Only by reason of the general words indicative of the intended uniformity can it be said that there was a purpose to embrace American vessels upon the high seas, the District of Columbia and the territories. But how can the manifest purpose to establish an uniform law for the entire jurisdiction of the United States be converted into a purpose to create a law for only a small fraction of that jurisdiction? How can the use of general terms denoting an intention to enact a law which should be appli- \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 522]\n\u00a0\n cable alike in all places within that jurisdiction be said to indicate a purpose to make a law which should be applicable to a minor part of that jurisdiction and inapplicable to the major part? Besides, it is not to be forgotten that the intended law is both penal and criminal'-citing the case of United States v. Reese, and the Trade-Mark Cases, supra, as well as United States v. Harris, \n106 \nU.S. 629, 642\n, 1 S. Ct. 601; Baldwin v. Franks, \n120 \nU.S. 678, 685\n, 7 S. Ct. 656, 763; James v. Bowman, \n190 \nU.S. 127, 140\n, 23 S. Ct. 678; United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 262\n, 25 S. Ct. 644; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. McKendree, \n203 U.S. 514\n, 529-530, 27 S. Ct. 153; Karem v. United States, 121 F. 250, 259, 57 C. C. A. 486, 61 L. R. A. 437.\n\n The effect of the authorities we have quoted is clear to the point that we may not in a criminal statute reduce its generally inclusive terms so as to limit its application to only that class of cases which it was within the power of the Legislature to enact, and thus save the statute from invalidity. What it is proposed to do here is much more radical, for it is to ignore and hold for naught a plain prohibition of the keeping of account books in Chinese and insert in the act an affirmative requirement that account books not definitely determined which are adapted to the needs of the taxing officials be kept in the permitted languages. This is quite beyond the judicial power.\n The suggestion has been made in argument that we should accept the construction put upon a statute of the Philippine Islands by their Supreme Court as we would the construction of a state court in passing upon the federal constitutionality of a state statute. The analogy is not complete. The Philippines are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States government, with complete power of legislation in Congress over them, and when the interpretation of a Philippine statute comes before us for review, we may, if there be need therefor, re-examine it for ourselves as the court of last resort on \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 523]\n\u00a0\n such a question. It is very true that with respect to questions turning on questions of local law, or those properly affected by custom inherited from the centuries of Spanish control, we defer much to the judgment of the Philippine or Porto Rican courts. Cami v. Central Victoria, Ltd., \n268 \nU.S. 469\n, 45 S. Ct. 570; Diaz v. Gonzales, \n261 \nU.S. 102\n, 43 S. Ct. 286. But on questions of statutory construction, as of the Philippine Code of Procedure adopted by the United States Philippine Commission, this court may exercise an independent judgment. In Philippine Sugar Co. v. Philippine Islands, \n247 U.S. 385\n, at page 390, 38 S. Ct. 513, 515 (62 L. Ed. 1177), involving the effect of section 285 of that Code, this court said:\n'It is also urged that, since the construction of section 285 is a matter of purely local concern, we should not disturb the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. This court is always disposed to accept the construction which the highest court of a territory or possession has placed upon a local statute. Phoenix Ry. Co. v. Landis, \n231 U.S. 578\n (34 S. Ct. 179). But that disposition may not be yielded to, where the lower court has clearly erred. Carrington v. United States, \n208 U.S. 1\n (28 S. Ct. 203).'\n\n The question of applying American constitutional limitations to a Philippine or Porto Rican statute, dealing, with the rights of persons living under the government established by the United States, is not a local one, especially when the persons affected are subjects of another sovereignty, with which the United States has made a treaty promising to make every effort to protect their rights. The fundamental law we administer in the Philippine bill of rights was a marked change from that which prevailed in the Islands before we took them over, and is to be enforced in the light of the construction by this court of such limitations as it has recognized them since the foundation of our own government. In its application here, we must determine for ourselves the necessary meaning of a statute officially enacted in English and its conformity with fundamental limitations.\n\n\n[271 U.S. 500, 524]\n\u00a0\n We cannot give any other meaning to the Bookkeeping Act than that which its plain language imports, making it a crime for any one in the Philippine Islands engaged in business to keep his account books in Chinese. This brings us to the question whether the law thus construed to mean what it says is invalid.\n The Philippine Bill of Rights, already referred to, provides that:\n'No law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n In Serra v. Mortiga, \n204 U.S. 470\n, at page 474, 27 S. Ct. 343, 345 ( 51 L. Ed. 571), this court said:\n'It is settled that by virtue of the Bill of Rights, enacted by Congress for the Philippine Islands (32 Stat. 691, 692), that guaranties equivalent to the due process and equal protection of the law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the twice in jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the substantial guaranties of the Sixth Amendment, exclusive of the right to trial by jury, were extended to the Philippine Islands. It is further settled that the guaranties which Congress has extended to the Philippine Islands are to be interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant at the time when Congress made them applicable to the Philippine Islands. Kepner v. United States, \n195 U.S. 100\n (24 S. Ct. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655).\n\n'For the purpose, therefore, of passing on the errors assigned we must test the correctness of the action of the court below by substantially the same criteria which we would apply to a case arising in the United States and controlled by the bill of rights expressed in the amendments to the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n In view of the history of the Islands and of the conditions there prevailing, we think the law to be invalid, because it deprives Chinese persons situated as they are, \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 525]\n\u00a0\n with their extensive and important business long established, of their liberty and property without due process of law, and denies them the equal protection of the laws.\n Of course the Philippine government may make every reasonable requirement of its taxpayers to keep proper records of their business transactions in English or Spanish or Filipino dialect by which an adequate measure of what is due from them in meeting the cost of government can be had. How detailed those records should be we need not now discuss, for it is not before us. But we are clearly of opinion that it is not within the police power of the Philippine Legislature, because it would be oppressive and arbitrary, to prohibit all Chinese merchants from maintaining a set of books in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese characters, and thus prevent them from keeping advised of the status of their business and directing its conduct. As the petitioner, Yu Cong Eng, well said in his examination, the Chinese books of those merchants who know only Chinese and do not know English and Spanish (and they constitute a very large majority of all of them in the Islands,) are their eyes in respect of their business. Without them such merchants would be a prey to all kinds of fraud and without possibility of adopting any safe policy. It would greatly and disastrously curtail their liberty of action, and be oppressive and damaging in the preservation of their property. We agree with the Philippine Supreme Court in thinking that the statute construed as we think it must be construed is invalid.\n In Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 137\n, 14 S. Ct. 499, 501 (38 L. Ed. 385), the court said:\n'To justify the state in thus interposing its authority in behalf of the public, it must appear, first, that the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, requires such interference; and, second, that the means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not unduly oppressive \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 526]\n\u00a0\n upon individuals. The Legislature may not, under the guise of protecting the public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private business, or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of its police powers is not final or conclusive, but is subject to the supervision of the courts.'\n\n In Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 398\n, 18 S. Ct. 383, 390 (42 L. Ed. 780), the court said:\n'The question in each case is whether the legislature has adopted the statute in exercise of a reasonable discretion, or whether its action be a mere excuse for an unjust discrimination, or the oppression or spoliation of a particular class.'\n\n In the case of Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A. L. R. 1446, this court considered the validity of state legislation making it unlawful to teach a foreign language to children, adopted on the theory that the state had the right to protect children likely to become citizens from study of a particular language, in which they might read and learn doctrine inimical to the Constitution of the United States and to the nation, and forbidding the teachers of the language from pursuing their occupation on this account, and held it invalid. The court said:\n'While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. ... The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of pro- \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 527]\n\u00a0\n tecting the public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect. Determination by the Legislature of what constitutes proper exercise of police power is not final or conclusive but is subject to supervision by the courts.'\n\n The same principle is laid down in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S. Ct. 571, 39 A. L. R. 468, in Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283, and in Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590\n, 37 S. Ct. 662, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973, in which this court has held legislative attempts arbitrary and oppressively to interfere with the liberty of the individual in the pursuit of lawful occupations to involve a lack of due process.\n In Adams v. Tanner, supra, an act to restrict the maintenance of employment agencies by forbidding the collection of fees from those seeking work, to avoid the extortion to which such workers were often subjected, was held unconstitutional. The court said at page 594 (37 S. Ct. 664):\n'Because abuses may, and probably do, grow up in connection with this business, is adequate reason for hedging it about by proper regulations. But this is not enough to justify destruction of one's right to follow a distinctly useful calling in an upright way. Certainly there is no profession, possibly no business, which does not offer peculiar opportunities for reprehensible practices; and as to every one of them, no doubt, some can be found quite ready earnestly to maintain that its suppression would be in the public interest. Skillfully directed agitation might also bring about apparent condemnation of any one of them by the public. Happily for all, the fundamental guaranties of the Constitution cannot be freely submerged if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced and the police power invoked.'\n\n In Truax v. Raich, supra, the people of the state of Arizona adopted an act, entitled 'An act to protect the \n\n[271 U.S. 500, 528]\n\u00a0\n citizens of the United States in their employment against noncitizens of the United States,' and provided that an employer of more than five workers at any one time in that state should not employ less than 80 per cent. qualified electors or native-born citizens, and that any employer who did so should be subject upon conviction to the payment of a fine and imprisonment. It was held that such a law denied aliens an opportunity of earning a livelihood and deprived them of their liberty without due process of law, and denied them the equal protection of the laws. As against the Chinese merchants of the Philippines, we think the present law which deprives them of something indispensable to the carrying on of their business, and is obviously intended chiefly to affect them as distinguished from the rest of the community, is a denial to them of the equal protection of the laws.\n We hold the law in question to be invalid.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The opinion was announced by Mr. Justice Holmes, the Chief Justice being absent. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
